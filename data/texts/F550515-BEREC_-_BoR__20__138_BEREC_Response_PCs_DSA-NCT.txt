EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

BEREC welcomes the public consultations of the European Commission (EC) on the Digital 
Services  Act  (DSA)  and  the  New  Competition  Tool  (NCT)  which  address  important 
regulatory  issues  to  be  considered  when  regulating  digital  platforms  (DPs).  Finding  a 
regulatory  approach  which  ensures  the  right  balance  between  flexibility,  predictability  and 
proportionality  will  be  key,  given  the  increasing  importance  of  DPs  and  their  role  in  the 
economy and society at large, both now and in the years to come.  

There is a broad acknowledgment of the benefits brought about by DPs for innovation and 
consumers’  choice.  Through  innovative  business  models,  DPs  have  provided  opportunities 
for  small  businesses  and  start-ups  for  access  to  and  expansion  into  new  markets  across 
Europe.  They  have  facilitated  access  for  both  business-  and  end-users  to  goods,  services 
and  data,  and  have  provided  a  wide  range  of  efficiencies  by  reducing  transaction,  search 
and distribution costs.  

However,  BEREC  also  recognises  that  there  are  increasing  concerns  over  the  entrenched 
power  of  some  large  DPs  and  the  control  they  exert  over  an  overarching  variety  of goods, 
services  and  information,  as  well  as  over  inputs  and  assets  which  are  crucial  to  fostering 
effective competition and innovation (e.g. data).  

In  order  to  address  these  concerns,  BEREC  considers  that  establishing  a  well-designed 
regulatory framework for DPs with Significant Intermediation Power (SIP) could allow for an 
efficient, proportionate, and predictable scheme for intervention.  

It  is  important  to  stress  that  such  ex-ante  intervention  would  not  be  aimed  at  regulating  all 
DPs, nor the internet as a whole, but at tackling specific concerns raised by DPs with SIP, in 
order to  ensure  that  competition  and  innovation  are  encouraged, that  end-users’ rights  are 
protected and that the digital environment is open and competitive. 

The regulatory model presented by BEREC in its response to the DSA consultation should 
be  considered  as  a  first  step  on  this  path,  a  blue-print  for  a  regulatory  framework.  BEREC 
aims  to  continue  to  contribute  to  the  regulatory  debate  on  DPs  to  further  refine  the  details 
and to analyse the implications of its proposal. BEREC would like to stress its willingness to 
continue to work with the European institutions and other relevant stakeholders on this topic.  

The regulatory challenges raised by DPs are not new to BEREC and have already been the 
subject  of  some  recent  reports,  such  as  the  “BEREC  report  on  the  impact  of  premium 
content on ECS markets and the effect of devices on the open use of the Internet” (BoR (18) 
35)1  where  BEREC  addressed  issues  concerning,  among  others,  app  stores,  and  the 
“BEREC  Report  on  the  Data  Economy”  (BoR  (19)  106).2  Furthermore,  BEREC  is  currently 
working on a report on the economic analysis of digital platforms and has commissioned an 
external study on consumer behaviour towards DPs as a means for communication, both to 
be published in 2021.

BEREC response to the public consultation on the DSA Package 

Throughout  its  response,  BEREC  focuses  on  the  challenges  and  concerns  raised  by  large 
digital  platforms  (rather  than  just  “online”  platforms),  to  also  take  account  of  the  issues 
related  to  platforms  not  strictly  providing  online  services,  but  which  may  still  control  and 
influence access to them.3  

BEREC identifies both structural and behavioural concerns that can have negative effects on 
competition dynamics, users and society at large.  

As  for  the  structural  issues,  BEREC  recognises  that  the  control  of  some  large  DPs  over  a 
digital bottleneck and/or key inputs/assets provides them with SIP and therefore the ability to 
behave  independently  from  their  users  (business  users  but  also  consumers),  regardless  of 
their behaviour. The fact that such DPs with SIP may represent an unavoidable gateway to 
access a wide variety of services on the Internet, or to reach other users, raises concerns as 
to their effect, even beyond their area(s) of business, on competition, innovation as well as 
users’ freedom of choice.  

As for the behavioural concerns, BEREC identifies unfair practices which DPs with SIP have 
the ability and may have the incentive to engage in (e.g. inter alia, unfair denial of access to 
essential  inputs/assets,  refusal  of  proportionate  interoperability,  imposing  unreasonable 
terms and conditions, etc. which become even more relevant in the context of ecosystems), 
and  which  should  be  prevented  ex  ante,  given  the  potentially  irreversible  effects  on 
competition  (including  the  development  of  new  services  or  ecosystems),  innovation  and 
users’ choice.  

In  order  to  address  these  concerns,  BEREC  recommends  adopting  a  dedicated  ex-ante 
regulatory  framework,  adapted  to  the  specificities  of  the  digital  environment,  for  several 
reasons.  

First of all, some of the identified concerns result from structural features, which should be 
addressed  independently  of  any  (potentially)  unfair  behaviour  by the  DP  with  SIP. In  some 
circumstances, conditions for effective competition need to be created, or at least facilitated, 
in  order  to  achieve  efficient  outcomes.  Ex-ante  asymmetric  regulation,  supported  by  an 
efficient  regulatory 
to  foster  competition  and 
contestability.  

toolbox,  has  proven 

to  be  effective 

Secondly,  an  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  is  better  suited  to  pursue  a  variety  of  different 
objectives  which  are  not  only  competition-related  but  have  a  positive  impact  on  users,  the 
internal  market  and  society  at  large.  Along  with  fostering  competition,  pursuing  multiple 
objectives – such as supporting an open internet or achieving the European internal market 
– within a single regulatory framework would ensure a more comprehensive and consistent 
intervention.  

Thirdly, the difficulties in applying the current ex-post analytical framework and enforcement 
tools  (e.g.  defining  relevant  markets,  need  for  recurring  interventions  to  address  structural 
issues,  lengthy  intervention  procedures  to  tackle  abusive  practices  in  fast-evolving 
intervention, 
environments,)  call 

for  a  different  approach.  A  streamlined  ex-ante 

3 E.g. operating systems

BoR (20) 138 

complementing the current ex post intervention, appears to be more efficient for consistently 
solving competition problems in fast-moving digital environments.  

Finally,  a  coherent  regulatory  framework  would  imply  repeated  interactions  both  with  DPs 
with  SIP  and  other  stakeholders  (business  users,  other  relevant  authorities,  consumer 
associations,  civil  society  representatives,  etc.),  allowing  for  an  effective  definition, 
implementation  and  monitoring  of  remedies,  for  reducing  information  asymmetries,  as  well 
as for adjusting the regulatory intervention to relevant developments. 

BEREC and its members have considerable experience in applying ex-ante regulation in the 
sector  for  electronic  communications  services  (ECS)  to  address  structural  competition 
problems, as well as broader societal concerns (e.g. open internet). Building on this, BEREC 
considers  that  its  expertise  can  contribute  to  effectively  designing  a  new  dedicated 
regulatory model for DPs with SIP, for the benefit of European citizens and businesses.  

BEREC proposes a streamlined process to identify the DPs with SIP and a model for ex-ante 
asymmetric regulation towards them.  

First of all, BEREC recommends that specific Area(s) of Business (AoB – e.g., app stores, 
online search, OSs, voice assistants) should be defined. Such AoBs would be characterised, 
inter  alia,  by  strong  direct  and  indirect  network  effects,  significant  economies  of  scale  and 
scope,  barriers  to  entry  and  expansion,  and  high  switching  costs.  The  list  of  AoBs  would 
allow  for  differentiating  among  services  and  set  relevant  corresponding  thresholds  (see 
below).  

DPs with SIP would typically be active in one or more AoB(s) and would be identified based 
on a combination of criteria:  

•  First of all, the control over a digital bottleneck (i.e. over a gateway for which there is no 
relevant substitute) for a large amount of end-users, and/or being an unavoidable trading 
partner  for  a  large  amount  of  business  users.  This  would  result  in  controlling  users’ 
access to: (i) a relevant amount of services, goods and/or content, or (ii) the digital space 
where  users  share,  sell  or  exchange  services/goods/content;  or  (iii)  another  group  of 
users; and/or (iv) key inputs or assets which are essential for competitors or providers of 
complementary services. 

Moreover, the SIP can be strengthened by 

•  Strong financial resources and/or easy or privileged access to capital markets,  

•  The DP’s organisation into an ecosystem allowing it to leverage its power onto additional 
services/businesses,  and/or to  have  privileged  or exclusive  access to key  inputs/assets 
from  its  different  businesses,  thus  contributing  to  raising  barriers  to  entry  or  expansion 
(e.g. by accumulation of data). 

BEREC recognises the need to ensure swift intervention and regulatory predictability. To this 
end, the main identification process relies on a direct identification of DPs with SIP by means 
of  reasonable  and  easily-observable  absolute  thresholds  for  each  AoB  (e.g.  revenues, 
number  of  unique  users,  etc.)  in  order  to  quickly  identify  the  large  DPs  who  are  legally 
presumed  to  have  SIP  without  any  further  assessment  by  the  competent  body.  The  list  of 
AoBs,  the  structural  and  specific  criteria  to  assess  the  DP’s  SIP,  as  well  as  the  absolute 

5 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

thresholds for direct identification would be defined in (an) EU-level act(s) which should be 
regularly revised. 

BEREC also recognises that some DPs active in one/some specific AoB(s) and presenting a 
combination  of  relevant  structural  and  specific  features,  may  not  be  large  enough  to  meet 
the  absolute  thresholds  set  for  distinctive  AoB,  but  still  be  in  a  position  to  de  facto  exert  a 
SIP. In order to tackle this SIP and as far as it is deemed strictly necessary to address the 
identified  concerns,  BEREC  proposes  an  optional  identification  process  in  which  the 
competent  body  may  conduct  individual  SIP  assessments  ex  officio  or  intervene  based  on 
complaints. 

Irrespective  of  the  identification  process  (direct  or  optional),  all  DPs  with  SIP  should  be 
subject to an asymmetric regulatory intervention consisting of (i) principle-based obligations 
and  prohibitions  (e.g.  transparency  and  non-discrimination  among  business  users,  i.e. 
Option  3a  of  the  DSA  inception  impact  assessment),  and,  (ii)  tailored  and  proportionate 
remedies  when  necessary  (depending  on the  nature  and  the  level  of  issues  at  stake, such 
remedies could include access to essential inputs and/or assets, e.g. some level of services 
interoperability  through  the  use  of  open  APIs  or  open  standards  and  data  portability).  This 
would correspond to Option 3b of the DSA inception impact assessment. 

Moreover, in order to be effective,  BEREC supports a data-driven regulatory approach and 
believes  that  the  regulatory  toolbox  should  include  specific  tools  aimed  at  enhancing 
information gathering and sharing with relevant stakeholders, in compliance with legislations 
concerning data protection and business confidentiality.  

Finally,  BEREC  also  makes  an  initial  proposal  for  a  potential  governance  model  to 
implement the ex-ante regulatory intervention towards DPs with SIP.  

First  of  all,  there  are  number  of  important  features  which  any  regulatory  authority  with 
responsibility for regulating DPs with SIP should benefit from. Regulatory authorities should 
be  independent,  have  relevant  expertise  in  relation  to  ex-ante  regulation  and  the  ability  to 
encompass multiple perspectives (i.e. technical, economic, legal, accounting and end-users’ 
rights).  

Moreover, in BEREC’s view, the geographical scope (pan-EU, regional, meaning several EU 
countries,  or  national)  of  the  concerns  raised  by  DPs  should  determine  which  regulatory 
body/bodies  is/are  involved  in  defining  the  regulatory  measures,  as  well  as  their 
enforcement. BEREC believes that there is a need for a specific regulatory authority at the 
European level, collaborating with a strong network of regulatory authorities represented in 
an  Advisory  Body.  This  would  ensure  a  harmonised  implementation  of  the  regulatory 
framework for DPs with SIP.  

The  BEREC  cooperation  framework  can  be  considered  as  a  well-functioning  reference 
model. BEREC and its member NRAs are well placed to effectively take on the roles of the 
Advisory  Board  and  the  National  Regulatory  Bodies  as  presented  in  the  proposed 
institutional  design.  This  would  have  the  advantage  of  building  on  their  valuable  ex  ante-
experience and structure and would allow for a faster institutional set-up. 

This being said, even though BEREC considers the proposed institutional design as a fully 
efficient option, this is one possible governance model among others. Irrespective of whether 

6 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

the  suggested  model  is  adopted,  BEREC  believes  that  its  proposed  ex-ante  regulatory 
framework  for  intervention  (SIP  assessment,  the  dedicated  rules  and  tailored  remedies) 
remains well-suited to address the identified concerns. 

BEREC response to the public consultation on the NCT 

Regarding  the  public  consultation  on  the  NCT,  BEREC  focuses  on  its  interplay  with  the 
existing  ECS  regulatory  framework,  which  has  been  successfully  applied  by  BEREC 
members for over twenty years, as well as the interplay with the proposed ex-ante regulatory 
framework for DPs with SIP. 

BEREC stresses that the ex-ante regulatory framework for ECS is already addressing most 
structural competition issues, as well as reaching a variety of broader objectives. The NCT, if 
implemented  by 
the  competent  regulatory  authority,  could  potentially  serve  as  a 
complementary  tool  in  exceptional  cases  not  currently  addressed  by  sectoral  regulation. 
Nevertheless, attention should be paid to potential overlap between the ECS framework and 
the  NCT  since  this  could  raise  legal  uncertainty  and  have  serious  implications  for 
investments in a dynamic and competitive sector. In order to address this potential overlap, 
and following the principle of lex specialis, the regulatory framework for ECS should be the 
applicable legislation. 

Moreover,  BEREC  believes  that,  given  its  two-decade  experience  in  the  sector,  ECS 
regulatory authorities are in the best position (as they are already doing so) to carry out an 
analysis aimed at identifying structural competition concerns in the ECS markets which are 
not  addressed  by  the  current  regulatory  framework.  If  the  need  for  further  regulatory 
intervention  is  identified  in  this  sector,  then  NRAs  should  be  empowered  with  appropriate, 
necessary  tools  and  competences  in  order  to  ensure  an  effective  and  consistent 
implementation of the sectoral regulatory framework. This could be done by a revision of the 
existing framework or by assigning the power of applying the NCT in the ECS sector to the 
competent NRAs, in order to avoid an overlap in competences between different authorities. 

Similarly,  the  regulatory  model  for  DPs  with  SIP  proposed  by  BEREC  is  also  designed  to, 
inter  alia,  address  structural  and  competition  concerns  in  digital  environments.  Therefore, 
BEREC  believes  that  the  challenges  identified  in  these  environments  could  only  be 
effectively  targeted  by  an  ex-ante  intervention  within  a  specific,  consistent  regulatory 
framework, rather than by a general-purpose ex-ante tool (e.g. NCT), which may not reach 
the same objective(s).  

Final remarks 

Finally, BEREC would like to stress its willingness to further build on the stable cooperation 
with  the  EC,  and  to  continue  to  work  with  the  European  institutions  and  other  relevant 
stakeholders on this topic.  

BEREC  is  also  currently  working  on  a  report  on DPs  which  will  develop  the  suggested  ex-
ante  approach  regarding  DPs  with  SIP  in  further  details.  As  always,  any  input  from  the 
European  institutions  and  relevant  stakeholders  on  BEREC’s  work  in  this  topic  will  be 
welcome,  and  BEREC  would  also  welcome  the  opportunity  to  share  its  experience  and 
expertise.

INTRODUCTION 

BEREC welcomes the public consultations by the European Commission (EC) on the Digital 
Services Act (DSA) Package4 and the New Competition Tool (NCT)5 which address some of 
the key issues to be considered when regulating digital platforms (DPs)6.  

BEREC recognises the benefits brought about by DPs for innovation and consumers’ choice. 
DPs  have  created  and/or  enabled  innovative  business  models,  and  have  also  provided 
opportunities for small  businesses  and  start-ups for  access  and  expansion  in  new  markets 
across  Europe.  They  have  facilitated  access  by  both  business  and  end-users  to  goods, 
services and information, and provided a wide range of efficiencies by reducing transaction, 
search and distribution costs.  

However,  BEREC  also  recognises  that  there  are  increasing  concerns  over  the  entrenched 
power of large DPs and the control they exert over an overarching variety of goods, services, 
data  and  information,  as  well  as  over  inputs  and  assets  which  are  crucial  to  fostering 
effective competition and innovation.  

BEREC  and  its  members  have  a  long  and  considerable  experience  in  applying  ex-ante 
regulation  in  the  ECS sector to  address  structural  competition  problems, as  well  as  certain 
societal  concerns.  Building  on  this,  BEREC  considers  that  its  expertise  can  contribute  to 
effectively designing a regulatory model for intervention towards DPs with SIP.  

BEREC  considers  that  establishing  a  specialised  regulatory  framework  for  DPs  with 
Significant  Intermediation  Power  (SIP)  could  allow  for  a  well-designed,  proportionate,  and 
predictable  scheme  for  intervention.  Such  ex-ante  intervention  would  not  be  aimed  at 
regulating  the  digital  sector,  nor  the  Internet  as  a  whole,  but  at  tackling  specific  concerns 
raised by DPs with SIP, in order to ensure that competition and innovation are encouraged, 
that  end-users’  rights  are  protected,  and  that  the  digital  related  environment  is  open  and 
competitive. 

The present document is structured as follows:  

In  Section  1,  BEREC  presents  its  views  on  some  selected  questions  of  the  Public 
Consultation on the DSA Package, and proposes a model for intervention towards DPs with 
SIP. 

In Section 2, BEREC presents its views on the New Competition Tool (NCT) and its interplay 
with both ECS regulation and the proposed regulatory framework for DPs with SIP.  

The  model  proposed  in  Section  1  is  built  on  BEREC’s  experience  gathered  in  ex-ante 
regulation in the ECS sector (that may be adjustable in many aspects to DPs), as well as on 
the insights and analyses on DPs carried out by some of its members in the last years. DPs 
and the digital economy have already been the subject of some recent BEREC reports, such

consultation 

6  BEREC’s  response  focuses  on  digital  platforms  (DPs),  rather  than  online  platforms,  in  order  to  also  take 
account  of  the  challenges  raised  by  platforms  not  strictly  providing  online  services  but  still  controlling  and 
influencing access to them, such as operating systems

as the “BEREC report on the impact of premium content on ECS markets and the effect of 
devices  on  the  open  use  of  the  Internet”  (BoR  (18)  35)7  where  BEREC  addressed  issues 
concerning, among others, app stores, and the “BEREC Report on the Data Economy” (BoR 
(19) 106).8  

BEREC is currently working on a report on DPs in which the outlined ex-ante framework will 
be  elaborated  and  explained  in  further  details.  BEREC  has  also  commissioned  a  study  on 
consumer  behaviour  towards  digital  platforms  as  a  means  for  communication,  both  to  be 
published in 2021, and which will contribute to the understanding of DPs.  

BEREC would like to stress its willingness to further build on the stable cooperation with the 
EC, and to continue to work with the European institutions and other relevant stakeholders 
on this topic. As always, any input from the European institutions and relevant stakeholders 
on BEREC’s work on this topic will be welcome, and BEREC would welcome the opportunity 
to share its experience and expertise.

1.  PUBLIC  CONSULTATION  ON  THE  DIGITAL  SERVICES 

ACT PACKAGE 

Section  III:  What  issues  derive  from  the  gatekeeper  power  of 
digital platforms? 

Main  features  of  gatekeeper  online  platform  companies  and  main 
relevant criteria for assessing their economic power  

Question  2  (Section  III;  Main  features  of  gatekeeper  online  platform  companies  and 
main relevant criteria for assessing their economic power) 

Which characteristics are relevant in determining the gatekeeper role of large online platform 
companies? 

In its response, BEREC will focus on digital platforms (DPs), rather than online platforms, to 
include  platforms  not  strictly  providing  online  services  but  which  may  still  control  and 
influence  access  to  them  (e.g.  operating  systems).  BEREC  considers  that  the  “gatekeeper 
role” is not the only factor strengthening the power of large DPs. Given the main role of DPs 
as intermediary between several types of users (business users – including competitors and 
providers  of  complementary  services  –  and  end-users  –  mostly  consumers),  and  between 
users  and  a  variety  of  services/products,  BEREC  considers  that  DPs  should  be  targeted 
based  on  their  Significant  Intermediation  Power  (SIP).  Similarly  to  the  assessment  of 
significant market power in the ECS sector, SIP should be identified based on a combination 
of structural and specific criteria. 

First  of  all,  given  the  challenges  in  defining  clear  boundaries  for  relevant  markets  in  which 
DPs  operate,  BEREC  proposes  to  focus  on  the  Area(s)  of  Business  (AoB)  in  which  DPs 
present structural/specific criteria. The list of AoBs should be laid down in (an) EU-level legal 
act(s)  and  should  be  subject  to  regular  revision.  An  AoB  could  be  e.g.  e-commerce,  app 
stores,  online  search,  OS,  voice  assistants  etc.,  and  would  be  characterised  by  features 
such as: 

•  strong direct and indirect network effects, 

•  significant economies of scale and scope, 

•  significant barriers to entry and expansion relating to technical and/or legal aspects,  

•  high switching costs and/or consumer inertia. 

Based  on  this,  the  identification  of  DPs  with  SIP  would  be  based  on  a  combination  of 
structural and specific criteria, also defined in (an) EU-level legal act(s): 

•  First  of  all,  the  control  over  a  digital  bottleneck  (for  which  there  is  no  relevant 
substitute)  for  a  large  amount  of  end-users,  and/or  being  an  unavoidable  trading 
partner for  a  large  amount  of business  users. This  would  result  in  controlling  users’ 
access:  

10 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

- 

- 

to  services/goods/content;  or  to  the  digital  space  where  users  share,  sell  or 
exchange services/goods/content; or to another group of end-users, and/or  

to key inputs/assets which are essential in order to compete with the platform 
or  to  provide  complementary  services  (e.g.  non-replicable  and  essential 
usage data, or certain functionalities)  

Moreover, the SIP can be strengthened by:  

•  Strong financial resources and/or easy or privileged access to capital markets, 

•  Being  organised  into  an  ecosystem  allowing  the  DP  to  leverage  its  power  onto 
additional  services/businesses,  and/or  to  have  privileged/exclusive  access  to  key 
inputs/assets  from  its  different  businesses,  thus  further  raising  barriers  to  entry  or 
expansion (e.g. by accumulation of data). 

BEREC considers that a combination of these criteria would provide some DPs with SIP and 
allow  them  to  behave  independently  of  their  competitors,  business  users  and  end-users, 
thereby affecting (and possibly restraining) competition, and/or raising societal concerns. 

Question  3  (Section  III;  Main  features  of  gatekeeper  online  platform  companies  and 
main relevant criteria for assessing their economic power)  

How  could  different  criteria  be  combined  to  accurately  identify  large  online  platform 
companies with gatekeeper role? 

In  fast-evolving  digital  environments,  timely  intervention  is  key.  BEREC  would  therefore 
support the implementation of a general streamlined process for SIP assessment. This being 
said,  digital  environments  also  call  for  a  flexible  and  dynamic  approach,  taking  account  of 
specific circumstances.  

BEREC’s  proposed  model  encompassing  direct  and  optional  identification  of  DPs  with  SIP 
aims at ensuring predictability and still leaves room for flexibility, when it is deemed strictly 
necessary  to  tackle  the  concerns  raised  by  DPs  with  SIP  (See  Q9-13  below  –  Emerging 
issues).  

As  regards  the  direct  identification  process  of  DPs  with  SIP,  BEREC  suggests  that 
reasonable  and  easily-observable  absolute  thresholds  (e.g.  revenues,  number  of  unique 
users, etc.) for each AoB, are defined in (an) EU-level legal act(s), in order to quickly identify 
the large DPs who are presumed to have SIP. These thresholds may vary depending on the 
respective  AoB  and  should  be set  at  such  a  level  that  does  not  impact SMEs  and/or small 
platforms  which  are  less  likely  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  AoB  they  are  active  in. 
These thresholds could be subject to the same regular revision as the definition of AoB. For 
a  DP  being  active  in  a  pre-defined  AoB  and meeting  the  identified  thresholds for this  AoB, 
the combination of criteria listed in Q2 above and the presence of SIP would be presumed 
without any further assessment by the competent body. 

BEREC  also  recognises  that  some  DPs  active  in  one/some  specific  AoB(s)  (for  example 
B2B-platforms for certain industries) and presenting a combination of relevant structural and 
specific criteria, may not be large enough to meet the absolute thresholds set for distinctive 
AoB, but still be in a position to de facto exert a SIP. In order to tackle this SIP, which would 

11 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

not  be  identified  by  the direct  SIP  identification process,  and  as far  as  it  is  deemed  strictly 
necessary  to  address  the  concerns,  BEREC  proposes  an  optional  identification  process  in 
which  the  competent  body  may  conduct  individual  SIP  assessments  ex officio  or  intervene 
based on complaints.  

BEREC  believes  that  this  double  approach  (direct  identification  of  DPs  with  SIP  based  on 
absolute thresholds, as well as the possibility for an individual SIP assessment when strictly 
needed  to  tackle  relevant  concerns  which  would  not  be  addressed  by  a  direct  SIP 
identification process) is better-suited to ensure timely intervention, regulatory predictability, 
and to enable digital environments to thrive.  

Irrespective of the identification process, all DPs with SIP are targeted by ex-ante principle-
based prohibitions and obligations and – if needed – by tailored remedies based on a case-
by-case assessment conducted by the competent body. 

The chart here below presents BEREC’s SIP identification process. 

Question  5  (Section  III;  Main  features  of  gatekeeper  online  platform  companies  and 
main relevant criteria for assessing their economic power)  

Do  you  believe  that  the  integration  of  any  or  all  of  the  following  activities  within  a  single 
company  can  strengthen 
large  online  platform  companies 
(‘conglomerate effect’)?  

the  gatekeeper  role  of 

Yes.  

Conglomerates  offer  (seemingly)  independent  goods/services.  When  goods/services  are 
interrelated (e.g. by interoperability or by combining, monetising and using the data collected 
by the provision of existing and new goods/services), ecosystem effects are relevant.  

Ecosystems  can  yield  efficiencies  (e.g.  more  data  generating  activities  and  users  implying 
more efficient data collection/aggregation, facilitating new/improved services and increasing 
economies of scale/scope and network effects).  

12 

 
 
 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

They can also entail negative aspects, requiring multi-market entry by competitors, stronger 
effects in case of unfair practices - see Q9 below -, affecting more business- and end-users.  

For  users,  interrelated  services  may  reduce  transaction  costs,  but  potentially  also  the 
incentive  to  venture  outside  the  ecosystem  (lock-in  effect).  These  aspects  may  strengthen 
the DP’s intermediation power, impacting terms and conditions, the type of information and 
the supply of goods/services offered.  

Emerging issues  

Question 9 (Section III; Emerging issues)  

Are  there  specific  issues  and  unfair  practices  you  perceive  on  large  online  platform 
companies? 

Concerns  raised  by  a  DP  with  SIP  can  be  due  to  features  which  can  be  structural  or 
behavioural  (e.g.  unfair  practices).  The  suggestion  put  forward  by  BEREC  is  to  propose  a 
regulatory framework to tackle both kinds of features.  

Structural  features  in  relation  to  AoB  are  set  forth  under  Q2  above  (Main  features  of 
gatekeeper  online  platform  companies);  how  to  combine  the  relevant  criteria  in  order  to 
identify  the  DPs  which  should  be  targeted  by  an  ex-ante  intervention  is  presented  in  Q3 
above (Main features of gatekeeper online platform companies). 

BEREC  recognises  that DPs  with  SIP  have the ability  and  may  have  the  incentive to  carry 
out certain practices and behaviours which may be harmful and should be prevented by ex-
ante regulation complementing the current ex post intervention. These include: 

1.  Exclusionary  conducts  (practices 

that  remove  or  weaken  actual  and  potential 

competition, directly or indirectly harming business users and/or end-users): 

a)  Self-preferencing,  e.g.  unfairly  favouring  own  products  and  services  to  the 
detriment of competing businesses. Examples: a) unfair ranking/steering, b) pre-
installation and default settings of only one’s own products/services. 

b)  Preferencing  of  a  specific  third  party.  Unfairly  favouring  a  third  party’s  products 
and  services  to  the  detriment  of  competing  businesses.  Examples:  a)  unfair 
ranking/steering  for  third  parties  products  or  services,  b)  pre-installation  and 
default  settings  of  that  third  party’s  products/services,  c)  discrimination  in 
enforcing terms and condition without reasonable cause. 

c)  Unjustified  denial  of  access  (permanent  or  temporary)  to  the  platform  or 
functionalities on the platform necessary to conduct business. Example: a) denial 
of access to sell products or services via the DPs platform, b) denial of access to 
the DPs payment services. 

d)  Imposing exclusionary terms and conditions for attaining and/or retaining access. 
Examples: a) unfair blocking (e.g. the DP with SIP blocking certain functionalities 
offered by app providers/developers such as other payment services than the DP 

13 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

with  SIP’s  own  without  reasonable  cause),  b)  unfair  delisting,  c)  unreasonable 
performance targets. 

e)  Unjustified denial of access to relevant data on reasonable terms where barriers 
to  replication  are  high  and  non-transitory.  Example:  refusing  access  on  fair, 
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms to the data that end-users allow the DP 
with SIP to share (refusal to deal). 

f)  Unjustified  refusal  of  proportionate  interoperability.  Refusal  might  be  legitimate 
where when it may compromises security or privacy or is excessively costly with 
respect to the benefits that may be achieved. 

g)  Tying  and  bundling  (e.g.  with  the  goods/services  offered  by  the  DP  with  SIP, 
and/or specific third-party  business  users)  if the conduct  e.g.  reduces  the  ability 
of  competitors  to  provide  a  specific  service/good  or  requires  them  to  enter 
multiple  markets,  or  at  least  offer  additional  products  or  services,  in  order  to 
compete and is not objectively justified. 

its  end-users 

h)  Unreasonably restricting the possibility for business users to provide information 
to 
the  platform.  Example:  stopping  providers  of 
complementary  services  from  informing  end-users  about  alternative  avenues 
where their complementary service can be consumed/purchased.  

through 

i)  Strategically  and  unreasonably  denying  business  users’  access  to  relevant 
information  which  would  be  essential 
their  products/services 
interoperable  with  those  of  the  DP  with  SIP’s  business  user  and  thus  to  reach 
end-users on a market where the DP with SIP wants to remain exclusive.  

for  making 

2.  Exploitative  conducts  (practices  that  are  harming  business  users  and/or  end-users 

directly): 

a)  Imposing unreasonable terms and conditions for business users for access to the 
platform  (including  aftermarkets),  to  data  or  to  other  essential  inputs.  Example: 
excessive pricing. 

b)  Imposing  unreasonable  terms  and  conditions  to  end-users  for  access  to  the 

platform. Example: excessive gathering of end-user data. 

c)  Gathering and combining end-user data from all or various business units where 

the DP with SIP is active and other third party sources without consent.  

d)  Refusing data portability with the result of de facto locking end-users in (making it 

very difficult or impossible to switch platform). 

3.  Transparency-related issues: 

a)  Strategic  use  of  unclear  or  incomplete  terms  and  conditions  towards  business 

users. 

b)  Lack of transparency towards content providers (business users as well as end-

users) as to the rules of ranking algorithms.  

14 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

These concerns could cause negative economic and/or other societal effects, as described 
in BEREC’s response to Q11 and Q13 below. 

Even though it is an M&A issue and not an issue to be regulated within the present context, 
it is worth mentioning that large DPs with significant financial resources may also use such 
funding to acquire/control significant stakes in promising competitors. If the stakes are used 
to suppress direct competition, negative effects may arise. 

Question 10 (Section III; Emerging issues) 

In  your  view,  what  practices  related  to  the  use  and  sharing  of  data  in  the  platforms’ 
environment are raising particular challenges? 

By attracting more users and collecting large amounts of data and more relevant data, some 
DPs with SIP are able to improve the quality of their current products/services, easily provide 
new ones and acquire even more users (user feedback loop).  

The  analysis  of  increasing relevant  user  data  can  give  DPs  a  better  understanding  of  both 
users’  needs  and  market  trends.  It  will  also  reinforce  their  ability  to  engage  in  behaviours 
which  protects  them  from  inter-platform  competition  (such  as  acquiring  or  foreclosing 
nascent  rivals)  or  intra-platform  competition  (such  as  imposing  unfair  –  exclusionary  or 
exploitative – terms and conditions, or denying access to data). End-user data can also be 
collected in an unfair and/or non-transparent way. 

It is important to keep in mind that collecting data or being in control of large amounts of data 
is  not  an  anti-competitive  conduct  in  itself  (unless  it  is  excessive,  see  Q9  above,  point  2b) 
but  with  that  being  said,  large  amounts  of  data  and  data-sharing  between  services  might 
lead to an increase of barriers to entry and increase SIP, i.e. give more power to leverage.  

In  cases  where  barriers  to  entry  do  arise,  there  may  be  a  risk  for  reduced  innovation  and 
competition from alternative actors, which might ultimately lead to reduced consumer choice 
(see also Q11 below). Also, a DP with SIP possessing large amounts of relevant data that 
constitute  essential  input  is  in  a  position  to  cause  harm  in  relation  to  the  provision  of  the 
goods/services  where  the  DP  has  SIP  (the  conduct  would  be  denying  access  to  relevant 
non-replicable  data).  It  could  also  cause  harm  in  providing  other  (potentially  currently  non-
existing)  goods/services  by  leveraging  its  SIP  into  complementary  services  (e.g.  by 
increasing  the  entry  barriers,  for  the  services  where  the  DP  has  SIP  –  such  as  combining 
data  from  several  different  AoBs  –,  or  for  leveraging  other  goods/services)  in  a  way  that 
reduces consumer welfare. 

Question 11 (Section III; Emerging issues)  

What  impact  would  the  identified  unfair  practices  can  have  on  innovation,  competition  and 
consumer choice in the single market? 

The unfair practices described in Q9 above may discourage or inhibit (potential) competitors 
and  business-users  from  competing  on  the  merits  and  may  thus  have  negative  effects  on 
competition, innovation, and consumers’ choice.  

15 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

Potential  unilateral  anticompetitive  conduct  may  take  place  within  the  same  set  of  goods 
and/or  services,  through  foreclosing  access  to  inputs/assets  or  users  or  by  leveraging  SIP 
into other goods and/or services.  

Digital services are driven by continuous and fast innovation. DPs with SIP may enable low 
transaction costs for innovators and thereby foster small-scale or incremental innovation that 
supports or complements their SIP. However, as discussed under Q9 above, DPs with SIP 
may also steer and impede innovation. Such potential harm to the competitive process and 
innovation might have a serious negative impact on business users and thereby reduce end-
users’ choice.  

A  DP  with  SIP  has  the  ability  and  may  have  the  incentive  to  exclude  or  impede  any 
disrupting innovation that endangers its position (see the conducts discussed in response to 
Q9  above).  By  foreclosing  competitors,  the  DP  with  SIP  could  reduce  its  own  incentive  to 
innovate  while  also  protecting  its  position  from  potentially  disruptive  innovation.  The  wider 
the geographic scope of the DP with SIP, the greater the potential impact on competition and 
innovation.  

Complementary services are not directly competing with the DP. For these services, it is less 
likely  that  they  will  undermine  the  DP’s  SIP  by  disruptive  innovation  and  backward 
integration.  Thus,  the  DP  with  SIP  does  not  have  the  same  incentive  to  foreclose  as  for 
(potentially) disruptive innovation. However, the DP with SIP may still engage in exclusionary 
conduct towards competing services if it decides to start supplying similar services itself or is 
already doing so. That may also relate to strategic information or data the DP with SIP has 
access  to.  Furthermore,  the  DP  with  SIP  has  the  ability  and  may  have  the  incentive  to 
engage in exploitative conduct towards complementary services (e.g. excessive pricing). For 
the  providers  of  complementary  services  that  are  exposed  to  the  SIP  of  the  DP,  such 
exploitative conduct may reduce their return on investment and, consequently, the incentive 
to innovate. This type of conduct could be applied both when the DP with SIP offers similar 
services, and when the DP with SIP merely serves as an intermediary.  

The  power  of a  DP  with  SIP to  act  independently  of  users  on  one  side of  a  platform might 
reinforce  its  ability  and  incentive  to  also  act  independently  on  the  other  side.  The  lack  of 
competitive  pressure  from  business  users  on  the  DP  with  SIP  may  allow  the  latter  to  set 
prices  or  terms  and  conditions  to  end-users  that  would  not  be  viable  in  a  competitive 
situation or vice versa – when end-users solely rely on the DP with SIP and business users 
must inevitably accept the terms and conditions set by the DP with SIP to access such end-
users.  

Question 13 (Section III; Emerging issues)  

Which are possible positive and negative societal (e.g. on freedom of expression, consumer 
protection, media plurality) and economic (e.g. on market contestability, innovation) effects, if 
any,  of  the  gatekeeper  role  that  large  online  platform  companies  exercise  over  whole 
platform ecosystem? 

For the economic effects of DPs with SIP, refer to the answers on questions Q10 and Q11 
above. 

16 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

DPs  are  active  in  different  parts  of  the  internet  value  chain  and  rely  on  a  well-functioning 
internet  ecosystem,  not  only  for  offering  their  own  services/products  but  also  for  the  end-
users consuming the offered services/products.  

BEREC and NRAs play an important role in ensuring this by protecting end-users’ rights and 
ensuring  the  uninterrupted  operation  of  the  internet  ecosystem  as  an  engine  of  innovation, 
e.g.  through  regulating  the  practices  of  ISPs  under  the  Open  Internet  Regulation.  As 
discussed  before,  DPs  with  SIP  can  also  control  access  to  significant  amount  of  data, 
content, services and information and this can result in positive and negative societal effects. 

Positive societal effects 

In  general,  DPs  contribute  to  the  ability  for  people  around  the  world  to  get  in  touch  and 
communicate  with  each  other  in  a  very  convenient  way  and  at  relatively  low  or  even  no 
additional  monetary  cost  (e.g.  social  media  platforms).  Furthermore,  DPs  have  made  it 
easier to access information (e.g. by collecting online reviews and/or offering search engines 
etc.)  which,  when  provided  in  a  transparent  manner,  have  empowered  end-users  and 
allowed them to make better-informed choices. DPs have also made it possible for SMEs to 
sell  their  products  and/or  services  on  these  platforms.  When  the  DP  incorporates  a  more 
extensive offer and a fair ranking system to assist in finding products/services, these SMEs 
can reach a large number of end-users, thus reducing the search costs of end-users. 

Finally,  DPs  have  had  a  profound  effect  on  digital  engagement,  media  industry  and 
facilitating access to digital content.  

Negative societal effects 

the  services/content/products  available 

Some  DPs  (e.g.  OSs,  app  stores,  voice  assistants)  have  become  important  gateways  to 
access and provide services/products on the internet. They have the ability to choose and/or 
the  closed  environment  (or 
influence  (i) 
ecosystem)  they  control,  and  (ii)  which  functionalities  (e.g.  APIs)  are  available  to  business 
users  on  their  platform  and  under  which  conditions.  If  this  is  done  based  on  unfair  or 
unreasonable conditions in an environment (or ecosystem) serving a large number of users 
and  encompassing  access  to  a  variety  of  services  across  multiple  AoBs,  the  control 
exercised  can  be  used  in  a  way  that  negatively  affects  consumer  choice,  freedom  of 
expression and media plurality. This is also the case for ranking interfaces and algorithms, 
as these act as nudging instruments for which information is shown to end-users at all and/or 
in which order.  

in 

Moreover, excessive data collection beyond what is allowed by GDPR, can have a negative 
effect on consumer protection when combined with unclear and non-transparent terms and 
conditions on how this data is collected, combined and used. Especially since data is used 
by certain DPs with SIP as a means of (cross-)subsidising their services.

Regulation  of 
gatekeepers 

large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 

Question  1  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Do  you  believe  that  in  order  to  address  any  negative  societal  and  economic  effects  of  the 
gatekeeper  role  that  large  online  platform  companies  exercise  over  whole  platform 
ecosystems, there is a need to consider dedicated regulatory rules? 

We fully agree  

Question  2  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Please explain 

DPs  with  SIP  play  an  increasingly  influential  role  in  the  digital  environment,  and  some 
structural  features  they  possess  and/or  unfair  practices  they  may  engage  in  could  raise 
economic and societal concerns that need to be addressed.  

BEREC  considers  that  a  dedicated  regulatory  framework  for  DPs  with  SIP  built  on  some 
important  similarities  with  the  ex-ante  approach  and  expertise  gained  in  the  ECS  sector 
could  address  such  issues.  There  are  several  reasons  to  prefer  a  dedicated  ex-ante 
regulatory framework.  

First of all, some of the identified concerns result from structural features, which should be 
addressed independently of any potentially abusive behaviour by DPs with SIP. In this case, 
the  application  of  ex-ante  dedicated  rules  is  well-suited.  For  instance,  the  control  over  a 
digital  bottleneck  and  the  resulting  control  over  over  essential  inputs/assets  provides  DPs 
with  SIP’s  with  a  significant  competitive  advantage  which  could  negatively  affect  inter-  and 
intra-platform  (or  ecosystem)  competition.  In  some  circumstances,  conditions  for  effective 
competition need to be created, or at least facilitated, in order to achieve efficient outcomes. 
Ex-ante  regulatory  frameworks  have  proven  to  be  efficient  to  foster  competition  and 
contestability.  

Moreover,  an  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  is  better-suited  to  pursue  a  variety  of  different 
objectives which have a positive impact on users and society at large. Along with fostering 
competition,  multiple  objectives  –  such  as  supporting  an  open  internet  or  achieving  the 
European  internal  market  –,  could  be  pursued  within  a  specific  regulatory  framework,  thus 
ensuring a more comprehensive and consistent intervention. 

Secondly,  the  difficulties  in  effectively  applying  current  ex-post  analytical  framework  and 
enforcement tools  call for  a  different  approach.  A  streamlined  ex-ante  intervention  appears 
to  be  more  efficient  for  consistently  solving  structural  problems  in  fast-moving  digital 
environments.  

Finally,  an  ex-ante  intervention  within  a  regulatory  framework  would  also  imply  repeated 
interactions  with  DPs  with  SIP  and  other  stakeholders  (business  users,  other  relevant 
authorities, consumer associations, civil society representatives ...), allowing for an effective 

18 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

definition, implementation and monitoring of remedies, as well as for regulatory adjustments 
according to relevant developments. 

To  take  account  of  DP  heterogeneity,  but  still  quickly  address  the  concerns,  BEREC 
supports a combined approach including principle-based obligations and prohibitions, as well 
as tailored remedies applied on a case-by-case basis (respectively, option 3a and 3b of the 
DSA inception impact assessment).  

The  general  obligations  and  prohibitions  would  be  applicable  to  all  DPs  with  SIP,  and 
adjusted to the characteristics of the each AoBs in order to be effective. The case-by-case 
remedies  would  be  applied  according  to  a  specific  assessment,  and  in  a  proportionate 
manner. 

The chart here below presents BEREC’s regulatory model.

BoR (20) 138 

Question  3  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers) 

Do  you  believe  that  such  dedicated  rules  should  prohibit  certain  practices  by  large  online 
platform  companies  with  gatekeeper  role  that  are  considered  particularly  harmful  for  users 
and consumers of these large online platforms? 

Yes.  

Question  4  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Please explain your reply and, if possible, detail the types of prohibitions that should in your 
view be part of the regulatory toolbox. 

Timely  actions,  as  well  as  flexibility  of  the  intervention,  are  crucial  in  order  to  be  effective. 
DPs  are  fast-moving,  innovative  businesses  that  are  constantly  evolving  over  time.  These 
characteristics  require  a  regulatory  framework  which  is  quick  and  flexible:  it  should  be 
adjustable  to  the  business  model,  characteristics  and  conduct  of  each  DP  with  SIP  that  is 
regulated, but should also adapt over time as well. 

On their  own,  predefined  obligations  and/or  prohibitions  might  be too  inflexible  to meet  the 
heterogeneity of platform businesses and might risk over- or under-regulation. However, an 
intervention  with  sole  case-by-case  remedies  might  be  quite  time-consuming  in  the  fast-
moving digital environment.  

Thus, BEREC proposes a combined approach of clearly defined principle-based prohibitions 
and  obligations  (See  Q6  below),  as  well  as  complementary  case-by-case  remedies  (See 
Q10 below).  

As  for  the  prohibitions,  BEREC  believes  that  a  principle-based  prohibition  to  unfairly 
discriminate among business users should be imposed on all DPs with SIP. 

Similarly  to  the  principle-based  obligation  (see  Q6  below),  such  a  prohibitions  should  be 
principle-based,  and  -  in  order to  be  effective -  should  be  adjusted to  the  characteristics  of 
the  specific  AoB  and  may  need  further  specification  and  adaptations  according  to  the 
context.  

The  same  would  be  true  for  how  these  rules  are  applied  and  enforced  in  practice.  An 
example  hereof  from  the  ECS  sector  is  the  prohibition  for  ISPs  to  technically  discriminate 
between  internet  traffic  with  no  objective  reason  (Open  Internet  Regulation).  These 
prohibitions are applied to all ISPs, but enforced in a tailored manner.  

Enforcement  is  a  key  and  complex  issue.  One  example  from  BEREC’s  experience  in  the 
ECS  sector  is  in  determining  whether  differences  in  treatment  may  be  objectively  justified. 
This  is  why  clear  principles  on  how  and  when  certain  prohibitions  should  be  applied  are 
necessary, which is especially important given that DPs are even more heterogeneous than 
ECS providers (see also Q24 below - Regulation of large online platform companies acting 
as gatekeepers). 

20 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

As  discussed  in  Q10  below,  remedies  imposed  on  a  case-by-case  basis  may  also  be 
imposed on DPs with SIP, if deemed necessary to address the identified concerns (Q9 and 
Q13  above  –  Emerging  issues).  All  interventions  would  need  to  be  proportionate.  In  this 
context,  case-by-case  assessment  is  important  in  order  to  ensure  that  regulation  is 
proportionate.  As  usual,  due  care  should  be  taken  not  to  disproportionately  reduce  the 
incentives to compete, internalise efficiencies, invest or innovate (for DPs with SIP and new 
entrants).  

Question  5  Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Do you believe that such dedicated rules should include obligations on large online platform 
companies with gatekeeper role? 

Yes. 

Question  6  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Please explain your reply and, if possible, detail the types of obligations that should in your 
view be part of the regulatory toolbox. 

BEREC  considers  that  both  principle-based  obligations  and  case-by-case  remedies  should 
be  part  of  the  regulatory  toolbox.  The  principle-based  ex-ante  obligations  should  be  less 
intrusive  as  tailor-made  remedies  applied  on  a  case-by-case  basis  (see  answer  to  Q10 
below). These general obligations would be imposed on all DPs with SIP and could include 
obligations  on  transparency,  which  would  require  the  DP  with  SIP  to  make  specific 
information easily available.  

Such  obligations  would  aim  at  achieving  transparency  towards  regulatory  authorities, 
business users and end-users. Moreover, the availability of information may also discourage 
the DP with SIP from engaging in abusive behaviours or, at least, make these more easily 
detectable.  

A  transparency  obligation  aimed  at  business  users  could  for  example  require  terms  and 
conditions to be easily understandable, unambiguous and complete.  

If  it  is  combined  with  an  access  and/or  interoperability  remedy  (See  Q10  below),  it  could 
contain provisions to enable access and/or interoperability, such as technical specifications 
and expected developments. In addition to that, it could be explored whether in some cases, 
e.g.  when  transparency  obligation  is  coupled  with  access  remedy,  some  parts  of  the  DP 
terms  and  conditions,  or  at  least  their  amendments,  may  be  approved  by  the  competent 
regulatory body.  

A transparency remedy could also include a description of which end-user data is collected 
and  how  it  is  used.  There  are  two  goals  with  this  remedy.  The  first  is  to  enable  business 
users to more efficiently use a data access remedy. The second is to empower end-users, 
supporting one of the pillars mentioned in the European Data Strategy (COM(2020)66 final), 
that could be further explored in the context of the Data Act.

Similarly to principle-based prohibitions, BEREC would like to emphasize that, in order to be 
effective, principle-based obligations should be adjusted to the characteristics of the specific 
AoB where the relevant DP with SIP is active.  

Question  7  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

If  you  consider  that  there  is  a  need  for  such  dedicated  rules  setting  prohibitions  and 
obligations,  as  those  referred  to  in  your  replies  to  questions  3  and  5  above,  do  you  think 
there is a need for a specific regulatory authority to enforce these rules? 

Yes.  

Question  8  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Please explain your reply 

The  following  institutional  model  could  be  seen  as  a  possible  option.  In  any  case,  BEREC 
believes  that  the  proposed  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  (SIP  assessment  and  dedicated 
rules and remedies) could be well-suited to address the identified concerns, independently of 
the institutional design of the intervention. 

The  experience  with  ECS  ex-ante  regulation  shows  how  useful  it  is  to  have  a  detailed 
regulatory framework that is applied across the EU. The existence of dedicated rules could 
facilitate  a  consistent  application  of  regulatory  solutions.  This  would  reduce  regulatory 
fragmentation and encourage EU-level competition between DPs among other things.  

There are number of important features which any regulatory authority with responsibility for 
regulating DPs with SIP should benefit from. Regulatory authorities at all levels should have 
relevant  expertise  in  relation  to  ex-ante  regulation,  i.e.  experience  in  monitoring  and 
analysing  markets,  enforcement  and  refinement  of  remedies  and  benefitting  from  multiple 
perspectives  (technical,  economic,  legal,  accounting  and  consumer  rights).  Besides, 
regulatory authorities would need to be able to study a wide range of domains in which DPs 
operate and have a deep technical understanding of digital environments. 

A regulatory authority should be independent (i.e. “independent of short-term political cycles, 
industry  as  well  as  other  stakeholders’  pressures”9).  This  is  the  cornerstone  in  ex-  ante 
economic  regulation,  aiming  at  ensuring  the  necessary  stability  of  the  regulation  and  an 
efficient intervention in the markets.  

BEREC  considers  that  the  geographical  scope  of  the  DP  with  SIP  is  relevant  in  order  to 
determine which regulatory body is involved in decision making on tailor-made remedies, as 
well as the enforcement of regulatory measures.  

The majority of large DPs offers its services in multiple countries at a pan-EU scale, i.e. by 
being present in more than 3 Member States (MSs) (level 1). A minority may be active in a 

9 BEREC statement on the independence of the national regulatory authorities, BoR (20) 141 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                
BoR (20) 138 

few, say 2 or 3 MSs (level 2), while other DPs may only operate in 1 MS (level 3). Each level 
requires a different approach. While BEREC assumes that the majority of issues will occur at 
level 1, serious concerns may also arise in relation to DPs with SIP operating only in 2 to 3 
MSs  or  just  at  national  level.  This  could  e.g.  concern  specialized  B2B  supplier-platforms 
targeting  SME  manufacturers,  comparative  platforms  offering  telecommunication  or  energy 
contracts  to  consumers,  specialized  e-commerce  platforms  as  well  as  real  estate 
intermediaries that are usually operating at a national level. In addition, while expanding to a 
regional or pan-EU level, DPs with SIP initially focusing on a national scope may stick in the 
markets they serve to a differentiated national approach. 

Similar to the approach used in ex-ante ECS regulation, BEREC considers that – also in line 
with  jurisdiction  rules  applicable  to  competition  matters  –  the  jurisdiction  should  be 
determined  based  on  the  place  of  provision  of  the  intermediation  service  regardless  of 
whether  the  DP  with  SIP  involved  is  established  in  a  MS  or  outside  the  EU.  This  principle 
would also apply in order to determine the jurisdiction within the EU. 

For  level-1  cases  (pan-EU),  BEREC  believes  that  determining  case-by-case  remedies,  as 
well as checking compliance with the applicable rules (enforcement), would be best handled 
by an EU Regulatory Body (EURB), which should preferably be based on an already existing 
authority  -  e.g.  the  European  Commission  -,  to  benefit  from  its  valuable  experience.  This 
would also allow for a faster set-up of the regulatory body.  

This  EURB  should  take  its  decisions  in  consultation  with  an  independent  Advisory  Body 
(AB), composed of competent National Regulatory Bodies (NRBs). The AB has an important 
role  to  play,  as  it  would  serve  as  a  forum  for  exchanging  best  practices  facilitating 
cooperation  between  NRBs  and  also  acting  as  a  coordinator  between  the  NRBs  and  the 
EURB.  The  existing  well-functioning  collaboration  in  the  field  of  ECS  amongst  expert 
practitioners from the  NRAs  on  the  one  hand  and  between the  European  Commission  and 
BEREC on the other may serve as a good example for such a cooperation model.  

BEREC considers it should be up to the MSs to nominate a competent national authority to 
function  as  the  NRB.  This  could  either  imply  creating  a  new  authority  or  granting  new 
competences to an existing authority.  

A  well-functioning  cooperative  model  under  the  umbrella  of  the  AB  is  key.  Therefore,  it  is 
important  to  point  out  that  the  above-mentioned  common  set  of  competences  for  NRBs  is 
necessary  to  allow  for  a  successful  coordination  at  the  European  level.  The  BEREC 
cooperation framework is a good-functioning reference model.  

In order to lower the regulatory burden for the EURB, it is important to predefine cases and 
regulatory  tasks  without  pan  EU-implications,  which  could  be  directly  addressed  by  the 
competent  NRB,  following  the  subsidiarity  principle  as  would  be  the  case  for  pure  national 
cases or disputes with national actors not affecting pan-EU regulation. In such cases, the AB 
could  play  a  role  in  identifying  the  level  at  which  the  issue  occurs,  in  coordination  with  the 
NRBs  and  the  EURB.  Although  DPs  may  be  active  in  multiple  MSs,  these  issues  may  not 
necessarily  occur  (to  the  same  extent)  in  each  of  these  MSs.  Therefore,  the  level  should 
actually be determined based on the number of MSs in which the issue occurs.

See further Q12 below. 

Question  9  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers) 

Do  you  believe  that  such  dedicated  rules  should  enable  regulatory  intervention  against 
specific  large  online  platform  companies,  when  necessary,  with  a  case  by  case  adapted 
remedies? 

Yes 

Question  10  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

If yes, please explain your reply and, if possible, detail the types of case by case remedies. 

BEREC  has  considerable  hands-on  experience  in  applying  case-by-case  tailored remedies 
to SMP operators in the ECS sector.  

Building on this experience, BEREC believes that remedies should be proportionate and the 
least intrusive should be applied first. Moreover, regulators must be mindful of the impact of 
the overall regulatory burden on incentives to innovate.  

Proportionality requires that when different DPs raise different structural problems for market 
entry,  competition,  investment  and  end-users’  rights,  this  should  be  taken  into  account  in 
remedy design and enforcement. Remedies can also differ among AoB, or according to the 
regulatory (economic or social) objectives to be pursued. 

Remedies  to  be  applied  on  a  case-by-case  basis  could  include  e.g.  access  and 
interoperability obligations.  

Concerning  the  access  to  key  inputs  (e.g.  data)  or  assets  (e.g.  technical  functionalities), 
proportionate access remedies could require the DP with SIP to make (part of) their services 
their  application 
interoperable,  either  by  opening,  without  unjustified 
programming interfaces (APIs), or by imposing the use of open standards. By accessing key 
inputs  or  assets,  business  users  could  provide  competing  or  complementary 
services/products to end-users.  

restrictions, 

Disproportionate  and/or  strategical  denial  of  access  to  the  digital  environment  that  the  DP 
with  SIP  is  offering  could  negatively  affect  both  business  users  (who  could  not  reach  end-
users  without  access  to  the  DP  with  SIP’s  environment)  and  consumers  (e.g.  denial  of 
access  to  reach  or  share  services/content/good).  Access  remedies  could  enhance 
competition, growth and innovation over several AoB (e.g. by creating a level-playing field for 
business  users),  thereby  increasing  end-users’  choice,  and  the  ability  to  communicate 
without unjustified interference.  

In  addition  to  that,  ensuring  user-friendly  data  portability  procedures  might  be  a  good 
solution  for  increasing  the  ability  of  consumers  to  switch  providers  while  keeping  their 
valuable  data.  In  order  to  make  such  procedures  easily  accessible  and  operational,  highly 
technical regulation shaped and enforced by ex-ante regulators might be necessary.

BoR (20) 138 

Finally, BEREC also believes that the regulatory toolbox should be complemented with tools 
aimed at enhancing information gathering and sharing with stakeholders, in compliance with 
data  protection  legislation  and  business  confidentiality.  By  applying  to  the  supervision  and 
enforcement  regulatory  tools  mentioned  in  Q24  below  and  Q4  on  Governance  of  digital 
services and aspects of enforcement, in compliance with GDPR, the forthcoming Data Act, 
and  business  confidentiality,  the  regulatory  body  could  make  relevant  information  provided 
by the DP with SIP, business users or other stakeholders easily available. Provided as open 
data,  in  a  user-friendly  format  if  possible,  such  information  could  help  users  make  better-
informed choices and guide, raise users’ awareness and transparency. 

Question  11  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

If  you  consider  that  there  is  a  need  for  such  dedicated  rules,  as  referred  to  in  question  9 
above, do you think there is a need for a specific regulatory authority to enforce these rules? 

Yes 

Question  12  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Please explain your reply 

In level 2 cases, the NRB of the MS in which the issue primarily occurs should notify all of its 
EU  counterparts  (through  the  AB)  while  inviting  NRBs  of  other  impacted  MSs  to  formally 
engage in the decision-making process.  

Subsequently, a Joint Team (JT) could be put together, composed of staff of the concerned 
NRBs – taking into account their resource capacity. The initiating NRB may take the lead in 
setting  up  the  JT  and  coordinating  its  activities.  All  involved  NRBs  need  to  reach  a 
consensus  expressed  as  "joint  principles"  in  line  with  the  common  approach  applied  at the 
EU  level,  which  should  be  transposed  into  the  respective  individual  decisions  of  each 
involved  NRB,  taking  into  account  local  particularities.  This  would  allow  for  adjusted 
decision-making  and  enforcement  at  the  national  level.  Since  level  2  cases  transcend 
national  interests  and  joint  principles  may serve as  a  precedent,  it  would  be  appropriate  to 
implement a double lock veto of the EURB and the AB for harmonization purposes, similar to 
what exists in the field of ECS.  

The double lock veto would e.g. pertain to questions related to: 

•  Whether a specific case needs to be considered at level 2 or rather at a pan-European 
level, which will determine how and by whom the case should be handled. This would in 
principle already be done at the beginning of the process (predefined case, see last § of 
Q8), but could have evolved since then. 

•  Whether  or  not  “joint  principles”  issued  by  a  JT  are  in  line  with  the  common  approach 
determined at pan-European level. If not, the EURB and the AB could request the JT to 
revise their “joint principles” accordingly. 

At level 3 (national level), decision-making is in the hands of the concerned NRB. However, 
the NRB is required to notify the EURB and the AB of its draft decision (similar to the arts. 32 

25 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

and 33 EECC within the field of ECS). The EURB and the AB may e.g. judge that the case at 
hand is rather to be handled at level 1 or level 2. The NRB should take utmost account of the 
EURB’s and AB’s opinion.  

NRBs  are  arguably  well-placed  to  (pro)actively  monitor  the  evolution  of  DPs  within  their 
AoBs  in  their  respective  national  footprints  and  contribute  to  common  positions  and 
guidelines.  NRBs  may  (co-)  engage  in  the  resolution  of  (local)  disputes.  Both  types  of 
activities should be coordinated by the AB. With reference to Q8 above, BEREC considers 
that a key requirement for success is the common set of competences NRBs should have.  

The cooperation between NRAs under the coordination of BEREC can serve as a reference, 
which  has  proven  successful  in  the  field  of  ECS.  In  this  respect,  BEREC  points  out  that 
among  other  contributions  the  many  BEREC  Common  Positions  and  Guidelines,  the 
implementation  of  arts.  32  and  33  EECC  procedure  and,  not  in  the  least,  the  work  and 
investigations  made  by  every-day  practitioners  that  are  close  to  the  activities  and  subject 
matter  at  hand,  has  enabled  an  efficient and consistent  application  of  ex-ante regulation  in 
the field of ECS. 

In order to also ensure a consistent application of ex-ante regulation towards DPs with SIP, 
BEREC and its member NRAs are in a good position to effectively take on the roles of AB 
and  NRBs  respectively.  This  governance  model  would  have  the  advantage  of  benefitting 
from their valuable ex-ante experience and structure and of allowing for a faster institutional 
set-up.  In  this  case,  NRAs  should  ensure  to  extend  their  (technical)  capabilities  onto  the 
wide variety of (digital) AoBs in which DPs operate.  

As  to  the  question  at  what  level  the  regulatory  oversight  of  DPs  with  SIP  should  be 
organised (Q14 below) does not allow for nuancing, BEREC prefers to clarify its answer (i.e. 
“Both at EU and national level”) below. 

As for the optional identification of targeted DPs with SIP, this could be done for  

• 

• 
• 

level 1 by the EURB (based on information to be provided by NRBs among other 
sources), though a prior consultation should take place with the AB; 
level 2 by the JT of NRBs; 
level 3 by the NRB.  

The  respective  bodies  identified  above  should  in  general  also  be  competent  for  decision-
making on case-by-case remedies within these levels and could carry out the enforcement of 
the principle-based and tailored remedies. However, in line with which was mentioned at the 
end  of  Q8,  enforcement  on  remedies  for  level-1  cases  could,  to  the  extent  possible,  be 
directly  addressed  by  the  competent  NRB,  following  the  subsidiarity  principle.  This  could 
have the advantage of being more efficient and effective. In this regard, the application of the 
EU roaming regulation, as well the Open internet regulation, might serve as a good example. 

General  periodical  data  collection  (as  preparing  clearly  defined  statistics  or  reports  or 
studies)  from  important  DPs  with  or  without  SIP  should  take  place  both  at  NRB  and  at 
EURB-level, taking into account the proportionality principle. The AB should coordinate the 
data collections, by providing templates and definitions that are applied in all MSs, aggregate 
at  the  EU  level  data  collected  at  national  level,  e.g.  as  done  by  BEREC  for  international

roaming  data.10  Some  of  this  information  could  be  made  public,  respecting  confidentiality 
rules. Obviously specific ad hoc information gathered from DPs with SIP related to specific 
concerns/conduct should not be made publicly available. 

For clarification purposes, we summarise our proposal in the following table.

Question  13  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

If  you  consider  that  there  is  a  need  for  a  specific  regulatory  authority  to  enforce  dedicated 
rules referred to questions 3, 5 and 9 respectively, would in your view these rules need to be 
enforced by the same regulatory authority or could they be enforced by different regulatory 
authorities? Please explain your reply. 

BEREC considers that even though these are different types of enforcement, the underlying 
principles are the same, which justifies that the same regulatory body should be responsible 
in  both  cases.  In  this  respect,  BEREC  refers  to  the  experience  in  the  field  of  ECS  where 
NRAs  are  effectively  responsible  for  both  types  of  enforcement  in  the  application  of  the 
European ECS Framework (e.g. regarding end-users’ rights/numbering/general authorisation 

10 See for example “International Roaming BEREC Benchmark Data Report October 2018 – March 2019” (BoR

(general  prohibitions/obligations)  but  also  regarding  the  surveillance  of  national  SMP 
operators (case-by-case basis). 

This would also allow taking advantage of the resulting synergies and thus have a positive 
impact  on  the  length  of  proceedings.  In  the  same  vein,  in  case  two  different  regulatory 
bodies  were  competent,  there  would  be  a  risk  of  overlapping  regulation  and/or  a  need  to 
coordinate. 

In  any  case,  as  explained  in  the  reply  to  Q2  on  Regulation  of  large  online  platform 
companies  acting  as  gatekeepers,  BEREC  considers  that  the  competent  regulatory  body 
should  be  determined  depending  on  whether  the  case  at  hand  occurs  at  (i)  level  1  (more 
than  three  MS’  involved),  (ii)  level  2  (two  or  three  MS’  involved)  or  (iii)  level  3  (national 
impact only). In general, the EURB would be responsible for level-1 cases (with the option to 
delegate  the  enforcement  to  the  NRBs  on  a  case-by-case  basis),  while  the  JT  of  NRBs 
would be involved in level-2 cases and the respective NRBs for level-3 cases. 

Question  14  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers) 

At what level should the regulatory oversight of platforms be organized? 

  At national level 

  At EU level 

X Both at EU and national level. 

I don't know  

Question  15  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers) 

If you consider such dedicated rules necessary, what should in your view be the relationship 
of such rules with the existing sector specific rules and/or any future sector specific rules? 

Due  to  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  DPs  and  depending  on  the  platform's  activity  and  its 
impact on the functioning of other markets, DP regulators will undoubtedly have to take into 
account specific EU regulations that apply in various market sectors.  

BEREC also considers that privacy rules have a clear and important economic impact within 
the  digital  environment.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  GDPR  is  essentially  based  on 
fundament  rights  of  individuals  and  not  designed  to  solve  economic  issues.  Nonetheless, 
remedies  should  take  account  of  other  existing  EU  regulations  with  respect  to  the  digital 
landscape in order to ensure legal certainty.  

In  addition  to  this,  it  is  also  expected  that  the  DSA  Package  will  outline  cooperation 
mechanisms with other authorities coping with digital ecosystems. The EURB, AB and NRBs 
should in any case coordinate their activities with other authorities responsible for defining or 
implementing  sector  specific rules,  insofar  as  the  respective rules might affect  one  another 
and insofar as the respective laws allow for such coordination. Providing for the possibility of 
cooperation  between  the  AB  and  similar  bodies  or  groups  associating  or  coordinating 

28 

 
 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

national  bodies  with  other  competences  (e.g.  ERGA  or  EDPB)  also  seems  worth 
considering. 

Regulatory  flexibility  will  be  important,  especially  in  regards  to  level  2  and  level  3  cases, 
whilst  at the  same  it  will  be  necessary to  avoid  regulatory  uncertainty.  A rigid  stipulation  of 
regulations  which  may  be  in  conflict  with  measures  stemming from  the  DSA  Package may 
raise  problems  when  regulating  platforms  with  business  profiles  that  were  not  foreseen  by 
lawmakers. Also, with regards to the model of coordination of regulatory activities at national 
level,  MSs  should  be  in  a  position  to  allocate  competences  to  the  relevant  bodies. 
Regulators responsible for individual sectors already exist, as well as those whose authority 
is not restricted to one sector.  

Cross-sectorial cooperation between institutions at both national and European level should 
be envisaged at all stages of proceedings to determine the remedies to be imposed on the 
DPs with SIP and also their enforcement and monitoring. While monitoring the effectiveness 
of  established  regulatory  intervention,  the  ability  to  consult  on  observed  behaviour  of  DPs 
with SIP with bodies which have different competences and legal perspectives may help to 
decide whether it is necessary to maintain, amend or repeal imposed remedies. 

Question  16  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Should such rules have an objective to tackle both negative societal and negative economic 
effects  deriving  from  the  gatekeeper  role  of  these  very  large  online  platforms?  Please 
explain your reply. 

Many  different  features  in  the  digital  environment  (see  Q2  on  Main  features  of  gatekeeper 
online  platform  companies)  can  raise  both  economic  and  societal  concerns  (see  Q11  and 
Q13  on  Emerging  issues).  Based  on  the  experience  in  regulating  ECS,  BEREC  considers 
that the proposed rules can and should have the objective to address both types of effects.  

The ex-ante experience in the ECS sector, aimed to reach a variety of objectives, shows that 
society  can  benefit  from  a  holistic  approach.  In  many  cases,  regulatory  tools  are  used  to 
reach several different objectives. For example, the EECC aims to cover several objectives, 
such as the development of the internal market, protection of end-users’ rights, competition, 
deployment and take-up of VHCN and end-to-end connectivity.  

In  applying  an  ex-ante  regulatory  toolbox,  NRAs  have  experience  in  using  targeted 
regulation to achieve multiple effects. One example is number portability, which encourages 
competition, while at the same time, benefits consumers. BEREC thinks that this approach 
could be also applied to ex-ante regulation of DPs with SIP. In addition, it can sometimes be 
difficult  to  disentangle  effects  of  a  precise  structural  or  specific  societal  feature.  As  an 
example,  ensuring  internet  openness,  an  objective  in  the  scope  of  the  ECS  regulatory 
framework,  has  both  economic  (i.e.  on  competition  dynamics)  and  societal  (i.e. freedom  of 
choice,  accessibility  of  public  services,  social  inclusion  or  freedom  of  expression) 
implications.  

When  transposed  to  the  digital  environment,  certain  DPs  with  SIP  may  de  facto  act  as  a 
bottleneck for access and distribution of content and applications, however the upper parts 
for  accessing  content  and 
the  network 
of 

the  value  chain  (i.e.  beyond 

layer) 

29

services/applications are not in the regulatory scope of the EECC. It is important to monitor 
this part of the value chain regarding potential threats to the open use of the Internet and its 
applications in the near future.  

A holistic approach is also relevant for the data-intensive business models of some DP with 
SIP.  Disproportionate  data  collection  might  be  a  signal  of  weak  competition,  especially  in 
business  models  where  no  monetary  price  is  paid  for  the  service.  Therefore,  ex-ante 
remedies  aimed  at  increasing  competition  -  such  as,  for  example,  data  portability  or 
interoperability  - might  in  some  cases  help  to  increase  end-users’  protection.  By  promoting 
the development of consumer-empowering tools, ex-ante regulations might do both: protect 
consumers  and  enhance  competition.  Therefore,  BEREC  believes  that  considering  the 
holistic  impact  of  DPs  with  SIP  in  the  digital  environment,  the  data-intensive  business 
models used in this domain and the essential nature of some of the services they offer, ex-
ante  rules  should  consider  the  externalities  between  different  objectives  of  public  interest 
(competition, internet openness, end-users’ rights, data protection) to be pursued. 

Question  19  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Which, if any, of the following characteristics are relevant when considering the requirements 
for  a  potential regulatory  authority  overseeing  the  large  online  platform companies  with  the 
gatekeeper role: 

X  Institutional  cooperation  with  other  authorities  addressing  related  sectors  –  e.  g. 
competition  authorities,  data  protection  authorities,  financial  services  authorities,  consumer 
protection authorities, cyber security, etc. 

X Pan-EU scope 

X Swift and effective cross-border cooperation and assistance across Member States 

X Capacity building within Member States 

X High level of technical capabilities including data processing, auditing capacities 

X Cooperation with extra-EU jurisdictions  

X Other  

Question  20  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

If other, please specify? 

All the characteristics above are relevant.  

Firstly,  institutional  cooperation  between  the  EURB/NRB  and  competition  authorities  would 
be  required.  The  current  cooperation  scheme  between  NRAs  and  competition  authorities 
can  be  considered  as  a good reference.  Moreover, the  complexity  and  variety  of  concerns 
related  to  DPs  requires  the  adoption  of  a  holistic  approach.  Hence,  the  establishment  of 
collaboration channels (i.e. information flows, periodical meetings etc.) with other authorities 
would  be  positive  for  the  consistency  and  effectiveness  of  DPs  with  SIP  regulation.  This 

30 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

should not be restricted to competition authorities, but also to any other regulatory authority 
applying regulations that may overlap with the regulatory framework for DPs with SIP.  

For instance, if the regulatory body for DPs imposes any data sharing obligation, provisions 
in the GDPR should be an element to be taken into account and coordinated with the data 
protection  authorities  (DPAs).  In  the  ECS  regulation,  as  a  way  of  example,  the  EECC 
encourages  collaboration  among  different  competent  authorities  about  issues  such  as  (i) 
promotion of lawful content in ECN and services (art. 24.3); (ii) co-location and sharing of the 
network elements (art. 44.1); (iii) monitoring of retail tariffs within the scope of US obligations 
(art.  85.1);  (iv)  price  comparisons  for  general  users  (art.  103);  or  (v)  quality  of  service  (art. 
104).  

In  general,  competition  concerns  and  societal  issues  related  to  DPs  with  SIP  are  often 
similar  across  EU.  In  consequence,  a pan-EU scope  would  in  most  cases  be  adequate for 
the regulatory body. However, there could be some areas where national-level enforcement 
of these measures is preferable (See answer Q12 above).  

Swift and effective cross-border cooperation and assistance across MSs is crucial to ensure 
consistent  and  effective  enforcement,  and  also  to  detect  potential  competition  concerns.  In 
this regard, the role of an AB can be very important. BEREC, with its role in ECS regulation 
across  EU,  provides  a  tested  cooperation  model  that  ensures  a consistent  application  of  a 
regulatory framework. 

As discussed above, BEREC and its member NRAs are well placed to effectively take on the 
roles  of  AB  and  NRBs  respectively.  This  governance  model  would  have  the  advantage  of 
benefitting from their valuable ex ante-experience and structure and of allowing for a faster 
institutional set-up.  

As  DPs  are  rapidly  evolving,  any  regulatory  body  in  charge  of  DPs  regulation  should  be 
highly  flexible  and  have  the  ability  to  adapt  to  new  contexts  and  circumstances. 
The experience  with  ongoing  market  monitoring  and  the  enforcement  of  ex-ante  measures 
should be considered when selecting a potential regulatory body. Furthermore, both capacity 
building  within  MSs  and  the  development  of  high-level  technical  capabilities  are  also  key 
elements for carrying out the missions of a regulatory body in an efficient manner (see Q 24 
below), next to economic skills and legal expertise.  

Question  21  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Please explain if these characteristics would need to be different depending on the type of 
ex ante rules (see questions 3, 5, 9 above) that the regulatory authority would be enforcing? 

These characteristics would in general be similar, regardless the adoption of a model based 
on  principle  based  dedicated  rules,  a  case-by-case  scheme  or  a  combination  of  these  two 
approaches. See BERECs answer to Q13 on Emerging issues, Q3 and Q5 on Regulation of 
large online platform companies acting as gatekeepers.

Other – please list 

As explained in Q24 below, BEREC considers that supervision and enforcement tools such 
as  information  requests  (with  a  corresponding  obligation  to  respond),  monitoring  and 
inspection  powers,  reporting  obligations  and  dispute  resolution,  can  be  suitable  to  ensure 
appropriate  regulation  of  DPs  with  SIP.  Such  measures  would  allow  the  responsible 
regulatory body to gather, publish and share (in compliance with legislation concerning data 
protection and business confidentiality) relevant information with stakeholders and users with 
the  aim  of  increasing  user  empowerment  and  adjusting  regulatory  measures,  where 
necessary  (data-driven  regulation,  see  Q10  above).  Moreover,  BEREC  believes  that  it  is 
important  to  combine  these  tools  with  the  complementary  legal  instruments  needed  to 
impose penalties in case of infringement of enforcement measures.  

Question  24  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers)  

Please explain if these requirements would need to be different depending on the type of ex 
ante rules (see questions 3, 5, 9 above) that the regulatory authority would be enforcing? 

Based  on  its  considerable  experience  regulating  the  ECS  sector,  which  shares  some  key 
structural  features  and  competition  concerns  with  DPs  with  SIP,  BEREC  considers  that 
supervision  and  enforcement  are  fundamental  to  correctly  assess  the  application  of  the 
combined  approach  of  principle-based  obligations/prohibitions  and  case-by-case  ex-ante 
remedies  on  DPs  with  SIP.  Moreover,  prior  to  imposing  any  case-by-case  remedy  on  DPs 
with SIP, it is important to monitor and understand the evolution in the use of these DPs by 
consumers  and  business  users  as  well  as  technical  and  economic  characteristics  shaping 
these  services.  This  allows  for  an  adequate  identification  of  economic  and  societal  issues 
arising and to design appropriate and proportionate remedies to address these concerns.  

The technical complexity of DPs, powered by highly-specialised technologies using big data, 
machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI),  constantly  expand  DPs’  data-driven 
capabilities,  enriching  their  insights  and  control  of  the  different  domains  covered  by  each 
platform  (or  its  ecosystem  where  applicable).  This  high-tech  environment  is  inherently 
associated  with  deep  information  asymmetries  between  DPs  and  users,  competitors  and 
public authorities. As a result, a highly technical regulatory body with significant powers and 

32 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

skills in terms of information acquisition, monitoring and inspection of DPs is required, similar 
to the regulatory toolbox applied in the ECS framework.  

Following  regulatory  intervention  principles  as  in  the  ECS  sector,  BEREC  considers  that 
supervision and enforcement tools such as information requests, monitoring, inspection and 
dispute resolution powers of regulatory bodies and reporting obligations applied to DPs with 
SIP, combined with complementary legal instruments needed to impose penalties in case of 
infringements,  are  important.  These  powers  could  be  clearly  established  in  the  legislative 
framework applicable to the DPs with SIP.  

However, the appropriate regulatory body/ies should adequately modulate its application by 
depending  on  various  aspects,  as  competition  concerns,  market  dynamics,  type  of 
stakeholders involved, end- and business-users’ interest and of ex-ante measures already in 
place,  in  order  to  avoid  an  ineffective,  excessive  or  inefficient  regulation.  Reporting 
obligations  to  collect  information  would  vary  depending  on  these  conditions.  Different 
measures could be implemented, such as specific reporting about updates to the terms and 
conditions to enhance transparency towards business users, or providing information about 
how and what type of data is collected and exploited, in order to empower end-users, as well 
as  relevant  supervisory-related  KPIs  reporting  (e.g.  denials  of  access  to  business  users, 
number  of  end-user/business  user  complaints).  The  experience  of  NRAs  applying 
supervision  and  monitoring  tools  in  the  ECS  sector  can  be  as  a  good  source  for  best 
practices for the regulatory framework towards DPs with SIP.  

Question  25  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as

Question  26  (Section  III;  Regulation  of  large  online  platform  companies  acting  as 
gatekeepers) 

Please explain which of the options, or combination of these, would be, in your view, suitable 
and sufficient to address the market issues arising in the online platforms ecosystems? 

BEREC believes that the most suitable model would be an additional regulatory framework 
setting  principle-based  obligations/prohibitions  for  DPs  with  SIP,  combined  with  possible 
specific tailor-made remedies based on case-by-case analysis (see also answers to Q4, 6, 
10 above), thus an efficient combination of option 2 and 3.  

BEREC favours this combined option because it calls for a regulatory framework which acts 
quickly and effectively rather than the mere enforcement of individual ex-ante measures. The 
ex-ante  regulatory  framework  has  historically  proven  to  be  very  effective  in  monitoring 
evolving  markets.  In  sectors  where  technical  complexity  and  innovation  is  very  strong,  the 
ability  to  continuously  share  information  between  regulators  and  relevant  players,  ensures 
flexibility and timely interventions. Moreover, ex-ante regulation has proven successful in the 
ECS  sector  in  achieving  potentially  conflicting  objectives  in  the  long  term,  such  as 
competition  on  prices  (static  efficiency)  and  high  levels  of  investment  (dynamic  efficiency). 
The ability to develop coherent and time-consistent regulatory schemes such as the “ladder 
of investment”, has allowed ECS markets to achieve both objectives in the long term. In the 
DP  environment,  a similar  ex-ante  approach  could  be  equally  effective.  Therefore,  BEREC 
favours  a  consistent  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  for  DPs.  Option  1  and  4  as  standalone 
options are not considered. 

As  also  explained  in  Q10  of  this  section,  different  DPs  may  raise  different  structural  and 
behavioral  problems  for  market  entry,  competition  and  investment.  This  might  especially 
differ  over  different  types  of  business.  Therefore,  general  principle-based  rules  should  be 
combined with tailor-made remedies for specific DPs with SIP.  

If  the  regulatory  proposals  formulated  by  BEREC  for  DPs  with  SIP  were  adopted,  BEREC 
considers that the NCT (option 4) should not overlap with this proposed ex-ante regulatory 
framework,  and  that  the  latter  should  be  the  applicable  legislation  (lex  specialis  principle). 
Like in the ECS sector, such a regulatory framework for DPs with SIP can be adapted in an 
efficient,  tailored  and  consistent  manner.  It  provides  a  scheme  for  predictable  and  timely 
intervention  to  address  the  identified  competition  problems,  while  creating  the  means  to 
pursue a variety of objectives, in order to also address wider societal concerns. For a more 
elaborative  view  on  the  NCT,  please  see  BEREC’s  position  paper  on  the  NCT  public 
consultation.

Question 4 (Section VI; Governance of digital services and aspects of enforcement) 

34 

 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

What  information  should  competent  authorities  make  publicly  available  about  their 
supervisory and enforcement activity? 

Publication of information resulting from supervision and enforcement activities towards DPs 
with SIP carried out by regulatory bodies at EU or/and national level is fundamental, both for 
transparency  purposes  regarding  regulatory  activity,  and  to  share  information  with  other 
sectorial-specific  competent  bodies  and  promote  a  common  regulatory  approach  to  foster 
the development of the European internal market.  

Based  on  the  experience  from  the  ECS  sector,  where  explicit  obligations  are  set  for 
publication  of  information  and  coordination  mechanisms  among  NRAs,  the  European 
Commission  and  agencies  (such  as  BEREC)  are  in  place,  a  similar  approach  could  be 
adopted in the regulatory framework for DPs. 

Aside from periodic reports at both national and EU level with key data (AoB, geographical 
area of service provision, number of unique users, etc.) about the DPs with SIP, publication 
of  regulatory  measures  and  transparency  about  disputes  resolution  cases  would  be  highly 
valuable.  This  information  sharing  would  increase  the  transparency  across  competent 
regulatory  bodies  in  the  EU,  helping  to  consolidate  the  internal  market  and  increase 
consumer  protection  throughout  the  EU.  Furthermore,  the  consultation  and  transparency 
mechanisms  set  out  in  the  ECS  regulatory  framework  prior  to  the  adoption  of  regulatory 
measures, could be considered a good practice applicable to the DP with SIP’s regulation. 

Besides  transparency  vis-à-vis  public  bodies,  asymmetry  of  information  between  DPs  and 
business  users  and  end-users  is  a  key  challenge.  To  tackle  this  information  asymmetry, 
notwithstanding  requirements  on  transparency  set  in  the  P2B  regulation  for  all  platforms11, 
BEREC  advocates  for  promoting  greater  transparency  for  DPs  with  SIP,  by  means  of 
information  gathering  and  sharing  with  business  users  and  end-users  about  the  terms  and 
conditions imposed (transparency obligation). By increasing their awareness about the type 
of data and use done by DPs with SIP, consumers can be empowered. Information sharing 
can  also  broaden  and  enhance  the  quality  and  innovation  of  the  services  offered  to  end-
users.  Fostering  data-driven  regulation  by  means  of  the  publication  of  data,  e.g.  providing 
comparison  tools,  as  well  as  the  publication  of  information  on  complaints,  best  practices 
guidelines  such  as complaint  and  redress mechanisms for  business  users  could  be  further 
considered.

2.  PUBLIC  CONSULTATION  ON  THE  NEW  COMPETITION 

TOOL 

Concerning  the  New  Competition  Tool  (NCT),  BEREC  provides  its  views  on  the  potential 
interplay  between  the  NCT  and  (i)  the  existing  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  for  electronic 
and  communication  services  (ECS)  and  (ii)  the  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  for  digital 
platforms (DPs) under the DSA Package.  

First of all, BEREC recognises that there may be a potential overlap with the established ex-
ante  regulation for  ECS. If this  is the  case,  BEREC  believes  that the  lex  specialis  principle 
should  be  followed  and  that  the  specific  regulatory  framework  should  be  the  applicable 
legislation.  

If implemented within an existing regulatory framework, the NCT could potentially serve as a 
complementary tool in exceptional cases not currently addressed by sectoral regulation. For 
instance,  market  investigations,  as  potentially  considered  under  the  NCT,  may  be  used  to 
gather relevant  knowledge  and  adapt future  regulation  in  a  harmonised and  coherent  way. 
However,  BEREC  believes  that  this  tool  would  be  more  efficient  if  carried  out  by  the 
competent regulatory authorities (potentially in cooperation with competition authorities), who 
have the relevant experience in the field.  

Secondly,  concerning  the  regulatory  intervention  towards  DPs,  BEREC  considers  that  the 
ex-ante  regulatory  framework  proposed  in  its  response  to  the  public  consultation  on  the 
Digital  Services  Act  (DSA)  Package  is  better  suited  to  address  structural  and  behavioural 
concerns  raised  by  DPs  with  Significant  Intermediation  Power  (SIP).  Moreover,  BEREC 
believes that this proposed regulatory framework is not interchangeable with the NCT, as the 
latter has a much broader scope than the ex-ante regulatory intervention considered in the 
DSA public consultation, even when the scope of the NCT is limited to digital services, which 
are in any case broader than DPs with SIP. Building on its expertise, BEREC believes that 
the  regulatory  framework  for  ECS  has  been  successful  because  a  well-defined  scope  and 
relevant  criteria  related  to  specific  markets  are  set  as  a  prerequisite  for  intervention.  This 
approach is more difficult to be applied by a general tool with a broader scope. 

(i) 

The interplay with the existing ex-ante regulatory framework for ECS 

The  regulatory  framework  for  ECS,  extensively  applied  over  the  last  twenty  years,  has 
proven  successful  in  addressing  structural  problems  and  enabling  a  competitive  and 
innovative ECS sector in Europe. For two decades, the framework has continued to evolve 
in order to address new concerns and regulation has been lifted in markets where it was no 
longer necessary.  

Furthermore,  this  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  –  including  the  European  Electronic 
Communications  Code  (EECC)  and  other  relevant  regulations,  such  as  those  on  Open 
Internet  and  on  Roaming  –,  is  also  successful  because  it  is  not  only  aimed  at  addressing 
structural competition issues, but also at reaching a variety of broader objectives (ensuring 
connectivity and internet openness, protecting end-users’ rights, and so on), that can neither 

36 

 
 
 
 
BoR (20) 138 

be sufficiently or appropriately treated by ex-post competition law, nor by ex-ante measures 
imposed outside of a coherent regulatory framework.  

In the ECS sector, the interplay between ex-ante regulation and ex-post competition law is 
well-defined.  One  of  the  conditions  for  imposing  asymmetric  regulation  on  operators  with 
significant  market  power  is  that  ex-post  competition  law  would  not  be  sufficient  to  address 
the identified competition problems.  

If the ECS sector were to fall within the scope of the NCT, then this complementarity would 
also  need  to  be  ensured.  A  conflict  between  ECS  regulation  and  the  NCT  could  result  in 
inconsistent application of ex-ante regulation, forum shopping by market actors and potential 
regulatory  uncertainty  on  whom,  how  and  under  which  circumstances  a  market  actor  is 
subject to regulation. This legal uncertainty could have serious implications for investment in 
a dynamic and competitive sector.  

For this reason, BEREC considers that, if the NCT is to be implemented including the ECS 
sector in its scope, the principle of lex specialis should apply, and the regulatory framework 
for  ECS  should  be  the  applicable  legislation.  This  implies  that  any  structural  issue  already 
considered  in  the  ECS framework  should  be  addressed  applying  this framework  only. This 
framework  is  specialised  for  the  ECS  sector,  allowing  for  a  comprehensive  and  consistent 
application  of  tailored  remedies,  reaching  a  variety  of  objectives,  setting  a  scheme  for 
interactions  with  stakeholders  and  providing  predictability  and  consistency  throughout  the 
EU.  

Furthermore, BEREC believes that, given its two-decade experience in the sector, regulatory 
authorities  for  the  ECS  sector  are  in  an  optimal  position  (as  they  are  already  doing  so)  to 
carry  out  an  analysis  aimed  at  identifying  structural  competition  concerns  in  the  ECS 
markets  which  are  not  currently  addressed  by  the  EECC.  If  the  need  for  further  regulatory 
intervention was identified in this sector, namely structural competition issues which are not 
currently addressed by the EECC, then the NRAs, applying the subsidiarity principle, should 
be  empowered  with  the  appropriate,  necessary  tools  and  competences,  in  order  to  ensure 
an  effective  and  consistent  implementation  of  the  EECC,  adapted  to  the  specific 
circumstances  of  their  national  markets.  This  could  be  done  by  a  revision  of  the  existing 
framework or by assigning the power of applying the NCT in the ECS sector to the NRAs in 
order to avoid an overlap in competences between different authorities. 

In  the  past,  BEREC  has  raised  proposals  to  address  structural  issues  in the  context  of the 
evolution  of  the  EECC,  specifically  in  relation  to  optimising  the  analysis  of  joint-dominance 
(based  on  tacit  collusion  also  addressed  in  the  EECC)  or  the  consideration  of  unilateral 
effects12.  If  the  NCT  were  implemented,  BEREC  considers  that  the  most  adequate  legal 
framework  to  address  these  issues  is  the  EECC  and  that  these  proposals  should  be 
considered as a complementary piece of the ex-ante regulatory framework to be applied by 
NRAs.

BEREC is eager to work together with the EC in the definition of the scope of new ex-ante 
competition tools, both to avoid overlaps with the EECC, and to complement, if appropriate, 
the current regulatory framework in a consistent manner. 

(ii) 

The interplay with the ex-ante regulatory framework proposed for DPs with SIP 

The same reasoning applies to the proposed ex-ante regulatory framework for DPs with SIP. 
As detailed in the BEREC response to the public consultation on the DSA Package, BEREC 
considers  that  an  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  targeting  DPs  with  SIP  can  address  the 
structural and specific issues raised by these platforms.  

If  the  regulatory  proposals  formulated  by  BEREC  for  DPs  with  SIP  were  adopted,  BEREC 
considers that the NCT should not overlap with this proposed ex-ante regulatory framework, 
and that the latter should be the applicable legislation (lex specialis principle). As in the case 
for  the  ECS  sector,  such  a  regulatory  framework  for  DPs  with  SIP  can  be  adapted  in  an 
efficient,  tailored  and  consistent  manner.  It  provides  a  scheme  for  predictable  and  timely 
intervention  to  address  the  identified  competition  problems,  while  creating  the  means  to 
pursue a variety of objectives and to address wider societal concerns.  

Therefore,  even  if  the  NCT  were  to  be  implemented  in  a  DP-related  environment,  BEREC 
considers  that  the  tool  should  be  included  within  the  proposed  regulatory  framework  and 
applied by the competent body, in order to avoid overlapping.
