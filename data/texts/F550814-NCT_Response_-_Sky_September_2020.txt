The proposal to create a ‘new competition tool’ 

Introduction 

The  Commission  has  proposed  the  introduction  of  a  ‘new  competition  tool’  (NCT)  to 
complement both existing competition law and proposed new ex ante regulation in the digital 
sector.    The  proposed  NCT  would  enable  the  Commission  to  introduce  significant  market 
interventions, including breaking up  firms, without a finding of abuse of dominance or other 
breach of competition law. 

Sky  strongly  opposes  the  introduction  of  a  NCT  that  applies  to  all  sectors  of  the  economy.  
Without prejudice to this position, if a NCT is introduced in any form, it should be the minimum 
required to address clearly defined problems in digital markets and any decisions taken under 
this regime must be subject to strong checks and balances given the potentially far reaching 
interventions that it would enable.  

Three core principles  

In  responding  to  this  consultation,  as  Europe’s  leading  entertainment  company  and  a  major 
investor  and  employer  in  the  European Union,  Sky  is  guided  by  three  key  principles:  (i)  legal 
certainty;  (ii)  the  need  for  clear  identification  of  problems  with  proportionate  regulation 
targeted at those  problems; and  (iii)  free trade. These principles are  deeply enshrined in the 
Union’s legal system and in the case of free trade, fundamental to its existence. They are vital 
in  ensuring  that  the  conditions  are  right  for  investment  and  innovation  and  in  ensuring  the 
competitiveness of the European market.   

With  these  core  principles  in  mind,  Sky  would  urge  the  Commission  to  proceed  cautiously 
before proposing new regulation.  The Commission must be confident that there is a clear and 
obvious gap within its existing toolkit and any new ex ante rules that are introduced and clear 
as to the specific problems that cannot be addressed with greater use of those powers. If, at 
the end of these consultations the Commission is satisfied that this threshold (which is a high 
one) is passed, then it must proceed cautiously in the design of any new NCT, to ensure it is 
the  minimum  required  to  address  clearly  identified  harms.    Failure  to  do  so  risks  significant 
unintended  consequences,  chilling  investment  and  undermining  the  significant  achievements 
made to date via the single market.   

Sky’s position      

Sky strongly opposes the introduction of a NCT applicable across all sectors of the economy. 

 
 
 
 
The proposal to develop a ‘new competition tool’ has emerged as part of the debate about the 
adequacy of existing competition law, and associated processes, to address issues associated 
with digital markets.  Indeed, the proposal forms part of the Commission’s package in relation 
to a Digital Services Act, and the inception impact assessment explicitly refers to its origin in 
relation to the broad discussion about whether competition law is fit for purpose in the digital 
age.  The proposal that it should apply to all sectors of the economy, rather than in relation to 
digital services, is an extremely significant extension of that original idea, and is not justified. 

As  noted  above,  the  impact  assessment  refers  to  the  fact  that  there  has  been  extensive 
discussion, and numerous in-depth inquiries, across the world, on the subject of the adequacy 
of existing competition law and processes in relation to digital products and services.  There 
has been no such discussion or debate in relation to the adequacy of existing competition law 
and processes in more traditional markets.  We consider that a proper debate and discussion 
of this issue is a critical pre-requisite for a proposal for a NCT that applies to all sectors of 
the economy.      

The  current  justifications  put  forward  for  a  broad  NCT  do  not  withstand  scrutiny.    The 
assertion that all sectors of the economy are becoming digitised, and therefore arguments in 
support  of  the  introduction  of  the  NCT  in  digital  sectors  apply  equally,  does  not  stand  up.  
Equally,  propositions  such  as  the  NCT  being  required  to  deal  with  undesirable  market 
structures, or behaviour of non-dominant firms, in all markets across the economy,  lack any 
justification and cannot form a proper basis for a wide-ranging NCT.  

If a NCT is required at all, to fill clearly identified gaps not currently served by Articles 101 
and  102,  sector  inquiries,  or,  importantly,  to  be  served  by  any  new  ex  ante  rules,  then  Sky 
considers that a more targeted and proportionate form of intervention, in digital markets only, 
is appropriate. 

Without  prejudice  to  this  position,  if  a  NCT  is  introduced,  in  any  form,  it  would  require 
fundamental changes to the current approach to checks and balances in the area of European 
competition policy.  A NCT of the type currently proposed would give the European Commission 
enormous  ability  to  intervene  in  markets  in  ways  that  have  potentially  far  reaching 
consequences  –  for  example,  by  forcing  companies  to  make  major  changes  to  their 
businesses,  including  requiring  divestments  –  without  any  finding  of  wrong-doing  or 
anticompetitive behaviour.   

One key check that would need to be reconsidered is the appeal process.  This would become 
of critical importance in the presence of a NCT as currently proposed. 

In particular, appeals of competition decisions in Europe currently take too long.   For example, 
the judgment overturning the European Commission’s decision in Three/O2 happened some 5 
years  after  the  deal  was  announced  and  long  after  it  could  be  resurrected.      Given  the 
potential  significant  economic  damage  that  could  result  from  inappropriate  interventions  in 
markets under the NCT, appeal processes would need to be much quicker. 

Sky  considers  that  there  would  be  significant  merit  in  consideration  being  given  to  the 
establishment of a specialist appeal tribunal, similar to the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal, 
to hear full merit-based appeals under the NCT (and potentially other competition cases) both 
in order to bring specialist expertise to bear, and to ensure timely appeals. 

Ideally, there would also be some separation as between the referring body, which identifies 
the relevant market to be investigated, and the decision-making body that decides if there is 

2 

an adverse effect  on  competition  in  that  market  and  whether  any  remedies are  required,  to 
ensure a ‘fresh pair of eyes’.  Potentially this could be achieved with the establishment of a 
separate investigatory body, separate from the decision-making authority.
