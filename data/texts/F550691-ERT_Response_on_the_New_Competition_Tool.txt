‘ERT’)  welcomes 

The  Competition  Policy  Working  Group  of  the  European  Round  Table  for  Industry 
to  ask 
(hereafter 
challenging questions about whether the competition rules are effective in the context 
of digitalisation, the fast pace of innovation in many sectors of the economy, and the 
emergence of new sources of finance, business models and powerful platforms.   

the  European  Commission’s  willingness 

ERT generally agrees that the current competition tools should be refined to remain 
effective.    For  example,  it  is  opportune  to  ensure  that  the  ongoing  reviews  of  the 
horizontal  and  vertical  cooperation  rules,  and  the  market  definition  Notice  are  fit  for 
the challenges posed by the modern economy, the particular characteristics of digital 
platforms  and  the  challenges  of  meeting  sustainability  targets,  without  unduly 
harming innovation incentives.

The proposed New Competition Tool (hereafter  ‘NCT’), on the other hand, does not 
seem  to  belong  to  the  EU  competition  toolbox.    Unlike  ex  ante  regulation,  EU 
antitrust rules are traditionally applied once problematic conduct has been identified 
in the context of defined markets and where there is a case to argue that the alleged 
distortion impacts the competitive process.  Digital platform markets have raised new 
challenges  and  a  debate  that  suggests  that  the  required  solutions  imply  a  less 
prominent  role  for  market  definition  (“we  should  put  less  emphasis  on  analysis  of 
market  definition,  and  more  emphasis  on  theories  of  harm  and  identification”1)  or 
even firm  conduct (“the challenges  to  effective  competition  in digital markets  do  not 
come  about  solely  because  of  platforms’  anti-competitive  behaviour  and  acquisition 
strategies”2). ERT considers that an NCT which disregards traditional considerations 
of market definition and firm conduct is not the appropriate response.  

ERT  queries  whether  there  is  an  adequate  legal  basis  for  an  instrument  as  far-
reaching  as  the  NCT.  More  fundamentally,  we  strongly  query  whether  there  is 
actually any significant enforcement gap that needs to be filled. This question could 
also  be  posed  for  any  ex  ante  regulatory  instrument  for  large  online  platforms,  the 
Digital Services Act (hereafter 'DSA'). 

If at all, any NCT would have to be a scope-limited complement to a possible DSA ex 
ante  regulation  and  only  a  proportionate  response  to  a  clearly  articulated  problem. 
The NCT would also need to consider the appropriateness of any dominance-based 
tool or market structure-based tool.   

Reliance on an NCT to shape markets is significantly more interventionist than typical 
infringement  proceedings  and the  imposition  of  fines.    Given the  characterisation  of 
competition  law  as  quasi-criminal  in  nature,  it  is  subject  to  robust  rights  of  defence 
and evidentiary standards of proof and full judicial review by the Court of Justice.3  An 
NCT that would allow the Commission to effectively redesign parts of the economy, 
including  forced  divestments  likely  below  market  value,  without  finding  infringement 
or  imposing  fines  as  a  means  of  avoiding  the  unlimited  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of 
Justice  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  fundamental  principles  that  underpin  the  EU 
competition  law  framework.  Even  if  the  NCT  would  not  lead  to  finding  of 
infringements  or  the  imposition  of  fines,  it  would  still  constitute  a  considerable 
intrusion into companies’ freedom of trade and industry.  It is therefore critical that the 
NCT  –  if  it  were  to  be  implemented  despite  the  reservations  outlined  below  –  be 
subject  to  the  same  standards  of  full  judicial  review.  These  safeguards  cannot  be 
short-circuited.

2.2 

Is there a gap such that existing tools and traditional doctrines are manifestly 
insufficient? 

The  current  proposal  would  confer  on  the  Commission  powers  that  are significantly 
more  interventionist  in  the  economy  than  the  ability  to  impose  fines  or  prohibit  a 
prospective  merger.  We  respectfully  submit  that  the  Commission  should  clearly 
define  the  circumstances  in  which  it  is  unable  to  act  (or  can  only  act  when  it  is  too 
late) with the tools that it has today, especially if those tools are to be complemented 
by  targeted  ex  ante  regulation  under  the  DSA  (which  would  need  to  be  scrutinised 
also). 

From the list of situations the Commission seeks to tackle with the NCT,4 it appears 
that  the  existing  competition  rules  are  sufficiently  flexible  to  cover  most  of  them  (or 
will be sufficient once updated further in the context of globalisation and digitisation, 
in  particular  with  regard  to  the  ongoing  reviews  of  the  Horizontal  and  Vertical 
Guidelines  and  Notice  on  Market  Definition).    There  are  a  range  of  ways  in  which 
they can be employed to capture attempts at monopolisation by gatekeeper platforms, 
tacit  collusion,  and  even  problematic  unilateral  conduct  of  non-dominant companies 
in a dynamic analysis.  

(a) 

Articles  102  TFEU  and  the  EU  Merger  Regulation  (hereafter  ‘EUMR’)  have 
been  interpreted  broadly  to  capture  competition  problems  caused  by 
oligopolies.  The  Airtours  case  lays  down  very  specific  conditions  for  the 
finding  of  collective  dominance:  (i)  each member  of  the  oligopoly  must  know 
how  the  other  members  are  behaving  in  order  to  adopt  the  same  policy 
(monitoring mechanism); (ii) there must be a deterrence mechanism allowing 
firms  to  sustain  collusion;  and  (iii)  customers  and  competitors  must  not  be 
able to jeopardise the collusion.5  Other judgments (Irish Sugar6, Compagnie 
Maritime  Belge 7 )  have  aligned  the  102  and  EUMR  tests,  clarifying  that 
structural  links  between  the  parties  are  not  necessary  for  a  finding  of 
collective dominance. 

(b) 

There  is  nothing  preventing  the  Commission  from  developing  its  analysis  of 
foreclosure incentives under Article 102 TFEU by drawing on its conglomerate 
effects analysis in the merger review context.8  In fact, it may be helpful for the 
Commission  to  update  its  Article  102  Enforcement  Priorities  Guidelines  to 
address this and certain other issues not currently covered. 

2.3 

Competition  law  intervention  that  tries  to  prevent  the  emergence  of  future  market 
players with some sort of entrenched or gatekeeper function, where competition is for 
the  market  rather  than  in  the  market,  may  change  incentives  and  deter  disruptive 
innovation. It is highly speculative to try to diagnose the likely causes of a predicted 
tipping  that  would  be  sufficiently  problematic  to  justify  intrusive  public  intervention 
and to do so in a proportionate way.  

4 Situations  listed  are:  markets  where  structural  competition  problems  may  arise  due  to  repeated  strategies  by  companies 
with market power to extend their market position into related markets, oligopolistic markets prone to tacit collusion in order 
to  preserve/improve  competition,  markets  where  structural  competition  problems  may  arise  due  to  anti-competitive 
monopolisation,  markets  where  pricing  algorithms  are  prevalent,  markets  where  there  is  a  risk  of  tipping,  markets 
characterised by 'gatekeeper' platforms.

6 Case T-228/97 Irish Sugar plc ν. Commission [1999] 
7 Cases C-395 and 396/96 P, Compagnie Maritime Belge Transports SA v. Commission [2000]. 
8 See  also  the  Commission’s decision  of  12  September  2016,  Case  AT.40265,  Greek  horse  race  betting  (OPAP)  based on 
Article  106  where  the  Commission  looked  into  the  ability  and  incentives  of  the  Greek  betting  monopoly  to  leverage  its 
position in horse race betting into other adjacent betting markets.

3.1 

There is scope for the Commission to make better use of the existing tools, for 
example more targeted investigations, interim measures, and sector inquiries  

The  Commission  already  enjoys  powers  that  can  be  helpful  to  address  the  listed 
concerns in most cases: 

(a) 

(b) 

Sector Inquiries: where the trend of trade between Member States, the rigidity 
of prices or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or 
distorted (Article 17 of Regulation 1/2003).  Sector inquiries can be employed 
in  a  more  targeted  and  nimble  way  and  are  more  proportionate  in  terms  of 
their  potential  consequences  where  market  failures  or  inefficiencies  are 
suspected; 

Behavioural or structural or hybrid remedies following a finding of infringement 
in  the  context  of  Articles  101  and  102  (especially  once  these  tools  are 
updated  further  to  the  ongoing  reviews  of  the  Horizontal  and  Vertical 
Guidelines and Notice on Market Definition) (Article 7); 

(c) 

Interim  measures  (limited  in  time)  and  subject  to  a  proper  investigation  and 
the existence of prima facie illegal behaviour (Article 8); 

(d) 

Commitments (Article 9). 

3.2 

In addition, under the current rules, nothing prevents the Commission from: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

Making  non-binding  recommendations  to  companies  in  a  time-sensitive 
manner (e.g. proposing codes of conducts and best practices) - it has done so 
recently in the case of Covid-related comfort letters; 

Informing and making recommendations/proposals to sectorial regulators;  

Informing and making legislative recommendations. 

3.3 

3.4 

To address competition problems in a timely and effective manner (one of the stated 
purposes  of  the  NCT),  the  Commission  may  employ  the  considerable  armoury  it 
already  has  available  to  it.  It  is  able  to  ask  questions  to  understand  better  how 
potentially  problematic  or  fast-moving  markets  are  developing,  to  open  more  cases 
and  to  test  new  theories  of  harm  and  should  demonstrate  a  willingness  to  close 
investigations at an early stage when it transpires that there is no credible theory of 
material  harm,  and  consider  how  to  publicly  share  the  learnings  of  such  case 
closures [this point seeks to address the fact that we need more guidance in 101 and 
102 cases]. 

There  is  nothing  to  prevent  the  Commission  from  testing  the  law  before  the  courts 
with  punctual  decisions  that  target  specific  harmful  conduct  which  constitutes  an 
infringement of Articles 101 or 102 TFEU. Together with setting internal deadlines to 
close  proceedings  within  a  reasonable  timeframe,  more  targeted  decisions  (formal 
and  informal)  decision  (and  guidance)  could  achieve  the  objective  of  more  timely 
interventions.

ERT  queries  whether  there  is  a  sufficiently  clear  legal  basis  to  justify  the 
adoption of the NCT  

The proposed legal basis of the NCT is the combined application of Articles 103 and 
114 TFEU.   

Article 103 TFEU does not appear to be an adequate legal basis because the NCT is 
not  intended  to  give  effect  to  the  principles  set  out  in  Articles  101  and  102  of  the 
TFEU but rather creates new competition enforcement powers that go beyond these 
principles.  It  will  be  applied  in  ex  ante  intervention  that  is  not  necessarily  related  to 
either the behaviour (misconduct) of the targeted company or any infringement by a 
firm that enjoys a dominant position in any given market which are the basis of any 
application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.  

Article 114 TFEU is the legal basis for the Commission to propose any legislative tool 
aimed  at  harmonising  law  across  Member  States  in order to avoid  fragmentation  of 
the  internal  market.  However,  according  to  the  Roadmap,  the  purpose  of  a  NCT  is 
not  to  remove  distortions  of  competition  law  but  rather  to  eliminate  structural  risks 
and deficits that are below the thresholds of competition law. The need to harmonise 
national  competition  laws,  consumer  protection  laws,  or  sectorial  regulations  would 
have to be demonstrated to justify the NCT. 

A more appropriate legal basis would appear to be Article 352 TFEU (the “flexibility 
clause”)  for  cases  when  “action  by  the  Union  should  prove  necessary,  within  the 
framework  of the  policies  defined in the  Treaties,  to  attain one of the  objectives  set 
out  in  the  Treaties”,  which  requires  unanimity  of  the  Council  and  European 
Parliament’s  consent.    Such  Article  shows  how  new  Union  powers  require  Member 
State support as well as democratic involvement.9 

Finally, the NCT may address market-wide concerns that fall under consumer policy, 
which is a shared responsibility between the European Union and the Member States.  
We  note  incidentally  that  the  UK  Competition  and  Markets  Authority  (‘CMA’),  in 
applying its market investigation tool, has both competition and consumer powers. 

9 See also the Protocol (No 27) on the internal market and competition: “The High Contracting Parties, considering that the 
internal market as set out in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union includes a system ensuring that competition is not 
distorted, have agreed that: to this end, the Union shall, if necessary, take action under the provisions of the Treaties, 
including under Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union”.

Targeted  regulation  is  a  better  solution  to  structural  problems  or  market 
failures in sectors where competition law cannot effectively address the issues  

Competition  law  driven  regulatory  provisions  are  also  embedded  in  EU  regulations 
covering other sectors of the economy (e.g. gas, power, telecoms, railway transport, 
financial  and  postal  services,  etc.),  where,  for  example,  unbundling  and  third  party 
access regimes have been set in place to address concerns similar to some of those 
characterising new markets. 

In  those  sectors,  DG  COMP  and  other  competition  authorities  can  and  do  make 
recommendations  to  regulators  or  legislators  to  address  concerns.    This  was 
essentially  the  conclusion  reached  by  the  UK  CMA  in relation to  its  probe  of  digital 
advertising.    Despite  considerable  experience  with  and  pride  in  its  tool,  the  CMA 
declined  to  make  a  reference  for  a  market  inquiry  and  preferred  to  make 
recommendations to the Government on a regulatory reform (para 89 final report).  

Ex  ante  regulations  can  be  enacted  for  a  period  and  adjusted  to  reflect  market 
developments  with  due  legislative  scrutiny  and  democratic  legitimacy.  The  EU 
regulatory  framework  for  electronic  communications,  the  Open  Internet  Regulation, 
the  Platform-to-Business  (P2B)  Regulation,  the  Digital  Content  Directive  and  the 
revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (PSD2)  are  examples  of  regulation  to  tackle 
indirect  network  effects,  customer  acquiescence,  information  asymmetries  and 
varying levels of dependency on key players.   

The NCT would possibly overlap significantly with the DSA, in particular with respect 
to  addressing  concerns  around  gatekeepers  and  tipping.    If  the  proposed    DSA 
Package,  were  enacted,  this  new  legislative  tool  would    tackle  market  failures  to 
ensure  that  the  key  concern  identified  to  date  by  the  Commission  of  markets 
characterised  by 
large  platforms  with  significant  network  effects  acting  as 
gatekeepers remain fair and contestable for innovators, businesses, and new market 
entrants. 

Targeted  regulation  is  often  a  more  appropriate  solution  in  some  circumstances, 
coupled  with  the  application  of  the  existing  competition  rules,  which  still  have  the 
scope  to  evolve  (for  example  in  terms  of  extending  the  consideration  of  benefits  to 
consumers in sustainability cooperations beyond focus on consumer prices) and in a 
more  timely  way.  The  need for  an  NCT should only  be  assessed  if  an enforcement 
gap  is  clearly  established  in  relation  to  the  abusive  practices  of  hyper-  or  super- 
scalers / super dominant players in the digital arena.  

As  to  other  markets  and  sectors  (including  oligopolistic  market  structures),  ERT 
considers  that  the  existing  competition  law  framework,  and  specific  sectoral 
regulation  when  needed,  have  proven  to  be  sufficient  to  address  any  potential 
competition issues. ERT also recalls that for European players to remain competitive 
on a global scale, it is important to avoid the chilling effects of adding extra layers of 
regulatory scrutiny on top of the already existing rules.   

5.7 

Adopting a broad horizontal tool primarily designed to tackle problems in one sector 
of  the  economy  creates  complexity  with  potential  spill-over  effects  creating 
uncertainty in the broader economy.

6.4 

EU competition framework is not suited for the adoption of a tool such as the 
UK Markets Investigation (‘MI’) 

DG COMP cannot act as inquisitor, judge and jury in any NCT process.  The Court of 
Justice’s full judicial review is what makes the current EU system compliant with 
fundamental rights (KME Germany, Chalkor, Galp).  If an NCT were to be adapted, 
robust checks and balances would be fundamental to its legitimacy, which would 
require substantial changes to the institutional structure of EU competition 
enforcement. 

The UK MI  tool  embodies  strong  governance provisions  with  numerous checks  and 
balances.  It is triggered either by a reference from a limited set of external bodies, or 
following  an  own  initiative  study  by  the  CMA.    This  market  study  phase  is  itself  a 
burdensome  exercise  for  the  authority,  such  that  embarking  on  any  subsequent 
investigation is a serious undertaking. 

The  UK  MI  tool  embodies  a  clear  split  between  the  decision  to  refer  a  market  for 
investigation taken by the CMA Board, and the final MI decision that is made by  an 
external  panel  of  qualified  experts  who  are  non-political  highly  experienced 
independent members who are not CMA staff. 

The  UK  rules  provide  for  a  highly  transparent  process,  with  the  possibility  for 
companies  in  the  targeted  market(s)  to  express  their  views  throughout  the  whole 
process.  The UK MI tool sets out a continuous dialogue between the affected firms 
and 
the  CMA,  mainly  by  means  of  formal  hearings,  published  preliminary 
conclusions/proposed  remedies  which  the  affected  parties  can  comment  on    and 
remedies hearings when the Market Study turns to a Market Reference.  

6.5 

The CMA has published detailed guidance10 on its approach to proportionality:  

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

A proportionate remedy is one that:  (a) is effective in achieving its legitimate 
aim;  (b)  is  no  more  onerous  than  needed  to  achieve  its  aim;  (c)  is  the  least 
onerous if there is a choice between several effective measures; and (d) does 
not produce disadvantages which are disproportionate to the aim. 

Applying  these  principles  to  the  circumstances  of  particular  cases  usually 
involves  consideration  of  remedy  options  both  relative  to  other  effective 
measures as well as relative to taking no action. 

The  CMA  applies  these  principles  to  the  evaluation  of  individual  measures 
within a package of remedies as well as to the package taken as a whole. 

6.6 

The CMA has concurrent competition law and consumer protection law powers that 
position  it  better  to take full  account  not  only  of regulatory  and structural issues  but 
also of consumer behavioural factors, privacy concerns and issues of fairness.  Many 
market  investigations  in the  UK  result  in recommendations  to government  or  sector 
regulators  to  change  the  law  or  adapt  regulation  or  how  it  is  enforced  rather  than 
specific  remedies.    In  addition,  the  UK  has  a  system  of  concurrency  between  the 
CMA and these sector regulators that allow the latter to monitor and enforce any MI 
remedies.    Sector-specific  regulators  are  better  placed  to  adjust  remedies  to  fast-
changing markets and to ensure adequate enforcement.  These important attributes 
are not present at EU level.11

Competition Law & Practice (2020).  ERT recommends considering the shortcomings flagged by the author.

6.7 

These  unique  aspects  of  the  UK  MI  (two-stage  process,  transparency,  difficulty  of 
law 
devising  a  remedy  within  the 
jurisdiction)  and  the  limitations  of  DG  COMP  acting  as  a  de  facto  regulator  in 
monitoring and enforcing remedies, show that there is no basis for the introduction of 
an NCT at EU level with a broad intervention scope. 

tight  timeline,  dual  competition/consumer 

7. 

The  risk  of  greater  uncertainty and increased politicisation  of  the competition 
rules globally  

7.1  Companies  are  facing  rising  geopolitical  tensions  that  have  led  to  protectionist 
measures  and  the  pursuit  of  industrial  policy  objectives  under  the  guise  of 
competition law enforcement in many parts of the world. 

7.2  Most  countries  around  the  world  rightfully  look  to  the  EU  competition  regime  as  a 
model to emulate.  Should the EU enact the NCT, there is a real risk of a proliferation 
of  such  instruments  that,  in  turn,  will  significantly  increase  the  politicisation  of  the 
competition  rules  around  the  world.    The  potential  for  regulatory  drag  on  global 
markets will increase exponentially.  

The  trend  towards  more  intervention  and  more  complexity  reduces  legal  certainty 
and  has  a  chilling  effect  on  procompetitive  initiatives  and  investments.    The  EU 
competition  regime  must  remain  a  beacon  of  transparency,  predictability  and  due 
process. 

8. 

Need for procedural safeguards and conditions for any NCT 

8.1  Only if it is established that the combination of the review of the current competition 
toolbox  adapted  to  the  digital  economy  together  with  a  potential  sector  specific 
framework established by the DSA is likely to be materially insufficient, a limited NCT 
should only be a solution to address misconduct of hyper- or super-scalers / super-
dominant gatekeeper platforms that threaten structural harm. 

8.2 

The  NCT  should  then  have  strict  limitations,  clear  definitions  for  the  intervention 
scope and procedural rights of defence, including: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

(g) 

(h) 

Clear  definition  of  “large  digital  platforms”  is  key  with  a  focus  on  market 
dominance  or  gatekeeper  status  (for  consistency,  DSA  definitions  should  be 
used in case this would be introduced);  

A  focus  on  making  (binding  and/or  non-binding)  recommendations  to 
policymakers, sectorial regulators, and voluntary measures agreed with by the 
targeted companies; 

Any NCT should be impact-tested for a limited period; 

Defined timelines; 

Transparency/access to information and the case team; 

Hearings 
concerned throughout the procedure; 

to  ensure  constant  dialogue  with  all  relevant  undertakings 

Clear  separation  of  investigation  and  decision-making  roles  with  a  review 
panel challenging the investigation team's findings; and 

Full  judicial  review  by  the  Court  of  Justice,  preferably  on  a  fast-track 
procedure in the interests of legal certainty.

Conclusions 

9.1 

For  European  companies  to  compete  successfully  at  scale  in  today’s  fast-moving 
economy,  they  need  competition  policies  that  seek  to  create  a  global  level  playing 
field and that are sufficiently responsive to changing global market conditions, without 
undue complexity and legal uncertainty.12 

9.2 

ERT welcomes any initiatives to maintain European competitiveness and recognises 
that: 

(a) 

(b) 

The  Commission  could  usefully  increase  the  use  of  existing  tools  such  as 
sector inquiries, interim measures, speedier and more targeted investigations 
to establish precedent in shorter timeframes; 

EU competition tools may be sharpened but are fundamentally sound. If these 
are considered insufficient, the possibility of supplementing them with ex ante 
regulation  (focussed  on  very  large  dominant  gatekeepers)  deserves  to  be 
evaluated first; 

9.3  Quick but targeted enforcement against abusive practices of hyper- or super- scalers 
/  super-dominant  gatekeepers  via  an  NCT  (where  it  has  been  clearly  identified  that 
the current  competition  rules are  not  adequate  in terms  of  powers  or timing)  should 
only be implemented to the extent an enforcement gap is clearly established subject 
to any proposed DSA ex ante regulation, and subject to two critical caveats: (i) that 
appropriate  procedural  safeguards  are  built  in,  and  (ii)  that  the  new  rules  do  not 
introduce legal uncertainty in the broader economy.

The European Round Table for Industry (ERT) is a forum that brings together around 55 Chief 
Executives and Chairmen of major multinational companies of European parentage, covering a wide 
range of industrial and technological sectors. ERT strives for a strong, open and competitive Europe 
as a driver for inclusive growth and sustainable prosperity. Companies of ERT Members are situated 
throughout Europe, with combined revenues exceeding €2 trillion, providing around 5 million direct 
jobs worldwide - of which half are in Europe - and sustaining millions of indirect jobs. They invest 
more than €60 billion annually in R&D, largely in Europe.  

This response is submitted by the Competition Policy Working Group of the European Round Table
