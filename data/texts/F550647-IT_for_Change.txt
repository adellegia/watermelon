Abstract

Big Tech is seen to have become too powerful, and causing many economic, social and 

political problems. But there still has hardly been any real challenge to its apparently 

unstoppable march. Piecemeal efforts – from huge fines and sanctions to disallowing 

platforms from competing with dependent businesses – have failed to make any sig-

nificant dent on the dominant digital economy model, which is getting entrenched as 

the ‘new normal’. The problem here may be that the regulators are trying industrial era 

remedies on digital age problems.

Digital economy paradigm must be understood in its significant discontinuities with 

the industrial age. Regulation of digital economy needs to focus on the central role 

of data and data-derived intelligence. Competition regulators either ignore these key 

factors, or simply take a superficial view. A relatively better understanding about them 

is developing in the somewhat distant realm of technology governance; with its new 

focus on data sharing, data infrastructures, cloud neutrality, open digital ecosystems, 

domestic AI competencies, and public interest AI. Technology governance, however, 

normally does not have the enforcement teeth of competition regulators.

Bringing together these two governance or regulatory traditions – about competition 

and technology, the paper proposes a composite new regulatory framework for the 

digital economy. Digital ecosystems are presented as the key new structural feature of 

the digital economy, increasingly superseding IP firms led industrial value chains. The 

focus is then drawn on the effective economic governance of data, cloud computing 

and AI – the building blocks of these digital ecosystems.

Considering data and cloud computing as infrastructural elements, with open and 

equitable access for digital businesses, will ensure the greatest digital productivity. AI 

based global power concentration can be addressed by models that adequately distrib-

ute society’s digital intelligence in space and ownership. While behavioural remedies 

have their role, the paper also presents a regulatory ideal-type of structural separa-

tions between the four key functional layers of digital value chains; data layer, cloud 

computing layer, intelligence layer and consumer facing intelligent services layer. The 

paper concludes that any successful regulation of the digital economy will require a 

new legislation and a separate digital economy regulator.

1.  Introduction

Big Tech is a term employed for global digital monopolies like Google, Amazon, 

 Facebook, Apple and Alibaba. It is a common refrain nowadays in media, and among 

politicians and people, in general, that Big Tech has become too powerful. It is  starting 

to dominate our economy, society, culture and politics. As digital technologies become 

integral to managing our personal lives, digital corporations are disrupting, and 

 controlling, major parts of sectors like commerce (Amazon) and transport (Uber). 

Early trends indicate that a similar fate may only be a matter of time for other sectors – 

whether hotels, food, health and education or agriculture and manufacturing. A strong 

view is emerging that such concentration of economic and social power with a very 

few global digital corporations is both unprecedented and unsustainable.

No effective framework exists for regulating such immense digital power. Current 

responses, if any, are reactive and piecemeal, and not based on an adequate analysis 

of digital power. Examples of such reactions are; asking digital platforms to share ad 
 revenue with media houses,1 declaring ride-hailing platforms as employers of cab 
 drivers,2 and, in India, using foreign investment laws to regulate e-commerce platforms.3 

Digital economy comprises very new forms of economic relationships and structures, 

representing a fundamental shift from industrial era economic organization. Existing 

regulatory frameworks are built for the industrial era. Their failure in regulating a 

digital economy is more and more evident. The digital economy has to be viewed as a 

novel and distinct kind of economic system, involving key new factors of production 
of data4 and digital intelligence.5 Based on such an understanding, new principles

of regulation need to be framed for the digital economy. This paper makes an initial 

attempt in this direction. 

The paper begins by pointing out a few strong indications of unsustainable digital 

power concentration (section 2), and then examines how it is currently being addressed 

by researchers, policy-makers and regulators (section 3). Next, it argues why current 

approaches are failing, and how even the strongest among them are unlikely to be 

effective (section 4). The paper proposes that a more pro-active regulatory frame-

work is required that is specially designed for the new realities of a digital economy 

(section 5). The following section discusses the unique nature of digital economy 

and  important concepts required to understand it (section 6). Digital ecosystems, 

in  contrast to  platforms, are then presented as the key structural feature of a digital 

economy and society (section 7). The paper proposes a new regulatory approach based 

on  structural separation between four important functional layers of data and digital 

intelligence value chains (section 8). The following three sections discuss governance 

of data  (section 9), governance of cloud services (section 10), and governance of soci-

ety’s digital intelligence (section 11). Citing from emerging policy documents in some 

countries, the closing section argues for new legislation to underpin digital economy 

regulation, and a separate digital economy regulator (section 12). 

The paper employs a political economy lens, examining the nature and location of 

power in emerging digital economy systems, and ways to distribute it more equitably. 

It attempts to interpret and analyse digital economy developments in non-business and 

non-technical terms (with a fair amount of tech demystification), employing social, 

economic and political economy vocabulary. To this end, the paper ventures into new 

concepts and theory development where needed. It considerably leans on bringing 

together two distinct regulatory traditions – market power regulation anchored in 

competition authorities on one side, and technology regulation by telcom/IT regulators 

on the other. Both have been trying to address digital dominance, but in different and 
relatively unconnected ways.6

  6  One example of it is the centrality of AI in most digital society discussions, but there being almost no economic 
conception or approach around it. On the other hand, technology space driven ideas like data infrastructures tend 
to skirt key issues regarding how resources related transactions actually take place in an economy.

2.  Digital economic power and its concentration

The global list of top ten companies by market capitalization was dominated in 2009 

by oil corporations, the industrial era giants. Ten years later, seven of the top ten 
have data-centric business models.7 These digital corporations built their multi-billion 

 fortunes in a fraction of the time taken by their predecessors. The Economist considers 

such developments as possibly indicating an alarming concentration of economic and 
political power in the near future.8 With many parts of the economy still to digitalize, 

tech firms are expected to grow even bigger as they diversify into more industries.

When Microsoft became the most valued company at the turn of the century, it was 

genuinely a provider of technology. Computing was entering into everything, and most 

personal computers ran Microsoft’s operating software. As applications on personal 

computers needed to talk to one another, Microsoft tapped the network effect. Once a 

clear lead over its competitors was developed, it had a free run, given the very low mar-

ginal cost of producing software. Fast forward to 2015 when Microsoft gave its Windows 
10 software upgrade for free.9 The company has become a big votary for free and open 
source software,10 which its leaders had called a ‘new communism’ and a cancer in the 
heydays of its software monopoly.11 Much of personal computing today is done on mobiles 

and tablets, dominated by the free operating software Android provided by Google. If 

technology is being given out for free, one must explore what is the real stock-in-trade 

of dominant digital corporations that makes them so rich and powerful so quickly. 

Google started as a service that organized information on the web and made it easily 

searchable. Running such a platform, it developed expertise in managing and  exploiting

people’s data. Google’s approach to dominating various sectors comes from its  exceptional 

data competencies. Google’s sister automobile company, Waymo, is tipped in ten years 
to be bigger than Ford, GM, Fiat, Honda and Tesla combined.12 Didi in China began 

by organising taxi drivers on a digital platform. It now advices global car-makers on 
designing cars, since it holds the data about how cars get actually used.13 Apple, Google 
and Amazon are getting into the health sector.14 Becoming the sector’s main technology 

provider is not their real objective; it is to control its key data. And, based on the insights 
or intelligence so obtained to fundamentally transform the health sector.15

Digital corporations’ presence in various sectors is currently at different levels, but the 

prognosis and trends are telling for almost all of them. In some places digital corpora-

tions are entering into partnerships with traditional players; at others the traditional 

players are themselves seeking to become data-centric. In any case, it is owning and 

controlling data, and data-based intelligence, that is emerging as the main business 

advantage. It is likely to exceed the advantage of owning key intellectual property in 

any sector. It is this shift that can be considered as denoting the advent of a digital 

economy. Major global car manufacturers are grumbling that digital corporations 

may be pushing them to the lower rungs of automobiles value chains. Similar is the 
emerging digital dependency of major news brands.16 In a digital economy, companies 

that have a sector’s key data, and posses the highest data competencies, will digitally 

re-organize every sector. Such digital corporations will thus lead the respective sector’s 

value chains, hitherto led by companies holding important intellectual property or IP. 

Modern IP-based firms tend to focus on their core competencies, preferring to out-

source as much of the physical activities as possible. E-commerce value chains seem to

be showing the opposite trend, of tighter vertical integration. E-commerce platforms 

are going upstream, into manufacturing and trading, and downstream into logistics, 
distribution and payments. This corresponds to how, around the advent of 20th cen-

tury, the early ‘corporation’ was created through vertical integration of allied busi-

nesses. (As section 4 of this paper explains, with digital corporations too this may be 

a temporary, first-phase, phenomenon.) At another level, the IT industry used to be 

most open. A corner-shop could assemble personal computers out of globally sourced 

components. Software and applications were developed separate from the hardware, 

and could be employed across hardware platforms. But such openness, it appears, 

was for the  pre-digital and pre-data era. The dominant global digital players are now 

developing their own computer chips, hardware, cloud computing infrastructure, data 

lakes, and AI software, going right up to consumer facing digital services in different 

sectors. Consolidation is also occurring horizontally, across sectors, with the same data 

company getting into sectors as diverse as travel, employment, automobiles, health 
and education.17 

A key facet of digital power is in how digital corporations exercise deep and granular 

real-time control over all activities and actors in a value chain. Such unprecedented 

micro-control is mediated not so much by market power or legal contracts – as with 

industrial era value chains, but through employing intelligence derived from data. 
Uber plans to control the entire transportation sector and not just the cab business.18 
It claims to be developing an operating system for everyday life.19 Uber’s new financial 

services for drivers, based on their data, could trap them in never-ending loan cycles, 
thus enslaving them forever.20 With Uber Money, consumption and expenditure by 

Uber drivers could also be cycled within Uber’s systems. Caught in Uber’s 360 degree 

data-based watch and control, drivers risk becoming a veritable appendage of the Uber

corporation. This is quite unlike traditional employment or other economic relation-

ships. (That is of course only until driverless cars are found more profitable to deploy.) 

There is a marked geo-economic angle to digital consolidation. US and Chinese firms 

account for ninety per cent of the market capitalization value of world’s seventy largest 
digital platforms.21 These two digital super-powers are fast moving so ahead of the 

rest of the world in digital terms that even an economic power-house like the EU is 
threatened by digital colonization.22 This is a very dramatic shift, absolutely unthinkable 

just two decades back. The current trajectory points to the digital layer of global value 

chains in all sectors cornering the bulk of control and value in not-too-distant a future. 

This digital layer is tightly concentrated in the hands of a very few global corporations, 

almost all based in the US or China. The race between these two for digital supremacy 

has become so intense that global technology value chains are splitting between them, 
creating the fear that a ‘digital Berlin Wall’ might be emerging.23 All other countries 

may find themselves forced to ‘choose a side’ in terms of whose digital technologies 
to adopt, with potentially serious long-term economic and security ramifications.24

If already not under-way, data-based transformation will take place in all sectors, as 

surely as industrial revolution mechanized all sectors, structurally transforming them. 

These digital transformations are attended with an unprecedented concentration of 

power in the hands of a very few global digital corporations. As digital  transformation 

matures in all sectors, digital power concentration of the current early digital era will 

further intensify. The head of International Monetary Fund observes that “... this 
 troubling trend is reminiscent of the early part of the 20th century – when the twin 

forces of technology and integration led to the first gilded age…. There is no substitute 
for high-quality regulation and supervision.”25

At  that  time,  powerful  new  industrial  technologies  and  economic  integration 

were  relatively distinct phenomenon that were brought together through a new 

 organizational form – the ‘industrial corporation’. Digital technologies, on the other 

hand, are  themselves means of integration of economic activities as they also transform 

the processes and outputs of production. Their integration and control feature, in fact, 

is one of their most important values and roles in the new digital  economy  systems. 

Data based intelligence helps integrate and closely manage economic  activities right 

from the global level to micro-processes penetrating what people and machines do 

at homes and at workplaces. The ‘digital corporation’ therefore is a very new  animal, 

and the dangers of economic domination from it are likely to be much worse. 

3.  Emerging regulatory responses to 
digital dominance 

Digital power concentration does not just impact the economy, but also media,  politics, 

security, and more. It creates the basis for all-round economic, social, political and cul-

tural power. There is a rising concern across the world that dominant digital corporations 

need to be regulated, reining in their economic and social power. It is strongly evident in 

the EU, which fears marginalization in the emerging bi-polar digital world led by the US 
and China.26 Developing countries are worried about a new form of subjugation through 
digital colonization.27 Even in the US, home to most global digital behemoths, academics, 
politicians and regulators alike are seeking urgent action to address tech power.28

Traditional economic governance perspectives are being brought to bear upon the 

 digital economy phenomenon in its many novelties. Most dominant digital corporations 

operate some kind of a platform that becomes the main space for online interactions

among economic actors in a sector. It is these digital platforms that are attracting most 
policy and regulatory attention.29 

Early regulatory approaches treated platforms as two sided markets. Facebook, for 

instance, provides social networking services on one side, and advertisement services 

on the other – to very different users. Such a ‘market’ tends to subsidize its users on 

one side employing revenues from the other side. It is aimed at rapidly enhancing the 

user base on the subsidized side. Such an increased user base enhances the value of the 

platform for the other side as well, thus establishing a virtuous cycle. The platform seeks 

to quickly establish a dominant, hopefully monopoly, position in a sector, as its default 

‘go to’ place. Such cross subsidy, often resulting even in free services to consumers, can 

create considerable entry barriers. This obviously has a strong anti-competitive impact. 

But regulators have mostly taken a benign view of such cross subsidy considering it 

consumer welfare enhancing. Platforms, it is argued, provide innovative services and 
ensure conveniences, and do so at low costs or free, which is best not to interfere with.30 

Due to network effect – i.e. more the number of actors already on a platform, more useful 

it is to additional users – and economies of scale, such platforms tend to quickly become 

a monopoly. Their online dominance, however, may not be considered anti-compet-

itive if the market of online transactions of any goods or services is not taken to be a 

distinct market, but a part of the larger market for those goods/services which includes 
traditional offline channels.31 The Competition Commission of India (CCI) took this 
view in relation to e-commerce in 2014.32 

Later, in 2018, the CCI agreed to consider e-commerce as a distinct market, but held that 
there were a number of platforms in it and therefore no dominance.33 In early 2020, the

Appellate Tribunal overturned this CCI order and asked it to investigate allegations of 
market dominance by the top e-commerce platform in India.34 The petitioner, an asso-

ciation of sellers on online platforms, had argued that they are very strongly dependent 

on e-commerce platforms. They asserted that inter alia user reviews and ratings create a 
‘lock-in effect on sellers’.35 Just two months before the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, 

CCI had admitted another complaint against top e-commerce platforms and this time 

initiated an investigation. The CCI chair observed: “We will get to understand the entire 
business model of the e-commerce sector through this investigation”.36 

This investigation coincided with the CCI releasing a study of the e-commerce  market.37 

It identified a lot of potential competition related issues with this market. The CCI 

study observed that bargaining power imbalance and information asymmetry between 

e-commerce marketplace platforms and their business users was at the core of such 

issues. It argues that in the context of “economics of platform markets, where the 

winner takes all or most, eliminating anti-competitive behaviour that further tilts the 

scales or deters entry assumes utmost importance”. While maintaining that insights 

from the study will inform future competition enforcement in these markets, the CCI 

refrained at this stage from making any determination, or framing any ex ante rules. 

The study advices that marketplace platforms should adopt self-regulatory measures in 

five areas outlined by it, with some guidelines under each. These guidelines can be seen 

as a preview of the kind of remedies that the Commission may impose on dominant 

platforms in the future. Some of them may get formalized as ex ante rules for digital 

platforms that meet certain threshold conditions.

UK’s Digital Competition Experts Panel (“UK Panel”) proposes establishing a  digital plat-
form code of conduct, based on a set of core principles outlined by it.38 The code would 

apply to those digital platforms that get designated to have a strategic  market status. The 

UK Panel warns against the danger of relying solely on traditional  competition policy 

tools for regulating the digital economy, advocating legislative changes as required. 

An awareness is growing that digital platforms cannot be governed by traditional com-

petition rules alone. Theirs are no ordinary services – not even ordinary marketplace 

services, like provided by a shopping mall – operating in a market that they may or 

may not dominate, which becomes a matter for case-to-case determination. Digital 

platforms posses certain essential features that tend them towards dominating and 

monopolistic positions. The CCI study and the UK Panel discuss at length many such 

inherent tendencies of digital platforms. A European Union Report on ‘Competition 

policy for the digital era’ (“EU Report”) makes an interesting observation that “to 

protect competition on a dominant platform ...in many cases might be the same as 
protecting competition “in” the market...”.39 “In this respect, we argue that platforms 

play a form of regulatory role as they determine the rules according to which their 

users, including consumers, business users and providers of complementary services, 

interact, and, when they are dominant, have a responsibility to ensure that competition 

on their platforms is fair, unbiased, and pro-users.” 

Julie Cohen proposes that “platforms do not enter or expand markets; they replace 
(and rematerialize) them”.40 This view corresponds to the EU Report comparing man-

agement of platforms to market governance, with platforms acting as the regulators of 

economic interaction spaces that they enclose. It also relates to the kind of regulatory 
approaches for digital platforms being considered in India41 and the UK. Rather than

competition ‘in’ the market of online marketplaces or digital platforms (which remains 

a separate concern), the focus here is on ensuring competition ‘on’ a digital platform, 

which is considered as a ‘market in itself ’. We can call this the ‘platform as market’ 

paradigm of regulation.

Coming from telecommunication regulation, the principle of net neutrality requires a 

transmission network to remain agnostic or neutral to the content transmitted over it. 

This principle has been extended to platforms in the form of ‘platform neutrality’. Also 

employed by the referred CCI study on e-commerce market, this term first appeared 

in a 2015 report of the French Digital Council. It observed: “The goals behind the 
 neutrality principle should also be factored into the development of  digital platforms”.42 

One way to regulate ‘Platform as market’ is through what in competition policy parlance 

are called behavioural remedies. The dominant player is obligated to undertake a series 

of actions or abstentions in order to improve competition. These could range from 

simple transparency and information sharing to non-discrimination among products 

and services traded on the platform. The EU Report observed that, since platforms 

function as regulators, competition policy should focus on regulating and disciplining 
the rules-setting power of digital platforms.43 

A new EU regulation on B2B interactions on platforms seeks to ensure a fair, predictable, 
sustainable and trusted online business environment.44 Its provisions address issues of 

transparency and complaint redressal. Transparency requirements include information 

about the basis for product ranking, any differential treatments to own products, and 

use and access to data, and its sharing with third parties. Apart from putting many such 

transparency requirements for e-commerce platforms, the draft e-commerce policy of 
India proposes an outright ban on differential treatment.45

The self regulatory code proposed by the CCI Study, and the UK Panel’s digital platform 

code of conduct, also centre on behavioural remedies, as does the EU Report. Focus 

is mostly still on market relationships between a platform and the sellers on it – like 
exclusive agreements and preferential sellers, and price issues like deep discounting.46 

But behavioural remedies are increasingly also about data – transparency about data 

collection, data interoperability, and data access and sharing. The EU is investigating 

the issue of rights to data about goods sold by traders on the Amazon platform from 
a competition viewpoint.47 In the CCI Study restaurant owners working with food 

delivery companies wanted the latter to share data about their customers with them.

Interventions for regulating ‘platform as market’ try to monitor and check a platform’s 

behaviour vis a vis economic actors using the platform. Promoting competition among 

digital platforms, the original issue of their dominance, also remains important. These 

two kinds of problems and corresponding remedies are connected. Reduced lock-in and 

greater independence for economic actors on a platform both increase competition on 

that platform as well as between platforms. On the other hand, a competitive field of 

digital platforms in a sector tends to decrease the lock-in and increases the independ-

ence of economic actors transacting on them. Interventions for ensuring competition 

among digital platforms have hitherto been weak or non-existent. These mostly relate 

to data portability and data sharing. Such obligations are very difficult to monitor and 

enforce without specialized capacities among the regulators, including technical ones, 

and have not been effectively applied in any jurisdiction so far.

The problem with behavioural remedies is that they require constant close monitoring 

and frequent action by the regulators. This issue is greatly aggravated in the digital context 

which changes extremely fast and contains too many unknowns – or difficult-to-knows. 

This renders enforcing behavioural remedies for digital platforms a very difficult task for 
any regulator, much more so for a general cross-sectoral competition regulator.48 Herold

Feld of Public Knowledge, a US based non-profit, considers the nature of digital plat-

forms, and their domination, to be unique enough to require specific sectoral regula-

tions (for each digitalized sector) as well as a specialized cross-sectoral legislation and 

supervisory body. He makes the case for a Digital Platforms Act and a Digital Platforms 
Commission.49 A tool-kit of behavioural regulatory interventions is proposed. But deeper 

structural remedies of forcing separation of platforms related businesses may also be 

considered, if required. The criterion of ‘cost of exclusion’ can be employed to measure 

platform  dominance. 

In her paper ‘The Separation of Platforms and Commerce’, Lina Khan argues that, 

apart from being difficult to undertake, behavioural remedies will not be adequate to 
tackle the market power of platforms.50 Being an essential facility controlling access to 

the market as well as regulating the behaviour of actors on them, she advocates struc-

tural separation of platforms from the commerce taking place on them. The platform 

owner is thereby not allowed to compete with actors trading on the platform. Khan 

traces the history of successes of antitrust regulation in the US, in employing structural 

separations in important sectors that exhibited market domination. Since the 1970’s, 

regulators seem to have mostly avoided structural remedies but she feels that these 

need to be brought back if the unprecedented market power of digital platforms is to be 

successfully addresed. India already enforces structural separation between a platform 
and the commerce taking place over it for foreign-funded e-commerce companies.51 

4. Why current approaches fail 

The digital economy is almost definitionally considered to be centred on data. In this 

regard, there remains a fundamental contradiction and lag in current regulatory 

approaches to digital economy, which, if not entirely industrial era, still only focus on

platforms as the key structural feature of a digital economy. Data’s role gets treated at 

best in a secondary and piecemeal fashion, as an add-on to the functioning of platforms. 

Lina Khan proposes the strongest regulatory intervention of structural separation of 
platform businesses.52 But data is discussed by her only in terms of ‘appropriation by 

platforms of information’ about businesses operating on the platform. Such information, 

her paper holds, may have significant competition implications, including being used 

to develop competing products by the platform. Khan argues that although appropri-

ation of sensitive competitor information was always considered by competition reg-

ulators, because of its sophisticated nature in digital markets ‘both the risk and cost of 

information appropriation is heightened’. Herold Feld, who proposes strong action in 

the form of a ‘Platform Act’, is most inspired by regulatory history of media and com-

munication. He compares data with platforms to ‘sensitive commercial information’ 

flowing on a third party telecommunication network, and calls for similar regulation 
for data.53 Focussing on ‘information’ as traditionally understood in business and 

regulation, both these perspectives miss the central, transformational, role that data 

plays in a digital economy. They are therefore unlikely to ensure successful regulation 

of a digital economy that is essentially organized around data.

While still focussed on platforms, recent policy documents in Europe on digital  economy 

regulation are increasingly more attuned to the central role of data. The referred EU 

Report considers data as an important input for online services, production processes, 

logistics, smart products, and AI. It recognizes that there will be cases “where duties to 

ensure data access – and possibly data interoperability – may need to be imposed”. The 

UK Panel argues strongly for data portability and data openness. The latter involves 

data sharing, including of a mandated kind, where needed. 

Being a kind of partial divestiture, mandatory data sharing comes closest to a  structural 
remedy based on data. It has attracted much discussion in the EU.54 Some such regu-

latory intervention is now considered necessary by many policy reports to break the 
dominance of US digital corporations in the EU market.55 EU’s recent data strategy 
paper shows significant progress in its thinking about mandated data sharing.56 It 

proposes a Data Act to be brought out by 2021. But details remain scanty on how data 

sharing will actually be operationalized, and what kind of legislative support it requires.

Effective implementation and enforcement of data sharing require significant polit-

ical will that is taking time to build. It can represent a significant break with the 

 dominant global digital economy paradigm. Such political will, however, is shaping 

up, and may precipitate as digital power concentration causes more and more crises 
in different sectors.57 

Equally required meanwhile are new theoretical frameworks of what a digital society is, 

and the central role of data in it. Sections 6 and 7 of this paper make an initial attempt 

in this direction. The key proposition of this paper is that instead of treating networking 

based platforms as the central structural feature of a digital economy, and data playing 

a part in their functioning, we need to completely invert the paradigm. The central 

structural feature of a digital society and economy is data and data-derived intelligence, 

operating and interacting with various social and economic actors within techno-en-

closures that may be termed as ‘digital ecosystems’. Platforms as networking-centric 

forms are an early manifestation of digital economy changes. They get subsumed and 

superseded by data-intelligence centric digital ecosystems. Any successful regulation 

for the digital economy requires to be built upon this theoretical foundation. 

The rest of this section explains why even the strongest remedy among the currently 

proposed, of structural separation between a platform and the commerce over it, will not 

be adequate to regulating digital power and preventing its monopolistic concentration.

  57  One such crisis is being witnessed in the media sector, where major media organizations are complaining of an

At the heart of economic power of platforms is the network effects based monopolistic 

tendency of any sectoral interaction space or market. This is true even for a physical 

shopping mall as a marketplace. Monopolization by a shopping mall, however, gets 

limited by physical elements of distance, constraints on stores space and therefore 

offerings, and crowds and congestion. These physical factors do not operate for online 

marketplace platforms. With some ingenuity and avoiding catastrophic mistakes, the 

first mover can quickly monopolize any online marketplace. Thereon it can simply 

extract rent from it. Such platform power is certainly a key ingredient of digital power 

(but not the only, or even the most important, ingredient, as data power is discussed 

later in this paper). Transparency and non-discrimination requirements can reduce 

platform rents and power, but not to an adequate degree. These remedies are unlikely to 

suffice for creating platform competition. Even disallowing platforms from competing 

with businesses dependent on them constitutes a temporary remedy of slowing down 

platform power concentration. It does not address it in the long run, because it leaves 

untouched the principal factor of rent seeking arising from very high network effect 

(not even considering, at present, the data factor). Network effect, and therefore the 

rent, would keep rising for a platform that has achieved dominance. Undertaking own 

commerce and self-discrimination are just spin-off benefits for platforms – a kind of 

extra greed. (Although, as discussed a little later, it may be more of a strategy for dig-

ital disruption of the entire ecosystem and rebuilding it in a manner better integrated 

with the platform.) 

E-commerce platforms like Amazon dealing in consumer goods represent the classic 

case proposed for structural separation. Such platforms do tend to enter both the 

upstream elements of the value chain – getting into manufacturing and trading – as 

well as downstream ones of branding/marketing, and delivery. This however is not 

much different from what offline retail chains like Walmart do as well.

Venturing of e-commerce platforms especially in upstream activities of manufactur-

ing and trading may in fact be temporary. Use of ICTs to maintain close process and 

quality control over remote centres of manufacturing enabled IP based lead global 

firms to outsource manufacturing. With even better remote controls possible through 

   19   

advanced data based digital technologies, there should prima facie be no reason for 

digital  platforms to in-source manufacturing. The motivation, it appears, may be to 

force the pace of digitalization of the whole ecosystem. This is undertaken by dis-

rupting activities in different parts of the value chain by setting up own competing 

businesses. The latter are designed to be much more data driven and, as importantly, 

integrated into the data and intelligence systems of the platform company. Because of 

the immense efficiencies of close data- and intelligence-based integration, platform 

owned competing businesses are expected to out-perform the productivity of third-

party businesses that are less data-fied and less integrated with the platform’s systems. 

This puts competitive pressure on these other businesses (even without a platform 

discriminating in favour of its own products in any obvious manner), forcing them 

towards digitalization/datafication and integration into the platform’s data-intelligence 

systems. As the whole ecology gets suitably datafied and integrated into the platform’s 

data-intelligence systems, it may actually be better for platforms to pull out of the 

physical elements of manufacturing (and perhaps also trading), as IP based firms do. 

They would prefer to focus on their core competency of intelligent management of the 

entire ‘digital ecosystem’ and extract profit and rent from it.

This end-state of a fully datafied and integrated e-commerce ecosystem, as desired and 

planned by dominant digital platforms, cannot be foreclosed by simply banning prefer-

ential self-discrimination or even by structural separation, although progress towards 

it may get slowed down. In such a situation, platforms will in any case provide various 

kinds of data- and intelligence-based incentives to manufacturers (and traders) in a 

manner that improves the latter’s productivity and allures them to integrate into the 

platform’s data-intelligence systems. The platform may also create competitive pressures 

for digital integration by first selectively providing such incentives to some manufactur-

ers/traders and not others. Data and intelligence based incentives and relationships are 

complex, and relatively easy to hide from the regulator’s eye. This incidentally speaks 
against the effectiveness of data-related behavioural remedies.58

  58  The referred CCI study wonders why sellers that are dominant on one platform make almost no sale on others, 

which suggests hidden vertical integration. 

   20   

The above analysis applies both to manufacturers and traders on a platform. Data and 

intelligence driven efficiencies among manufacturers and traders of goods and services 

sold on a platform is beneficial to the latter because of reduced price and better quality 

that increase overall sales. But integration of entire activities of actors dependent on 

the platform into its data and intelligence systems is the more important motive in 

the mid to long run. This enables the platform to closely control all such activities and 

actors, and develop strong lock-ins. 

Interpreted in data-intelligence terms, a digital platform undertakes two key functions; 

(1) employ data-intelligence to squeeze new value from various economic processes, 

and distribute a part of such digital surplus selectively among the actors involved, and; 

(2) use data-intelligence to coordinate, organize and control the entire set of activities 

and actors involved. (The paper will be using the term ‘digital ecosystem’ to represent 

such an evolved form of digital platform.)

The ultimate aim is to eliminate independent traders as mediators between producers 

and consumers. They are to be rendered into wholly-dependent agents of the platform, 

who help manage the physical elements of marketing, distribution and sales. Alibaba, 

Amazon’s closest global competitor, in fact does not undertake vertical integration with 
manufacturing and trading layers of the consumer goods value chain.59 It thus already 

maintains a de facto structural separation between the platform and commerce over it. 

But its digital power is no less for that. It accounts for 58% of the online sales in China, 

and its user base is more than US’s total population. On one day alone, on the ‘Singles 
Day’ in 2019, it recorded $38 billion worth of orders.60 Alibaba is among the top ten 
global corporations by market capitalization, and the largest in China.61 It is making 

huge investments in cloud computing and AI, showing what kind of integrations may 

be more important to develop digital power.

After achieving considerable domination of national e-commerce, Alibaba realized 

that China’s rate of growth of e-commerce, while quite sharp, was not good enough for 

how fast Alibaba itself wanted to grow. It decided to expand its digital competencies to 

offline retail. It approached mom-and-pop stores in China allowing them to retain the 
shop-front but taking over their supply lines.62 Alibaba calls it ‘new retail’, an integra-

tion of all retail channels. In this role, Alibaba does not own the consumer interaction 

space or the consumer’s access to the market and therefore is not a B2C e-commerce 

platform as typically understood. But in terms of key aspects of its business, there is 

not much difference in what Alibaba does at the back-end of mom-and-pop stores 

and what it otherwise does in e-commerce as directly a consumer-facing marketplace. 

Reliance Industries in India entered the e-commerce sector without first developing 
an e-commerce portal.63 Building over its dominance in data services, its subsidiary 

Jio Platforms began by providing free or cheap applications that supported business 
activities of even very small shopkeepers, including managing their supply lines.64 

This is very similar to Alibaba’s strategy of supporting small shopkeepers. Much like 
Alibaba’s ‘new retail’, Reliance calls this as ‘new commerce’.65 

The core competency and business of Alibaba and Reliance-Jio here is evidently not 

(necessarily) of directly controlling the consumers’ online access to the market and 

therefore being an e-commerce platform as understood traditionally. The typically 

advocated separation between platform and commerce makes little sense in such a 

context. Things are simply not that linear in the digital economy. What digital plat-

forms undertaking e-commerce really do is to employ the power of data and digital 

intelligence to digitally orchestrate and control the whole consumer goods value chain.

Rather revealing, in the context of this discussion, is Reliance-Jio’s recent sale of around 

10 percent of its stock to Facebook. E-commerce players with foreign investment in 

India have to follow strict rules of platform-commerce structural separation, but not 

those without such investment. With the financial backing of India’s richest business 

group, it was thought that Reliance’s Jio will leverage this major advantage of being 

allowed platform-commerce integration to pose great challenge to the leading e-com-

merce platforms in India, Walmart backed Flipkart and Amazon. The latter being both 

foreign-funded had to maintain platform-commerce separation. In making this deal 

with Facebook, Reliance-Jio chose to forego that major advantage. Most commentators 

think that the real benefit for Reliance-Jio here is some kind of vertical integration of 

its e-commerce platform with Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which is a monopolistic 

personal digital communication platform in India. Such forgoing of the advantage of 

platform-commerce integration in favour of some kind of integration of the platform 

with a key digital communication layer, with enormous data-related implications, tells 

an eloquent tale. 

Food delivery companies present an interesting case of going very quickly from being 

delivery partners of restaurants into ‘manufacturing’/trading themselves. This is done by 
developing ‘cloud kitchens’, where centralized ‘manufacturing’ takes place.66 In-house 

branding may also get adopted. The longer term goal is to fundamentally disrupt the 
food business, including by expanding into new unexplored markets.67 Once such a 

system matures, it is likely, and makes business sense, for digital food companies to 

outsource the kitchen or ‘manufacturing’ part to closely controlled partners. They will 

focus on their cardinal role of data and intelligence based digital orchestration of the 

entire food value chain. (Restaurants too will have a new role in this digitalized food 

sector, while also preserving their traditional attractions.) This evidently is what the 

dominant digital business, normally understood as platforms, is about.

Most emerging sectoral platforms are not in products but services segment, like Uber 

and AirBnB. These platforms are generally not too keen on vertical integration. To 

the limited extent that they have done so, it appears to be for the afore-discussed 
 disrupt-and-withdraw strategy.68 Both these companies have fought legal battles to 

be recognized as pure tech platforms and not primarily engaged in the business of the 
sector that they service.69 This is the exact opposite of vertical integration. Uber has 
resisted repeated attempts to be classified as the employer of cab-drivers in its network.70 

When a court in California devised a test for such a relationship, Uber changed its 

application to exhibit more independence for drivers so that it could retain its claim of 
being at an arms-length.71 How would a regulatory framework focussed on separating 

a platform from businesses offering services on the top of it address the dominance 

issues with such services platforms? 

One can force Uber to give back the power to drivers to fix the price, accept pick-ups or 

not (which any way is generally illegal under most taxi licensing rules), and so on. But 

so potent is the intelligence held by the platform, which the drivers do not have access 

to, that the latter will ‘voluntarily’ accept the services of Uber to fix the price, pick-

ups, etc. for them. That would work out more profitable for them instead of exercising 

blind or ill-informed choices. The same applies to most economic actors organized by 

digital platforms or ecosystems. Distributed intelligence picked from traditional clues 

is mostly just not good enough as compared to data-based centralized intelligence of 

a digital ecosystem. 

Significant vertical, and other kinds of, integrations and consolidations are certainly 

taking place in the digital economy. But these are not of the traditional kind that can

be viewed and regulated either through the marketplace-commerce lens or consider-

ing an employer-employee relationship. Regulatory interventions aimed at separating 

platforms from commerce over it, or simplistically forcing an employer-employee rela-

tionship, are both missing the point. Though perhaps temporarily useful, such measures 

will not be effective in the long term to check digital power concentration. We need to 

understand and focus upon the real nature of digital consolidations, and, before that, 

of digital power, which is fundamentally structured around data and intelligence. 

5. Regulators’ dilemma – To wait or to act now?

The terms ‘digital’ and ‘digital economy’ have evolved over the last quarter of a century 

or so. First it was about society-wide adoption of computers and software services, like 

office productivity tools and enterprise planning suites. The network effect of software 

services was good enough to make Microsoft the most valued global corporation at the 

turn of the century. Then came the Internet companies like Google and Facebook that 

employed the Internet and cloud software to network information and people. By the 

middle of the first decade of this century, people were already excited about an Internet 

revolution, in economic, social and political terms. Software power was superseded 

by Internet or network power. Little did the world realize that the real wonders and 

transformations were yet to come. In the second decade, attention shifted towards data 
and AI. Data power was evident in calling data a new factor of production,72 and data’s 
product AI as being comparable to what fire meant for the human race.73

These heady developments were captured in a series of economic terms quickly  succeeding 

the earlier one – from new economy in the 1990s, to internet economy, platform econ-

omy, digital economy, data economy and now AI economy. Digital power can be con-

sidered a sum and culmination of software power, network power and data power. Each 

of these builds over the earlier kind and subsumes it. We will like to  consider ‘digital’ 

as the techno-social phenomenon that represents this progression – from software to

network to data power – and its incorporation into our economic, social, political and 

cultural systems. 

We are evolving towards a digital society and digital economy, in which data based 

intelligence is the key, and defining, resource and organising force. We call it digital 

intelligence. It defines a digital society in the same manner as industrial society was 

defined by mechanization, and its economic, social and political impacts. Mechani-

zation can be considered as a process of disembodying physical power into machines. 

Digital intelligence, correspondingly, is disembodying intelligence power into machines. 

Its impact on organization and outputs of our society and economy will at least be as 

transformational as that of industrialization. 

It was mentioned how every few years there appears a new name for our changing 

economic conditions; such is the ferment that we are witness to. Society’s economic 

relationships, organization and outputs are undergoing a fundamental transforma-

tion. In some sectors, at some places, these are already quite different from those of 

the industrial age. Urban transportation, travel and consumer goods are a few areas of 

advanced change. Other sectors will follow. Economic regulation therefore cannot just 

be based on the industrial era paradigm. It needs to evolve with the shifting nature of 

our economy; it has to be fit for the digital age. 

How best to regulate an economy that is transforming from one paradigm to another, 

from industrial economy to digital economy? A very conservative view is to wait out 

the period of ferment, till things settle down. Other than the obvious defect of this 

approach of mismanagement of the period and process of transition, the problem is 

aggravated by the nature of digital power. It tends to congeal and concentrate very 

quickly, developing strong lock-ins based on outsourced intelligence (as most activities 

and actors in a sector obtain their intelligence centrally from its dominant platform). 

Such outsourced intelligence based lock-ins are extremely hard to reverse. It may be 

difficult, perhaps impossible, for regulation to impact digital systems to any appreciable 

degree once they are mature and well-entrenched. The current difficulties with regu-

lating Google and Facebook are just a forerunner for what are going to be even more 

   26   

complex and irredeemable situations, as data and digital intelligence become central 

to our economic systems. 

A second approach could be of taking a static, empirical view of how economic organ-

ization and performance are actually visible at any given time, addressing any evident 

problem with corresponding proportionate intervention. It is such an approach that 

is currently most advocated, although actual regulation even as per it remains patchy. 

There are two problems with this approach. One is that digital changes take place too 

fast. And a lot of them are latent, involving building digital presence and power below 

the surface, and therefore not easily visible nor their implications immediately evident. 

This could even be a deliberate strategy by the dominant players. In any case, major 

digital corporations take a considerably forward looking, long-term, view of disrupting 

industrial age systems and building new digital ones in their place. Their visible impacts 

(especially such as can get perceived in a negative light), full monetization, etc. are 

often planned to come in later. This is behind the astronomical investments into digital 

corporations that make little profit or may even be running huge losses, while offering 

free or subsidized services. Such a long-term approach of dominant digital businesses 

blindsides regulators looking to address only immediately visible issues. Considerably 

aggravating this problem is a second one. The regulatory thinking, frameworks and 

tools employed by this still conservative approach are of an industrial age vintage. They 

either render key digital developments even more invisible to the regulators (often more 
than what is visible to the plain eye, not employing the regulatory lens,)74 or make them 

see and address such developments in a manner that is not effective. The stickiness of 

outdated regulatory theory in changed times is most conspicuous in the scarcity of 

appropriate academic work on digital economy regulation. Policy-makers themselves 

are getting relatively more aware of the uniqueness of digital realities around them, 

and their considerable insularity to existing regulatory approaches. They however are 

expectedly not up to new economic and regulatory modelling that requires consider-

able theoretical underpinning. 

  74  Which is perhaps why popular outcry against digital power concentration has far out-paced regulatory responses. 

   27   

This paper proposes a third, new, approach. Our current economic systems still mostly 

exhibit features of industrial age, but what is important to understand is the often 

invisible but very forceful digital logic that is transforming them. Such transformation 

is more rapid in some sectors than others. But it is inevitable in all sectors, as surely 

as mechanization and industrialisation transformed the economy and society. New 

regulatory theories, frameworks and interventions must be designed to address the 

digital logic and its transformational force. These interventions have to be applied side 

by side along with those arising from industrial age regulatory frameworks. The right 

mix will be pragmatic as well as bold and forward-looking. This requires developing 

new concepts, definitions and models of digital economy, an exercise attempted briefly 

and indicatively in the following two sections.

6.  Digital economy as about data and 
intelligence

In examining the transformational nature of digital changes, we can begin with a clear 

empirical fact. Seven out of the top ten companies by market value globally are digital 
corporations, as mentioned earlier.75 Investors evidently believe that the future is  digital, 

and are ready to put their money on it. Every one of these corporations focusses on data 

and AI as their key strategy. Their strengths in hardware, software and/or  platforms are 

all increasingly oriented to this cumulative purpose. They are even ready to subsidize 

these contributing services to acquire dominance in the data and AI layers. Mobile 

hardware is subsidized to hook one onto a telecom service network, telecom service gets 

offered for free or is subsidized to get one on certain applications, and applications are 
free or subsidized to get one’s data.76 Both by the global valuation of companies, and 

in digital practices on the ground, the centrality of value of data to emerging  economic 

systems is very evident. 

  75  Supra n 7
  76  Free handsets for telecom service contracts is the main telecom service model in the US. Facebook sought to 
provide free connectivity for accessing its Free Basics application. So many applications are free because they 
collect valuable data.

   28   

Although still positioning themselves as technology companies, almost all dominant 

digital corporations aim for lead roles in different non-technical sectors. Their plan is 

not just to provide technology services to existing dominant players in these sectors; 

they challenge them through strategies aimed at disrupting the sector and leading its 

value chains through control over its data and AI. Commerce, transport, hotels and 

finance are some front-runner sectors for such disruption and capture, but others 

will follow. 

If not old-fashioned technology support, what exactly do these digital corporations 

bring to a sector, so much so that they aim to lead its value chains? The CEO of 

Daimler – German auto-mobile company that makes Mercedes cars – observed in 

2015 that, more than each other, traditional car-makers fear Google and Apple as 
competitors.77 Traditional car manufacturers have all the industrial expertise and 

IP capital for the auto-mobile sector, neither do they lack in finance. What is it 

that Google and Apple have but traditional car-makers do not, which is so valuable 

in the new era that its possession can take one right to the top of the value chain? 

Technology support simply cannot be that resource of the highest value. This highest 

value resource is the data related competencies of Google and Apple, which can be 

generalized across sectors. 

Daimler’s CEO put it very well when he said that the contest is to be the ‘brain’ of the 

car, not its physical components. Alphabet’s auto-mobile company, Waymo, sources 

cars from Fiat and Jaguar and installs its own computing hardware and software in 
them.78 This quite fits the ‘brain’ analogy. A favourite quote of Waymo’s CEO is: “We’re 
not building cars; we’re building better drivers”.79 This ‘driver’ being built by Waymo is 

machine intelligence replacing human intelligence. Evidently, Waymo’s business is to 

develop mobility related digital intelligence. Similar is the main and defining business

of other digital corporations; building the digital intelligence for the traditional sector 

that they seek to dominate. It has been estimated that, in ten years, Waymo may be 

valued at more than the combined value of Ford, GM, Fiat-Chrysler, Honda and elec-
tric carmaker Tesla.80 This shows what the business of owning the digital intelligence 

of a sector is worth, and how it comes to lead the value chains in an emerging digital 

economy context. 

A digital economy can be considered to have arrived when the digital intelligence 

components of an economy become most valuable, more than the physical and even 

the IP components. (A corresponding parameter could be used to mark the shift from 

agrarian to industrial society.) This is not the intelligence of humans or their organi-

zations, the knowledge capital. This is the disembodied intelligence that is digital and 

inside machines. It has its own (new) economics – with its unique new forms and 

processes of production, distribution and consumption. What is driving much of the 

current social and economic change therefore is the economics of digital intelligence, 

as it was economics of industrialisation and economics of IP in an earlier era (and not 

yet fully superseded).

Without comprehending the economics of industrialisation it was neither possible to 

understand the larger social and political processes, nor – more to the point of this 

paper – develop necessary frameworks of economic regulation. To regulate the  digital 

economy we therefore need to first examine the economics of digital intelligence. 

This requires understanding how control and management of the resource of digital 

intelligence constitute the key logic and force of digital economy changes. And how 

the owner of digital intelligence comes to be at the top of emerging digital economy 

value chains in every sector. 

Rather than digital or even data economy, a more appropriate term for the current eco-

nomic form is ‘intelligence economy’. The needed mental shift to comprehend the new 

paradigm of a digital society and economy is aided if we focus less on data and more on 

digital intelligence. Data and digital intelligence are of course intrinsically connected. 

  80  Supra n 78

   30   

Digital intelligence is insights derived from data; and data may be considered as unre-

fined, or potential, intelligence. An intelligence-centric thinking and vocabulary can 

better help understand the value of key digital economy resources, and how they are 

applied to constitute a digital economy.

People tend to be somewhat blasé about their data being taken. It is much more 

difficult to maintain a similar attitude of nonchalance to intelligence about oneself 

being collected. Intelligence has this necessary actionable element, including of con-

trol, which evokes immediate concern. Data is taken for no other purpose than to 

derive intelligence from it, about the person or the group whose data it is. Shoshana 

Zuboff ’s term ‘surveillance capitalism’ well captures the deeper implications of cul-
ture, power and exploitation with regard to the dominant digital economy model.81 

But the general economic aspects and processes of digitalization may get better 

represented by ‘intelligence economy’. This term is more neutral, and focusses on 

the central resource of a digital economy. ‘Surveillance capitalism’ is an appropriate 

term if the main purpose is to examine and expose problematic digital changes; 

‘intelligence economy’ is preferable if planning to control and divert digital changes 

for the greatest public good. Both terms serve different important objectives. This 

paper’s focus is economic. 

Economic value of intelligence is much more self evident than that of data, as are the 

logic and means of its application in economic processes. One major problem with 

understanding the contemporary digital economy shifts is the invisibility in economic 

and regulatory texts of its key resources, data and intelligence, and how they interact 

with economic processes, reorganising them. Those beginning to look at the role of 

data and its derivatives still largely treat them as a kind of a separate, super-imposed 

layer over existing economic operations and models. This is very inadequate, and also 

misleading, as the role of data and intelligence becomes increasingly structural and 

transformational.

AI as denoting the intelligence factor in a digital economy is also not most suited to our 

purposes. AI gets seen in technology terms (as a basket of human intelligence simulating 

technologies), whereas here we are interested in disembodied intelligence as a socio-eco-

nomic resource and factor, even if doubtlessly a product of digital technologies. The term 

‘digital intelligence’ fits this requirement much better. It stands for digitally disembodied 

intelligence in its social and economic role, as it plays out in the relevant socio-economic 

processes and systems. 

The ‘brain’ analogy employed by Daimler’s CEO can help understand the nature of 

digital economy systems, and the key resource and factor of production behind them. 

‘Brain’ happens to be the name of Google’s Machine Intelligence team since 2010. 

 Alibaba’s cloud intelligence platform is also called ‘Brain’. Its smart city project in Kaula 
Lumpur, and a few other cities, is called ‘City Brain’.82

Key digital corporations are basically aiming to be the ‘brain’ or the central intelligence 

of any economic system. What is Uber to transportation and AirBnB to short-term 

accommodation? It is simplistic to consider them just interaction platforms, which no 

doubt is what they started as. They still depend on that structural position as the means 

of interacting with users, and for mining all the valuable data. But their key economic 

role is increasingly to be the ‘brain’ or the central intelligence of their respective sector. 

Employing such intelligence to organize and orchestrate the sector’s actors and activities 

is what makes them such valuable companies. 

Apple seeks to leverage its wearable devices, as well as mobile phones, to become the 

main health data collecting platform, aiming thereby to be the ‘brain’ of the digital 
heath ecosystem.83 Google is approaching the same goal from the side of generic data 

and AI competencies, partnering with traditional health players to help them organize 
their health data and obtain insights from it.84 Google is also entering into wearable

devices,85 apart from benefiting from its control over Android software running on 

most mobiles globally. Apple is improving its general AI competencies and also part-
nering with traditional health service providers.86 The ultimate objective of key digital 

corporations is to own and control the intelligence of any sector’s socio-economic 

activities, in this case of the health sector. 

Intelligence as a resource has a uniquely centralising quality. On the input side, a combined 
dataset is many times more productive of intelligence than two or more separate datasets.87 

On the output side, since the main function of intelligence is to coordinate and organize, 

one integrated ‘brain’ performs better for any system than it being split into two or more. 

This inherent characteristic of intelligence is the main reason behind digital economy’s 

evident tendency towards rapid concentration of economic power. The intelligence factor 

is even more centralising than the network effect, which, somewhat erroneously, continues 

to be considered as digital economy’s primary monopoly inducing element. (Although it 

does remain a very important one. Also, the two factors of networking and intelligence 

interplay and work together.) Intelligence based  centralization – whereby most actors in 

an economic system draw their digital intelligence from one centrally owned source – is 

much more difficult to reverse than one based just on ordinary network effect.

various actors and activities. Command over the system’s intelligence remains central, 

but next in importance is owning these techno-processes and the rules inscribed in 

them. The two roles are of course connected and mutually reinforcing.

With data and intelligence flowing through them, these digital techno-processes 

encompass huge swathes of socio-economic activity in any sector; going right down 

to  micro-processes  of  production  (tapping  Internet-of-Things  data  along  with 

 enterprise data), surveilling intimate personal behaviour of consumers and other actors 

 (picking data from personal devices), and managing everything in-between (logistics, 

 intermediaries, payments, etc.). All socio-economic actors and activities of a sector 

digitally enclosed and connected in this manner together constitute a ‘digital ecosystem’, 
a term increasingly in vogue.88 

Digital ecosystems represent a very new form of economic organization that penetrates 

much deeper into our social and personal spheres – also controlling them much more 

strongly, even as outwardly it is presented as a set of loosely held arrangements – than 

has been the norm in industrial economic systems (think, huge factories, retail and 

hotel chains, public transport system, and so on). Uber, Amazon and AirBnB are good 

examples of corporations leading digital eco-systems in their respective areas. 

Every corporation desires to be the sole provider of technology and data-intelligence 

processes of a sectoral digital ecosystem. Both digital intelligence, and software based 

rules-of-play, have strong tendencies towards centralising power. However, as digital 

eco-systems are gradually taking shape in different sectors, digital corporations often 

have to enter into partnerships for this purpose. Such partnerships can be oriented 

to complementing competencies; like the Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce giant, 

Flipkart, partnering with Google for the latter’s AI based Personal Assistant, in order 

to counter Amazon’s advantage of linking its Personal Assistant Alexa with its e-com-

  88  Gartner Research defines digital ecosystem as “an interdependent group of enterprises, people and/or things that 
share  standardised  digital  platforms  for  a  mutually  beneficial  purpose,  such  as  commercial  gain,  innovation  or 
common interest”. Bennett, M. (2017, April 12). What is a digital ecosystem, and how can your business benefit 
from one?. The Telegraph. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/ready-and-enabled/what-is-a-digital-ecosystem/

   34   

merce platform.89 Partnerships may include traditional dominant actors in a sector. 

The Chinese company Baidu has developed a smart transport platform, ‘Apollo’, that 
is being partnered by Ford, Daimler, Volvo and Microsoft.90 The threat of domination 

of transport intelligence by Alphabet’s Waymo seems to be a common and unifying 

concern. Waymo has its own partners in the auto industry. After spending consider-

able time trying to develop its own industrial applications platform, General Electric 

brought in Microsoft as its partner, given the latter’s well-established competencies in 
cloud computing and business applications.91 Internal power struggles among part-

ners would no doubt continue, but such partnerships are seen as important to cement 

control over the dominant digital ecosystem in any sector. 

The key structural feature of the digital economy, in terms of its organization, therefore 
is neither the uni-dimensional value chains, led by IP firms, of the late 20th century 

industrial economy, nor the two dimensional cloud based interaction platforms pio-

neered by Internet companies in the 2000’s, that are the subject of some regulatory 

attention of late. It is three dimensional digital ecosystems. The body of such digital 

ecosystems is composed of cloud computing infrastructure and applications, with the 

rules of interaction and performance inscribed in them. And its key flows, and the 

main resources, are data and digital intelligence. Such digital ecosystems will enclose, 

reorganize and intelligently manage economic activities in all sectors, defining what a 

digital society is essentially about. 

The nature of such digital ecosystems – their tight integration, as well as jostling for key 

structural advantages within and across them – is made evident by some significant 

contemporary developments.

The ICT industry has traditionally been a uniquely open one; ‘openness’ being a strong, 
almost ideological, value in this sector.92 Hardware was separate from software, and the 

network from applications that run over it. Those times seem to be ending. So high is 

the economic prize in becoming the dominant digital actor in any sector, and across 

sectors, that, as far as possible, no serious player wants to risk dependence on another 

company for any key component or service. Erstwhile pure application companies like 
Google and Facebook are getting down to manufacturing their own computing chips.93 

The ICT value chain right from computing chips to AI engines is being consolidated by 

many key global digital corporations. It is not just that the supply chain is integrated, 

but components and services are increasingly designed for best optimality within a 
corporation’s own or partners’ technology systems.94 

A strong geopolitical dimension has arisen to this race for dominating and leading 

emerging sectoral digital ecosystems. The US not only banned Chinese telco Hua-

wei’s 5G technology from its networks, it is also putting pressure on its allies to keep 
it out.95 After the US stopped supply of chips for some Chinese companies, China is 
investing big time in chip manufacturing.96 The US embargo on Huawei is recognized 

by many as a tipping point in the US-China tech war, which was building up for quite 
some time.97 In response to the withdrawal of Google’s applications from its phones, 

including Android, Huawei is developing its own mobile operating software, and other 
basic services like applications store and search engine.98

The US and China are said to be engaged in an AI race. Such a description may be 

amiss in pitching it primarily as a technology race. Digital technologies in themselves 

are not that difficult to replicate – relatively speaking, certainly less than industrial 
technologies.99 This is definitely so for a region like the EU with its world-beating 

industrial and scientific base. What then explains EU’s exclusion from this ‘AI race’ 

if it was primarily technological? After all, China has (nearly) replicated US’s digital 

strength in just over a decade and a half, starting from software capabilities that were 

perhaps less than India’s. The more important competence that China developed was 

in running digital ecosystems (cloud applications enclosed data and intelligence flows) 

in live socio-economic settings. Appropriate policy conditions for development of 

domestic computing and data enclosures is what made such live digital ecosystems 

possible. They started small but scaled up fast, quickly reaching a critical mass due to 

China’s large upwardly mobile middle-class. After gaining sufficient size and might, 

Chinese digital corporations successfully went global. Technology developments took 

place largely as backward linkages from such policy enabled business achievements, 

arising from rapid feedback loops and spirals (while not discounting the very high 

technology investments that China made). The failure of EU (and others) therefore 

may be related more to economic policy than to technology. 

Appropriate economic concepts and vocabulary should be employed to present dig-

ital economy issues, reducing reliance on technology based descriptions. The race 

between the US and China is not of AI as much as to be the home of key centres of 

globe spanning digital economy ecosystems – that are configured and led by digital 

intelligence. All other countries face the imminent danger of having only, low value, 

physical economic activities left to them, with their intelligence outsourced to one 

of these two global digital power centres. The economic and political consequences 

of this should be self evident; fears of digital colonization are no exaggeration. Out-

sourced intelligence based dependencies will be much stronger, and therefore more 

exploitative, than those based on industrial value chains. Kai-Fu Lee, AI scientist,

artefacts, and so on. Compare a local enterprise developing the software platform for a ride hailing operation in a 
developing country to the technical requirements for manufacturing cars.

businessman and commentator, says that all other countries will be “forced to negoti-

ate with whichever country supplies most of their AI software — China or the United 

States — to essentially become that country’s economic dependent, taking in welfare 

subsidies in exchange for letting the ‘parent’ nation’s AI companies continue to profit 
from the dependent country’s users”.100

For pressing economic, social, cultural, political and geopolitical reasons, it is important 

to devise ways to effectively decentralize digital power through new digital economy 

models. This requires new frameworks for regulating the digital economy which proceed 

from an understanding of how digital businesses and ecosystems aggrandize power 

causing its concentration in a few hands. The focus of such new regulatory frameworks 

has to be on flows of data and digital intelligence in digital ecosystems.

8.  A framework for data-intelligence centric 
regulation

This section develops a simple model of key activity layers of data and digital  intelligence 

value chains or digital ecosystems, from the point of view of their effective regulation. 

A common way to begin developing a digital ecosystem is by establishing a digital 

interface with consumers through a platform or application that provides attractive 

services in a given sector. These services could be informational or interactive, putting 

consumers in touch with different service providers. Any such platform is sought to 

be scaled up as rapidly as possible. This generally involves inexpensive or free services 

made possible by cross-subsidizing across a two-sided market and/or the support 

of deep-pocketed venture capital. In a winner-takes-all kind of a situation, the idea 

is to very quickly get way ahead of any possible competition. As interacting actors 

leave digital traces of their online activities, the platform in time becomes a  monopoly 

(or duo- or tri-poly) data mine for that sector. Such data is stored and processed over 

cloud computing infrastructure, and insights derived from it, including AI based ones.

   38   

Other sources of relevant data may also be accessed in this process, including through 

partnerships or buying it off data markets. The ensuing digital intelligence gets employed 

to first coordinate, then reorganized, and finally control all or most actors and activities 

in the sector, creating a digital ecosystem. 

Such an intelligence based management of a sector’s activities releases a lot of new value. 

A part of this economic surplus can be passed on to different actors, suppliers as well 

as consumers, to ensure their stickiness. Simultaneously, through gradual tweaking of 

platform rules, and intelligence based allurements, both suppliers and consumers are 

induced to shift their behaviour and activities to sync more and more with the digital 

ecosystem operator’s model. There are behavioural and technical lock-ins involved in 

such syncing, but, in time, the lock-in based on centralized intelligence about the entire 

operations far exceeds all other kinds. Such a lock-in through intelligence-dependence 

becomes nearly irreversible. Accumulation of data and accretion in system intelligence 

keep going up infinitely in quick loops. This is what causes immense concentration 

of economic power with the digital business that operates any digital ecosystem, and 

owns its intelligence.

Amazon, Uber, Facebook and Google are some examples of such consumer facing 

digital initiatives. Another strategy to become the key intelligence player in a sector is 

a B2B one. Here major traditional actors in a sector holding access to consumers, as 

well as to their data, are targeted for data-based partnerships. Alphabet’s DeepMind 

partners with health organizations like the UK’s National Health Service, and some 
hospitals in the US.101 Apple, IBM and Microsoft have entered into similar partnerships 

with hospitals across the world. Both data collection and application of intelligence to 

sectoral activities in such a B2B strategy is done through the partners. The effort is to 

develop deep sectoral intelligence through such means, and then explore ways to use 

it to disrupt the sector and gain pivotal controlling position in its digital ecosystem. 
Alphabet is now also developing direct health data interfaces with consumers.102

The  key  activity  segments  or  layers  of  data  and  intelligence  value  chains  are;   

(1) collection of data, (2) data’s processing over cloud computing infrastructure,  
(3) development of digital intelligence and its centralization or networking,103 and  

(4) application of such intelligence to socio-physical activities and actors in the 

 relevant sector. Digital power is built and entrenched by digital corporations through 

vertical integration (including partnerships based) of these four kinds of digital activ-

ities. This logic of digital domination is largely sector independent. In fact, digital 

consolidation of these activities often extends across sectors. Collection of useful 

data may be cross-sectoral; people’s mobility data or commerce data, for instance, 

may contribute important health intelligence. As intelligence is created, it can also be 

applied cross sectorally in many ways. AI in visual, voice, natural language process-

ing, and many other such areas, is of a generic kind, employed in almost all sectors. 

There could also be more specific cross applications, for instance between mobility 

intelligence and that related to consumer goods, or health. This explains why digital 

corporations are able to develop digital presence and power across sectors. Such pres-

ence and power can be strengthened through partnerships with existing traditional 

players in a new sector, at least initially as an entry strategy.

In order to check concentration of digital power, competition regulators, and economic 

policy makers, need to understand and work on the four key segments of digital value 

chains involving sourcing of data, its cloud-based processing, data’s conversion into 

digital intelligence, and application of intelligence to real world systems.  Various kinds 

of regulatory interventions and remedies are possible that aim at these key  segments 

of the value chain, including behaviourial ones that force certain actions or absten-

tions on key actors. These would be oriented to ensuring transparency, openness, 

competition and fairness in each of the key segments of digital value chains. Interven-

tion could be regarding access to data, something that regulators in many countries 
are actively considering.104 It could involve expectations of transparency, openness 

 (providing  non-discriminatory access and services) and contractual fairness from 

103  Digital  intelligence  may  all  be  pooled  in  one  place,  or  it  can  operate  as  a  distributed  network,  but  mostly  with 

considerable centralized control.

cloud service operators, who provide the infrastructure for data storage and process-

ing. The  processes and economics of how digital intelligence gets developed and then 

applied to socio-physical systems in different sectors is yet an under-examined area. 

But this layer is most important as the source of real digital power in any sector. How 

to make the processes of development and application of intelligence more transparent, 

open, competitive and fair, needs to be explored.

Some such governance and regulatory thinking has begun. It is most visible in relation 

to the layer of data collection and provisioning. There is an increasing accent on eco-

nomic rights over one’s personal data and its portability, and the need for dominant 

firms to share important non personal data with other businesses. In the cloud comput-

ing layer, some work is being undertaken towards open standards, and interoperable 
platforms.105 Promotion of domestic cloud computing infrastructure, including public 
infrastructure, is also advocated.106 As mentioned earlier, economic governance of the 

intelligence layer is much less discussed. Although the general alarm about concentra-

tion of power in and through this layer is the highest; represented in the considerable 

rhetoric around an ‘AI race’ and ‘AI supremacy’. AI governance is still in the ‘harm 

prevention’ phase, as was data governance till very recently. It has not moved into eco-

nomic governance mode. Economic governance of digital intelligence should however 

soon become extremely important as it is at the root of digital power. There is some 

emerging work towards AI transparency, and open AI models. Public involvement in 
the intelligence layer is also being considered.107 

Current explorations around economic governance of data, computing and intelligence 

will be greatly benefited if brought under a coherent framework of defining a digital 

economy, laying out the central role of data and intelligence in it, and examining the 

key logic and nodes of digital economic power concentration. Such a framework can

provide a set of regulatory principles and tools for the digital economy, better predicting 

what kinds of regulation of digital economy are likely to be successful as well as their 

possible intended and unintended effects. 

All the above discussed are behavioural remedies imposing conditions of specific action 

and/or abstention on firms that are dominant, or may tend towards domination. In an 

increasing order of depth of intervention, these could require certain kinds of trans-

parency, non-differentiation, and/or resource sharing. All these are very important 

regulatory tools to be contextually employed as found useful. However, as discussed 

earlier, certain inherent features of the emerging digital economy greatly limit the effec-

tiveness of behavioural remedies since they require constant evaluation of conditions, 

behaviour monitoring, and fine-tuning of interventions. 

Firstly, digital economy changes occur far too rapidly, and in directions and manners 

that are difficult to anticipate. Second, the role of data and intelligence, and changes 

related to them, tend to be rather invisible. They are in the intangible realm in any case, 

but also no forms of denominating, accounting and auditing have yet been devised for 

them, as for instance done for finance or intellectual property. Data and intelligence 

operate behind impenetrable technical walls fully in control of the firms whose dom-

inance is to be checked. Third, dominance entrenchment and lock-ins in the digital 

realm are very quick as they are intense, often irreversibly so. It will be very difficult, 

if not impossible, for regulators to closely monitor what is happening and continually 

attune appropriate remedial measures, all in right time before irreversible dominance 
develops. Various regulatory decisions against Google108 and Facebook109 involving 

fines and directives for behaviourial change, especially in the EU, hold testimony to 

the ineffectiveness of such interventions. These generally are too little too late, serving 

perhaps more to assuage regulatory guilt – or at best prevent some extremely egregious 

behaviour – rather than have any real impact on the ever-increasingly dominance of

global digital corporations. Dominant digital corporations quickly make small shifts 

in their business models, skirting what is completely to be off-limit, but this does 

not affect their pivotal position as controlling the intelligence of the emerging digital 
 economic and social systems.110

Behavioural remedies therefore are unlikely to succeed in containing digital power 

concentration. Regulators must also consider structural interventions that enforce 

permanent ex ante structural changes on economic operations of dominant firms. 

Regulators should have at hand a whole suite of data and intelligence value chains 

related regulatory possibilities – both behavioural and structural. These can then be 

contextually applied in appropriate mixes to effectively regulate the digital economy, 

towards sufficiently diffusing economic power across the economy. 

A recent UNCTAD document on competition in digital economy cites the US tech-
nology law expert, Tim Wu, as suggesting:111 

“...(since) ex post intervention is unsuited to the information industry, a 
constitutional approach may be used to deal with the concentration of power 
in the information economy... “a regime whose goal is to constrain and 
divide all power that derives from the control of information”, based on the 
separations principle, that is, “the creation of a salutary distance between 
each of the major functions or layers in the information economy” . ”

Wu has been an adherent advocate of net neutrality, implying structural separation 

between the data transporting telecom layer and applications that work on such data. 

It was earlier mentioned how, based on this principle, the French Digital Council 

developed the notion of platform neutrality applying neutrality obligations to higher 

digital layers as well.

Governance of information and communication technologies has traditionally 

 followed, as far as possible, a norm of separating key technology function layers; 
whether unbundling the backhaul network from retail connectivity in telecom,112 

and the application layer from data transport layer (net neutrality); or the Open 
Systems Interconnect (OSI) model for working of Internet technologies;113 or sep-
aration of hardware from software;114 or, lately, employing open Application Pro-

gramming Interfaces (API) to separate data based enabling services from business 
operations that use them.115 As digital technologies become the bedrock for global 

domination across  sectors, such wholesome practices are increasingly given a short 
shrift, or get deformed and co-opted in captive technology models.116 Digital tech-

nologies are intermingling with very powerful economic and social processes, in a 

manner that may often render it difficult to see them apart. Governance of digital 
 technologies, especially since the 1990’s, has been largely based on soft law117 and 

self-regulation practices that are anchored in tech community’s ideological openness 
and  collaborative spirit.118 In the current circumstances, upholding public interest 

in this all-important area requires such soft approaches to be buttressed by hard 

law, and its strict enforcement. It is here that the competencies and legal strength of 

market regulators can come to the rescue of technology governance. 

The dominant digital economy model is based on integration into a single entity, or 

through close partnerships, the four key functional layers of data collection, cloud 

infrastructure, digital intelligence development, and its application to various sectoral 

activities. The resultant digital behemoth is what is causing so much consternation

among people, politicians and regulators alike. Such an integrated digital corporation 

is an unsustainable economic and social form. Left to itself, it will suck away economic, 

social, political and cultural power from all sides concentrating it with itself, by owning 
outsourced intelligence about everything.119

Regulators should consider structurally separating the four main functional layers 

of the digital value chain, with a view to check concentration of digital power. Such 

 separation will ensure a fair play for a competitive field of digital businesses in each 

layer. It will mean a plurality of sources and management of digital intelligence of 

our society, providing a variety of options for enterprises, as well as for consumers 

and citizens. 

The tool of digital structural separation should be available to digital economy 

 regulators to employ contextually as required, considering the conditions and require-

ments of different sectors, size of digital businesses, and so on. The objective would 

be to anticipate and pre-empt sector-wide vertically-integrated monopolistic  digital 

ecosystems. The actual forms of structural separations that are mandated may depend 

on many factors. It is possible that separation between some of these four layers is 

sought and not others. Partial structural separation between two layers is also  possible. 

The model of requiring full separations across all the four layers is presented as a 

regulatory ideal-type. 

Some kinds of digital structural separations are beginning to be considered, even if 

not yet formally going under the name of economic regulation. The following three 

sections discuss some such emerging developments, respectively in the data,  computing 

and intelligence layers. It is proposed that these be subsumed under a holistic new 

regulatory framework for the digital economy, underpinned by appropriate digital 

economy theory.

119  See for instance the amount of power Google-Alphabet – the archetypical vertically integrated digital corporation – 
is drawing away from traditional players in the automobile and media industry. And it is foraying domineeringly 
into other sectors like travel, health, employment, and so on. 

   45   

9.  Structural separation of the data layer 

A primary driver of digital regulation has been concerns about people’s control over 

their personal data. Recognising the limits of technical and other kinds of expertise that 

an individual can command, the function of personal data management is being insti-

tutionalized in specialized trustee organizations. Personal Information Management 

Services enable individuals to retain their data and allow specific purpose based access 
to it for companies offering data-based services.120 The concept of consent managers 
proposed in India’s Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 has a similar application.121 

Japan’s Information Banks, set up following government guidelines, not only allow 

individuals to control how their personal information is used for targeting services, 
but also to monetize such use.122 This initiative also promotes use of data by local 

businesses as against data exploitation by world’s ‘Big Four’ digital firms — Amazon, 
Apple,  Facebook and Google.123 

Such an arrangement can be viewed as structural separation of the function of personal 

data collection and management from that of processing data for providing digital 

services. Information Banks, for instance, can be viewed as independent personal data 

infrastructures that provides personal data to a wide range of digital service providers 

rather than such data getting monopolized by the initial collector. Trusted information 

or data utilities have been envisaged, working independently from the firms that use the 
data.124 Some of these are proposed to be run by city authorities.125 Use of such services 

is optional at present, both for data subjects and data-using digital service providers. 

But the viability of any optional arrangement is suspect, such is the all-round power 

of vertically integrated digital corporations (they have many a digital carrot and stick

in their hands). Mandatory structural separation of the personal data collection and 

management layer from data’s downstream processing for developing digital services 

has therefore to be considered, where required.

With consent of the individuals concerned, personal data intermediaries or managers 

may also anonymize data and provide it to digital businesses in a use specific manner. 

In an AI-based digital economy, anonymized group data is increasingly almost as val-

uable as personal data. Privacy rights and economic rights over one’s data do not lapse 
with the act of anonymization; they continue to abide in anonymized data.126 Such data 

should only be used for purposes sanctioned by the data subjects, individually and/or 

collectively. Personal data managers should be able track the use of anonymized data, 

and, if appropriate, also monetize it, distributing the profit among the original data 

contributors.

Significant issues arise about whether personal data managers or trustees should be 

private services, or community or public services. These services certainly require close 

regulation to protect data subjects. This paper will not get into these issues, but they 

are important to undertake further work on. 

Data subjects are not the only sources of anonymized personal data. Many organizations 

may hold it in various forms. Many kinds of data from entirely non personal sources are 

also very useful and valuable. This could be data from machines and infrastructure, or 

other artefacts, or data from the natural environment. Data infrastructures as special-

ized third party institutions are emerging for managing and sharing non personal data 
needed for digital businesses.127 Employing the imperative of structural separation, it 

may be required that businesses that themselves use such data may not also manage data 
infrastructures.128 All those who collect various data – at least the designated important 

kinds – may be obligated to contribute it to data infrastructures. This may have to be

done for free or on FRAND terms129 or through regulated data markets, depending on 

the nature of data, its criticality for important economic and other functions, specific 
costs incurred in collecting such data, and other relevant conditions.130 

Data collection is often intrinsically linked to provision of digital services and it may 

not be easy to separate them. Digital service providers’ access to data infrastructures 

(including personal data services), as well as that of data infrastructures to various 

data collection processes, have to be in real time, effective and secure. APIs can be 

employed to appropriately structure such ongoing access, as per predefined rules. For 

instance, an API of personal data manager can be integrated into the application of 

digital service provider. Personal data coming from an individual goes directly to the 

personal data manager, as per the provided consents, who in turn ensures protected 

use-specific access to the digital service provider in real time. Regulators will need to 

lay down the basic necessary processes and protocols for such purposes, and actively 

monitor them. 

Some basic conceptualizations are required around the nature of data, rights to its 

value, and data sharing. Data is neither technology nor created knowledge or con-

tent. But it has technical aspects, as well as an essential relationship to specific human 

subjects (the most important data being personal or social). The latter, however, are 

normally not the ones who hold and control the data, and may not even have access 

to it. If data is to be shared, how widely should it be shared; just inside the social 

group that is the source and subject of the data concerned, or openly? Should data 

sharing follow the tradition of free and open source software that can then require all 
subsequent derived data-sets also to be openly shared,131 or adopt the model of open 

content sharing whereby various discriminations may apply, like between commercial 
use or non-commercial use?132 Data is different from both technology and content in 

that no creative element is involved. But this by itself cannot mean that data becomes

an unencumbered resource, for anyone to partake, and that no particular economic 

rights exist for the human subjects of such data. It remains inexplicable why no clear 

efforts have gone into developing the basis, norms and laws for sharing data, even as 

it has today become the most important resource, with strong collective and public 

interest aspects. 

There hardly exist any data-related legal economic rights for the data source and sub-

ject, whether individual or collectively as a group. In default, apart from a few privacy 

obligations, data collecting digital corporations face almost no constraint in using 

the data as they wish, and appropriating its entire economic value. Providing legal 

economic rights to data subjects – individually and collectively – can be key to tem-

pering the power of digital corporations. Within such primary economic rights of data 

subjects, various kinds of privileges may be contextually allowed to those who collect 
and process data. Europe had floated the idea of data producers rights,133 and India is 
considering a group’s or community’s economic rights to its data134. Such rights can 

provide the legal basis for structural separation of the data collection and provisioning 

layer (under control of data subjects or their trustees) from the higher layers of data 

and intelligence value chain. Targeting economic rights around key business resources 

that cause dominance has traditionally been a part of structural remedies in regulation. 

Beyond consumers of digital services, such rights of data sources and subjects have 

significant implications for the power of various small economic agents in digital value 

chains. Such actors could be traders on an e-commerce platform, drivers working 

with a ride-hailing company, restaurant owners organized by a food delivery com-

pany, or workers in a datafied manufacturing plant. Access to and rights over data 

about the segments of economic activities directly connected to them can significantly 
enhance their control over their own activities, and their overall bargaining power.135

Collective data rights of such groups vis a vis the platform concerned can perhaps have 

even more impact on diffusing digital power, especially if supported by appropriate laws 

and regulation. Such data rights can provide the basis for effective collective bargaining 

as well as, possibly, such groups’ co-ownership of digital businesses whose main asset 
after all is the localization developed from data contributed by these groups.136 

Data localization has been advocated in many national jurisdictions, ostensibly mostly 

for privacy and security concerns. Behind these more-publicized reasons, (legitimate) 
national economic interests are often at play.137 But these are either not articulated 

at all or presented in very broad and vague terms, without clarifying their basis and 

practical implications. Seen in an economic governance framework, data localization 
can be considered as a legitimate form of structural separation.138 Here, a national 

community asserts its collective economic rights over its data to mandate storing and 

processing of data within its borders. Taking forward the earlier discussion on man-

dating third party data infrastructures, in control of data sources and subjects, it goes 

to reason that such data infrastructures remain close to the data sources/subjects and 

within the same jurisdiction as them. It allows data subjects to effectively exercise 

their economic and other rights over data, employing the power of law if required. 

Data localization reduces the vertical integration of data and intelligence processes 

of global digital giants. The structural separation here is physical, and jurisdictional, 

without necessarily a separation of economic control (which also is mostly needed as 

per the earlier discussion, and is facilitated by such physical/jurisdictional separation). 

It can have significant implications of digital power diffusion in favour of domestic 

industry. This is especially so if accompanied by other elements of digital industrial 

policy like economic data rights, enabling data infrastructures, supporting domestic 

digital industry, and so on.

Physically distributed architectures of data storage and processing, keeping these 

 activities close to the points of data’s origin, is an emerging computing concept that is 
taking a strong hold.139 It can better protect data, safeguard the rights of data subjects, 

and have a considerable impact on digital power concentration. Edge computing is one 

such data processing architecture where data is processed close to the points of origin 
instead of its centralized accumulation.140 Addressing concerns about excessive per-

sonal data collection through mobiles, Google provides federated learning model on 

its Android platform; instead of data travelling to Google’s central servers, it is insights 
from data that are periodically picked up.141 

Such a distributed and federated data architecture can also be employed for  institutions, 
say schools or hospitals.142 Personal data stays within the institution and gets  processed 

there, but it can still benefit from centralized intelligence services that pick periodic 

insights from data stored locally at multiple similar institutions. A private sector initi-

ative in the US offers a platform for collaborative research that is powered by federated 

learning; “a framework for AI model development that enables us to train ML (Machine 

Learning) models on distributed data at scale across multiple medical institutions with-
out centralizing the data”.143 “Hospitals and research institutions retain control and 

governance over patient data and can access a full and unforgeable record of which data 

has been used for what purpose.” India’s National Digital Health Blueprint recommends 

distributed institution-based storage of health data from where it can be temporarily 
accessed as per need, and with consent.144 Country based data localization can also 

be viewed as a special case of distributed data systems.

Overall, the principle of structural separation of the data collection layer manifests in 

the need to develop distributed architectures and independent institutions for data 

collection, storage, curation and provisioning in a manner that (1) strongly protects 

privacy and other interests of data subject individuals and groups, and (2) ensures 

that data required to effectively run a productive digital economy is available in an 

adequate and equitable manner to various businesses and other data users, and is not 

monopolized by a few dominant digital corporations collecting such data. 

10.  Cloud neutrality and open digital ecosystems

Cloud computing infrastructure is what supports data storage and processing. A recent 

article in Wired observed that rather than the Internet – which is based on public pro-

tocols and public interest governance – it is the cloud today that is digital economy’s 
essential infrastructure.145 Clouds, unfortunately, are all privately owned, and extremely 

non-transparent in their operations. On the lines of net neutrality, the article calls for 

cloud neutrality, citing how digital corporations are employing dominance over this 

vital infrastructural layer of digital economy to develop and entrench their power in 

the higher layers. 

A cloud computing infrastructure should prima facie be an inert technical service of 

data storage and computing facilities. But the reality is much more complex, and getting 

further so. The line between an ostensibly inert infrastructure and the valuable processes 

of data and intelligence that run over it is increasingly diffused, and malleable. Strong 

competitors in the higher layers of digital economy therefore try to avoid dependence 
on a rival’s cloud infrastructure.146 It would not be so if cloud infrastructure was just 

like a road on which all vehicles can ply (perhaps with toll payment), or a container 

service providing global shipment, or a telecom network neutrally transporting 

data around.

The kinds of benefits a cloud provider can obtain from another party’s data processed 

over its infrastructure remains a vague area. Strictly speaking, such a computing  service 

should have no access at all to other party’s data, or – very importantly – to any of its 

derivatives. There being no clear economic rights around data, its storage and  processing 

is managed through private contracts. Such contracts may not be able to cover all 

 elements of value that can be picked up from data being stored and processed on a cloud. 

The contract may even be deliberately kept vague to allow room for the cloud provider 
to obtain some data and intelligence related benefits.147 Such contracts depend on the 

relative power of the involved parties, and a lot of services get offered on a ‘take it or 

leave it’ basis. Cloud providers may also make available alluring subsidized (or even 

free) applications to those whose data is processed in exchange for being able to derive 

some benefits from their data. These services can be especially attractive when such 
uses of data appear not to impact short-term interest of those bringing in the data.148 

For example, a cloud provider offering a data-storage facility linked free or subsidized 

application for industrial data of small and medium enterprises, or for business data 
of small traders.149 

Cloud computing providers are integrating AI software into their infrastructure. All 

the top cloud providers, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Alibaba and IBM, have their 

own AI engines. These are available, often for free, for users to employ them to gain 

AI-based insights from their data. While most free AI engines can also be downloaded 

and independently operated on-premises, the computing power required for intelligent 

operations of even ordinary businesses is increasingly likely to be so huge that access 

to cloud computing infrastructure may become necessary. Additional top-up services 

like security, explainablity, data bias removal, etc. get offered, that may become indis-

pensable at least for small to medium users. This ensures stickiness of cloud users. 

But such services generally need access to the underlying data, which means that the

computing service provider can very likely gain some insights from the data being 
processed.150 The cloud provider will employ the old refrain of ‘we will only use such 

data as is essential to provide a service and to improve it’ which is too familiar from 

the terms of services for various personal digital applications. In sum, a dominant 

computing service provider seems to have many ways of deriving benefits from the 

data processed using its services.

The first wave of data businesses arose from personal Internet applications like those 

of Google and Facebook. Their free services attracted millions of people whose per-

sonal data, after a while, became the main stock-in-trade. Amazon and Uber took this 

model to physical sectors, where along with consumer data, supply side data was also 

important. The economy is getting into its second wave of datafication with a greater 

focus on intensive collection and deep processing of enterprise and business data. It is 

here that integrated offers of cloud computing and AI will be key. As most enterprises 

and businesses get datafied and interested to develop insights from their data for more 

effective functioning, they will have to depend largely on such integrated cloud services. 

This is a key piece of the puzzle towards developing captive digital ecosystems. To be 

able to comprehensively command and digitally orchestrate most economic actors in a 

sector, having them on ones own cloud computing and AI infrastructures is extremely 
useful.151 If not among a select few players who own cloud/AI infrastructure, dominant 

digital corporations take great care in choosing their cloud and AI platforms, relying 

generally on very close partnerships.

Such muddying of the separation between the cloud computing layer and data and 

intelligence processes running on its top is a very important emerging means of digital 

power consolidation. Employing free or subsidized computing and AI services, cloud

computing infrastructures are likely to become enclosures for extracting intelligence 

value from the data of most enterprises and businesses.

At the very least, there will the problem of self-discrimination by the player owning 

the computing service layer while also competing, at another level, with businesses 

dependent on its computing infrastructure. This is akin to the issue of digital platforms 

and businesses dependent on them, resulting in calls for structural separation between 

the two. The structural position of cloud computing services is quite like that of the 

providers of essential infrastructures of transportation and telecommunication in the 
industrial economy, which required regulatory interventions including break-ups.152

All this make a strong case for cloud neutrality. A clear distinction, and regulatory 

separation, has to be enforced between the inert pure technology layer of cloud com-

puting service and the data and intelligence systems working over it. 

The recent EU initiative called GAIA-X well illustrates the implications of cloud com-

puting governance and architecture on the higher layers of data and intelligence, and 

thus on the power of digital corporations. Considered to be a direct response to the 

dominance of American and Chinese service providers, this project proposes a federated 
cloud computing infrastructure for the EU.153 With ‘data sovereignty’ as the driving 

motivation behind the project, the GAIA-X initiative is based on the idea that ‘geogra-
phy of the cloud matters’.154 What this essentially means is that if a country or a region 

does not have its own cloud infrastructure it cannot really own its data, underlining 

the nature of vertical digital integrations that this paper focusses on.

GAIA-X project’s approach to addressing vertical digital integrations is to support 

 distribution of cloud infrastructure across many players with common, open and 

public, protocols of interoperability, migration, privacy, security and data sharing. 

 Dominant cloud services and applications thus get deprived of their key power to set 

152  In this same analysis we can also add platform applications like Android and Alexa, and sectoral ones like Baidu’s 

Apollo which proposes to be the Android of transportation.

the rules-of-digital-interactions, which is handed over to neutral third parties. A series 

of such neutral institutions in the form of industry associations and community/ public 

bodies is envisaged in a EU wide architecture. These neutral institutions will, inter alia, 

take up certification. Enforcement of such common rules of engagement ensures that 

cloud operators provide neutral technical services and cannot unduly appropriate value 

from other parties’ data and intelligence processes. 

Cloud services and applications provide the software inscribed rules of digital inter-

action for various actors. We discussed how, apart from command over the system’s 

intelligence, it is control of these rules that ensures dominance over digital ecosystems. 

Such rules may be entirely proprietary of a single player, like for Amazon’s e-com-

merce ecosystem. Or they could be partnership oriented, like for Baidu’s Apollo smart 
transportation platform155 and Facebook’s digital currency Libra.156 Such governance 

structures can be expected to remain closely attuned to the commercial interests of the 

principals. The GAIA-X project seeks to hit at this power of dominant digital corpo-

rations to set the rules for digital ecosystems and govern them. 

Bringing a society’s overall – and sector-wise – digital rules and means of interac-

tion under public interest control, through public and/or neutral bodies, is one of 

the most important imperatives to check digital dominance. Appropriate public/

community roles have to be reclaimed in the new digital institutional ecology, sepa-

rating them from those roles that legitimately belong to the private sector. It requires 

working at two fronts. One is to develop and enforce frameworks of common rules 

and protocols, through suitable governance bodies. The GAIA-X project proposes 
an EU-wide cooperative body for this purpose.157 Second, is to go further, where 

required, putting in public efforts to set up technical and basic services platforms for 

digital enablement and interoperability of all actors, big and small. Such platforms

can be general or sector-specific. The EU is developing platforms of this kind for 
logistics and health ecosystems.158

India has been developing public/community platforms for interoperability and 
basic digital services support.159 It has also been working on frameworks of rules 

and protocols for digital interaction among actors in specific sectoral ecosystem like 
health.160 Indian government has put up a white paper on National Open Digital 

Ecosystems (NODE) as a general framework to regulate, enable and support digital 

interactions and collaboration in any sector. It is based on similar principles as EU’s 

GAIA-X project (which also employs a ‘digital ecosystems’ vocabulary) – openness, 
interoperability, privacy, security and data sharing.161 NODE rules of engagement 

will follow some common principles, which include inclusiveness, participatory 

design and co-creation. Like GAIA-X, it too has a strong accent on accountable and 

transparent, public interest governance for digital ecosystems, that “ensure(s) fair 

value sharing while keeping stakeholder behaviours in check, with both preventive 

and corrective measures laid out”. 

These EU and Indian frameworks represent a very different design for digital  ecosystems 

than the currently dominant model discussed throughout this paper. At its heart is a 

set of public interest rules of digital interactions for all players, anchored in suitable 

 governance structures that are participatory, transparent and accountable. However, 

good intentions, or even project level efforts, including building of a few enabling 

platforms, will not suffice to move the very powerfully entrenched dominant digital 

ecosystem model in the desired direction. Whether the transport instance of GAIA-X in 

the EU, or the transport NODE in India, will govern the transport digital  ecosystem in 

the respective places, or it will be controlled by Uber, Waymo or Baidu’s Apollo platform

remains an open question. Yochai Benkler was rather prescient to, more than a decade 
back, call it “the battle over the institutional ecology of the digital environment”.162 

A concerted and holistic national and international approach is required, backed by 

necessary laws, with new digital economy specific regulatory frameworks and strong 

public sector initiatives. 

Since infrastructural capacities are necessary to have the independence of  managing 

one’s digital ecosystems, also required are considerable investments in building 

domestic data centres and strong cloud computing capabilities. Some countries are 

now  focussing on this imperative, seeing it as an important step towards building 

national digital power and lowering dependence on vertically integrated global  digital 
corporations.163 

Some digital corporations like Microsoft and IBM have less vertically integrated business 

models – focussing more on technology support than leading and managing sectoral 

value chains. They may have a relatively more open approach to globally distributed and 

less vertically integrated cloud services than those like Amazon and Google whose main 
interest often lies in higher, non-technical, digital economy layers.164 Such  significant 

differences in digital business models are important to understand for appropriate regu-

lation of digital economy, and undertaking other policy initiatives. Technology support 

business should in general be kept separate by regulation from various sectoral businesses. 

11.  A distributed intelligence model

Whether governing data or computing, the real implicit target is of diffusing control 

over digital intelligence. Being digital economy’s key economic resource, and factor of 

production, it is the main basis for digital power concentration. Governance in the area

of digital intelligence is still in a very early phase. ‘AI openness’ is a term  beginning to 

be used. However, openness of AI currently relates mostly to the input side of develop-

ing digital intelligence, being mainly about open scientific research and open sourced 

AI software. It is such openness of AI that has been embraced by digital majors, with 
suspicious-looking enthusiasm.165 They have taken their lessons from how open source 

 software was found to be key for building Internet platforms, whereby even the king of 

proprietary software, Microsoft, now evangelizes open source. With a much larger set of 

data/AI scientists and techies getting devoted to collective improvements in this field, 

open sharing of AI research and basic AI tools quickly scales-up general AI knowledge. 

Rapid enhancement in AI science, and general methodologies and tools, is obviously 

most beneficial to those digital corporations that are in the best position to apply AI 

to large-scale social and economic activities, and are closest to supremacy in AI. This 

is why dominant digital corporations are foremost in facilitating such openness of AI. 

While not at all discounting the importance of technical breakthroughs in the  science 

and technology of AI – and dominant players do safeguard some key technology 
 developments for their exclusive use, now or in the future,166 the real contest may lie 

elsewhere. It is in the areas of (1) how much, and what kinds of, data one can bring 

to these AI tools, and, (2) next in importance, how much computing power one can 

muster. Perhaps even more than these, the real trophy comes from embedding such 

AI into real world socio-physical systems in any sector, and dominating them by con-

trolling their intelligence. We mentioned in an earlier section how what is termed as 

the global AI race may really be about commanding globe-spanning sectoral digital 

ecosystems, and not mastering AI technologies per se. 

Two conclusions may be drawn from this discussion. One, on the input side of AI, ‘AI 

openness’ cannot just be about openness of AI related technical developments and 

tools – while no doubt it is very important. It has at least equally to be about open and 

equitable access to (1) data, and (2) computing power. Thus, on the input side, it is

really ‘open AI’ only when AI technologies and tools, data, and computing power, are all 

openly shared, or at least equitably accessible. This is the basis of our earlier arguments 

for regulating the data collection/provisioning and computing layers; and perhaps their 

structural separation from the AI layer being the only effective way to ensure open and 

equitable access to these key inputs for AI. Second, as much as openness on the input 

side of AI, or perhaps even more, attention needs to be devoted to openness and fair-

ness on the output side of AI, which is what has direct economic and social impacts. 

On the output side of AI, openness discussions are mostly about bias in AI and explaina-

bility and auditability of AI. We are still in the ‘harm prevention’ phase of AI governance, 

as it was earlier with data governance (privacy and security). It is only lately that economic 

governance of data has begun to be considered. Even dominant digital corporations 
appear keen on ‘harm prevention’ based regulation of AI.167 What has not appeared on 

the radar is how the gains of AI or digital intelligence get distributed, and who controls 
such distribution.168 The policy and regulatory question that arises is who governs those 

who control the distribution of benefits from AI or digital intelligence, and how? It is 

time for economic regulation of digital intelligence to begin moving centre-stage.

What is economically most valuable are not AI software tools, but trained AI models, 

that have crunched enough data, employing huge computing power, to actually be mak-

ing intelligent predictions and ‘decisions’, acting in relation to real world socio-physical 

systems. It is to denote such systemic operational form, function and impact of AI that 

we employ the socio-economic term of digital intelligence as being the real resource 

and factor of production in a given economic context. 

OpenAI is an organization committed to ensuring safe and beneficial AI that is made 
available to all of humanity.169 It is such distributional aspect of the output side of ‘AI

openness’ that requires urgent focus. When pressed to answer how this will actually 

be ensured in practice, the CEO of OpenAI said, “a utility is the best analogy for the 
vision that we have”.170 This a remarkable approach, as is the overall OpenAI initiative. 

However, AI is not a kind of resource that an philanthropic initiative can just put on 

a free pipe or wire to be consumed directly like water or electricity. AI is a variegated, 

systems-embedded resource operating in complex contextual combinations, differ-

ently for various elements of the digital society and economy. In general, though, AI 

is indeed the single most valuable resource whose possession enables considerable 

control over one’s physical and social environment. Some kind of utility model for 

generic AI services is certainly needed, but also required is to build downstream 

capacities for their systemic adoption and use. 

Any AI utility model throws up important issues of governance of AI or digital intel-
ligence, both harms related171 and distributional. Is AI more like software, and should 

be distributed on the model of free and open source software, requiring all further 

derived products to also be shared on a similar basis? Or, is it more like open content, 

whereby protective discriminations may be applied, for instance, between commercial 

and non-commercial uses, or among different kinds of users? (Many utilities adopt 

protective discrimination, like pricing and distribution of electricity in India.) Or, do 

we need entirely new concepts and models for distributing AI in ways that are most 

beneficial and just? What are the rights in this regard of sources and subjects of data 

on which AI is built? Who decides such issues? And very importantly, who decides 

which kind of AI to spend effort on and which not?

Can a philanthropic approach to managing distribution of AI and its benefits be good 

enough and sustainable? OpenAI has already run into many problems that point to the 
need for larger public governance of AI and its outputs.172 OpenAI realized that being

on the AI vanguard requires mind-boggling amounts of computing power, which is 
very expensive.173 This made OpenAI go back on its plans to be fully a non-profit; it has 

now established a for-profit arm. This move expectedly encountered much criticism. 

OpenAI has also taken in a billion dollar investment from Microsoft, part of which is 

as service from Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure. We discussed earlier the 

problems with such vertical integration. 

OpenAI does not seem to consider that appropriate distribution of an important socio-eco-

nomic resource like AI or digital intelligence requires participatory decision-making. 
OpenAI is in fact a very secretive and closed organization.174 Such depoliticization of 

what are mistakenly taken to be just neutral technical resources (not that technology is 

apolitical) is commonplace in the digital arena. It is perhaps no wonder that OpenAI is 

trying to develop Artificial General Intelligence, as a kind of all-problems solving panacea. 

This underplays context and variability, and is a relatively centralized solution to digital 

intelligence needs of the economy and society. Both technical as well as socio-economic 

feasibility of such an all-encompassing digital intelligence approach is suspect. 

OpenAI is a commendable initiative, especially in highlighting the distributional issues 

relating to digital era’s most important resource. But its limitations underscore the 

urgent need for public initiatives and economic governance frameworks in this area. 

Section 9 of this paper on data governance discussed how federated learning can ena-

ble, say, hospitals to retain their data but share periodic insights from it to build the 
required AI.175 To extend this illustration; the AI generated from such federated datasets 

can be collaboratively owned by the hospitals concerned, and independently applied 

by each as per its needs. In such a model, not just data-based learning is federated for 

developing AI, but also the resultant AI is jointly owned by the distributed sources of 

learning. This may require a third party AI trust, on the lines of data trusts. Such an AI 

trust will employ the needed processes to develop, curate and provide contextual AI 

services, entirely as per the respective needs and demands of the subscribing hospitals. 

173  Computing power used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.4-month doubling 
time (by comparison, Moore’s Law had a 2-year doubling period, Amodei, D. & Hernandez, D. (2018, May 16). AI

This represents an important structural separation between development of digital intel-

ligence and its distributed self-determined use. Traditional sectoral actors –  hospitals 

in this case – will thereby be able to retain considerable independence and power in 

the new digital context rather than being dictated by a monopoly digital intelligence 

owner, as is the case with existing digital economy models. 

In the above illustration, a co-owned institution received periodic data-based insights 

from, and provided the required AI or digital intelligence to, a set of organizations 

undertaking similar economic and social functions. It is possible for the AI developing 

organization to be an independent private business providing highly contextual AI 

as a service. Its sources of data/insights could be the client AI users, as well as others. 

The only regulatory bar on such a core AI business has to be that it cannot enter into 

downstream sectoral services having a direct interface with consumers (like hospitals, 

trading, cab services, etc.). What is being proposed here is a structural separation 

between the AI development layer and AI application (to real world systems) layer – 

with or without co-ownership of sector-related AI by the actors who run the real world 

socio-physical systems in a given sector. 

Such a separation between AI development and application may not be absolute so 

as to completely bar a direct sectoral service provider from developing any AI at 

all. With edge computing, even IoT devices can create and work on their own local 

AI. Sectoral service providers can develop local AI for their operations, but retain it 

internally. Or, they can provide it for a consideration to upstream specialized intelli-

gence businesses – in a transparent and non-discriminating manner. The bar would 

be against such a sectoral business itself entering into the business of specialized AI 

provider for its own sector, or to any other. 

It may be useful to illustrate the practical implications of these discussions: Con-

sider Google to be a developer of generic mobility AI; employing the extensive loca-

tion-based mobility data with it, collecting driving data directly or through partners 

with vehicles on the roads, developing and integrating various mobility related gen-

eral AI like those in the areas of vision, sound, etc., and so on. It would provide such 

mobility AI services to car manufacturers and car fleet operators (like Uber) – on a 

   63   

facilitated, non-discriminatory open access model,176 but it cannot itself enter these 

businesses. Uber, on the other hand, can develop such AI as may be needed internally 

for managing its business of urban transportation (perhaps in a city or region specific 

manner). But it cannot itself become a specialized AI provider to other ride-hail-

ing companies, or to car manufacturers. Although it may supply data/insights/AI to 

upstream specialized AI providers, working in its own sector or others. (There may 

be a separate bar on a sectoral service provider like Uber employing its data/AI to 
expand into another sectoral service,177 but our focus here is on vertical separation 

between AI development and sector-based AI application layers.)

Putting in such circuit-breakers against intelligence power consolidation will be key 

for a competitive, fair and just digital economy and society. Some may argue that such 

measures will reduce the overall AI potency and availability in the society. This may 

even be true to some extent (although an open, competitive ecology may actually be 

more productive of various forms of ‘socially needed intelligence’ than a closed on). 

Society has to make the required efficiency versus distribution trade-offs, much more 

so for such an extremely powerful and inherently centralising resource like AI and 

digital intelligence. Highly concentrated AI power is in any case unsustainable, and 
potentially destructive for all.178 

In fact, in the presented model of separating AI development from its application, it is 

feared that specialized AI service providers may still become too powerful, and monop-

olistic, in owning everyone’s intelligence; even if they are prevented from being able to 

directly apply such intelligence to various social-economic contexts and are obliged to

the backhaul provider and local competitors can provide consumer services. But here we are proposing that the 
‘backhaul’ AI provider is barred from offering consumers services due to the unique nature of how AI operates.

provide it instead to intermediary sectoral businesses.179 To that extent, we may have to 

move to the model of co-owing of such specialized sector AI business through a third 

party trust by sectoral businesses on the ground (the hospitals example above). Or, to 

provide such sectoral (and general) AI through a public utility like arrangement, as was 

suggested by the CEO of OpenAI, but with an appropriate, context sensitive, public 

governance model, that takes into consideration all the complexities of AI provisioning. 

How structural separations are actually sought, for digital intelligence and other layers, 

will depend on the context and need of the specific sector, and perhaps also on the 

nature (including size) of particular businesses. Some kinds of structural separations 

along with behavioural remedies may be preferred in one context, and others in a dif-

ferent one. It is also possible to design partial structural separations. 

The idea is to have a socio-economic model where a society’s digital intelligence is 

adequately distributed, in space and ownership. Such distributed digital intelligence 

can, however, be contextually joined-up and organized through suitable techno-eco-

nomic means to address specific economic and social needs. The system has to ensure 

sufficiently high productivity, as well as fair distribution. Digital businesses have to 

be ordered within such a framework. The system will be designed to have adequate 

interface with regulators, and levers of intervention for them. This will ensure keeping 

it to the canons of public interest, as determined from time to time through democratic 

political processes at different places. This is an entirely different design for digital 

ecosystems than what exists today. (Although one can see considerable shades of it in 

the discussed European GAIA-X and the Indian NODE models of digital ecosystems.)

Market forces by themselves will not take the world towards such a distributed AI or 
digital intelligence model, with diffused digital power; rather the exact opposite.180 

Taking comfort simply from many key actors embracing openness in the lower layers of 

179  Their  key  disadvantage  in  this  of  course  is  of  losing  the  data  mining  interface,  which  problem  though  effective 
data  infrastructures  can  remedy  for  them  to  some  extent.  This  shows  the  complexity  of  digital  regulation,  and 
ineffectiveness of tunnel-view measures. 

180  A distributed AI and digital economy model also best addresses some wicked problems in non-economic areas. For 
instance only a federated social media architecture may be able to suitably address issues of freedom of  expression, 
media  concentration  and  political  interference,  escaping  the  tyranny  of  both  state’s  overlordship  and  private 
 censorship.

   65   

digital value chains, like net neutrality in the telecom layer, open source software, and 

open AI tools, is based on an inadequate understanding of the digital economy. Such 

openness in lower layers is actually useful for top-of-the-value-chain digital corpora-

tions, whereas seeking open access to their main resource of digital intelligence hits 

at the very heart of their digital power. Although currently opposed by major digital 

corporations, even open sharing of society’s data will eventually be most beneficial to 

them once they establish a good enough worldwide lead in various kinds of AI. They 

will ravenously feed on data from all sources – closed and open (more data the better), 

to become ever more intelligent, powerful, and in control. The formidable advantage 

of their large AI lead, and the ever increasingly requirement of computing power for 
data/AI processing,181 would be sufficient entry barriers for any new competitors, even 

if the latter had all the access to required data. On another count, edge computing, 

which is commended for its distributed data and computing architecture, may in fact 

substantially increase the extent of incursion by dominant digital corporations into our 
personal, work and social spaces.182 All this testifies to the need for adopting a holistic 

view for effective regulation of digital economy, which can ensure mutual compatibility 

and reinforcement between different regulatory measures. 

12.  Separate regulator for digital economy

Being based on industrial economy perspectives, current economic governance and 

 regulatory frameworks are unlikely to suffice for effective regulation of a digital  economy. 

New analyses, concepts, legislations and regulations are needed, and also a new body 

devoted to understanding and regulating the digital economy. 

Backgrounded against an analysis of what a digital economy is, how it functions, 

and how digital economic power gets concentrated, this paper described four main 

functional layers of a typical digital economy value chain. These pertain to (1) data

collection and provisioning, (2) cloud computing infrastructure for data processing, 

(3) development of digital intelligence, and its centralization or networking, and (4) 

application of such intelligence to socio-physical activities and actors in any sector. 

Checking concentration of digital economic power requires adequate openness and 

competition at every interface between these four layers. It is understood that, at times, 

vertical integration can have some efficiency benefits, and reducing integration would 

result in losing them. Firstly, such gains of integration may be short term and out-

weighed by losses even of efficiency in the long term as digital competition, and thus 
possibly innovation, get foreclosed.183 Second, digital intelligence contributes such 

hyper efficiencies that it may be reasonable to sacrifice some parts of them for the sake 

of mitigating major harms that digital power concentration is causing all around us, in 

economic, social, political and cultural terms. This is an important political decision 

for our societies to make. 

The model developed in this paper of four key functional layers of a digital econ-

omy can help shape appropriate political responses to undue digital domination. 

Some of these responses may be at a policy level, for instance, making public invest-

ments in all these layers of important digital economy functions and activities, and 

helping develop domestic competencies in them. Openness in each layer can be 

improved by  appropriate policies and programs; like supporting data and  computing 

 infrastructures, ensuring open standards and interoperability frameworks, and public 

provisioning of important or essential services in each layer. 

This paper is more concerned about regulatory frameworks and measures. At the first 

level, behavioural remedies can be developed and enforced for fostering openness and 

competition in each of the four layers. Many current regulatory proposals and efforts 

discussed in this paper can be subsumed and reinterpreted in this four layers approach. 

Developing additional ones based on this framework will also be required. 

183  Stifling  innovation  by  acquiring  or  killing  start-ups  is  a  pronounced  feature  of  dominant  digital  corporations. 
American tech giants are making life tough for startups. (2018, June 2). The Economist. https://www.economist.
com/business/2018/06/02/american-tech-giants-are-making-life-tough-for-startups

   67   

We remain of the opinion however that behavioural remedies may not suffice and 

regulators will have to move towards enforcing some kinds of structural separations 

along these four functional layers. Mandating data sharing, being contemplated in 

many places, is partly in the nature of a structural intervention since it modifies prop-

erty regimes around the key resource of data. It can be interpreted in the four layers 

framework as structural separation of the data collection and provisioning layer from 

the higher layers. Different kinds of structural seperations across other layers must 

also be considered.

A new body is required, in our view, for effective digital economy regulation. It should be 

able to manage the relatively specialized tasks of gathering the needed knowledge about 

a digital economy, helping develop a new regulatory framework for it, and undertak-

ing digital economy regulation. Appropriate institutional developments for regulating 

the digital economy are increasingly being recommended. Quoting the final report of 

University of Chicago’s Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms:

“The  strongest  indication  emerging  from  the  four  (sub-)reports  is  the 
importance of having a single powerful regulator capable of overseeing all 
aspects of digital platforms. Digital platforms generate several concerns across 
different fields, all linked to the power of data. To address these concerns 
in a holistic way, there needs to be a single regulator able to impose open 
standards, to mandate portability of and accessibility to data, to monitor 
the use of dark patterns and the risks of addiction, and to complement the 
FTC and the DoJ in merger reviews. Countries like the UK are considering 
the set-up of a Digital Markets Unit. The United States and other nations 
should follow their example.”184

A Digital Markets Unit for the UK is among the recommendations of the earlier 

referred UK’s Digital Competition Expert Panel. This new Unit is to be “given a remit 

to use tools and frameworks that will support greater competition and consumer 

choice in digital markets, and backed by new powers in legislation to ensure they 

are effective”.

Legislation to enable the required new kinds of digital economy regulation is certainly 

needed. Many of the envisaged regulations in this area will not be possible to undertake 
under existing laws, rooted that they are in the industrial economy paradigm.185 The 

earlier referred EU report on ‘Competition policy for the digital era’ also suggests, in 

context of data governance, the need for new legislation, regulatory regime, and reg-

ulatory mechanisms:

“This, and the concomitant necessity to monitor, may be feasible when dealing 
with a setting in which (data) access requests are of a relatively standardized 
kind and where the conditions of access are relatively stable. Where this is not 
the case, a regulatory regime may be required. This may be true in particular 
where a dominant firm is required to grant access to continuous data, i.e. to 
ensure data interoperability. … A competition authority’s oversight will not 
suffice in such a case.”

“…  A  good  legal  framework  will  take  much  of  the  pressure  away  from 
competition law.”

In addition to cross-cutting regulation, like competition law, some sectors also get sub-

ject to sector-specific regulatory regimes. This happens for sectors considered to be of 

particular socio-economic importance – like transportation, telecommunication, health 

and education. The sector-specific regulation addresses a sector’s peculiar public interest 

context and requirements. Though the digital sector is a  cross-cutting one, it is also 

very special in the way digital power strongly impacts most economic, social,  political 

and cultural activities. It is for the reason of such extra-ordinary  socio-economic sig-

nificance that the digital sector requires a sector-specific regulatory regime – with 

separate legislation and regulator.

Calls for new legislation and regulatory body currently come from analyses that 

have only considered platforms and data related issues in a digital economy. They 

have not yet gone into governance of society’s digital intelligence. Recognition of 

latter’s singular importance is, however, beginning to come about. In such a  context, 

185  It is unclear for instance whether mandating of data sharing will be possible without laws defining economic rights 

around data. 

   69   

new legislation186 and a separate body for digital economy regulation become even 

more necessary.

For the proposed Digital Markets Unit, the UK Expert Panel suggests:

“The role of the unit would have important links to functions and expert 
skills within the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and The Office 
of Communications (Ofcom). The unit could be an independent body linking 
to both, or it could be a function of either.”

An independent digital economy regulator is preferable, linking suitably to the tra-

ditional competition regulator, on one side, and communication/IT regulators or 

departments, on the other. Both these sides undertake vital functions, and contribute 

important governance perspectives, that are required for regulating a digital economy. 

These agencies currently tend to operate in silos, addressing digital dominance in 

quite different and unconnected ways. One side focuses on market power, structures 

and bottlenecks in the new digital context, and employs sanctions and prohibitions 

against market players as required. The other side concerns itself with openness, 

interoperability, protocols for separating key technology function layers, open licens-

ing for sharing software and building applications, and technology infrastructures 

like for computing, data, enabling digital services, etc. Market regulation is based 

on strong legal enforcement whereas technology governance has hitherto mostly 

depended on standards development, soft law, and practice. Combining these two 

approaches under a composite new framework for digital economy regulation will 

provide much synergy. It should be the first step towards an effective response to 

digital power concentration, and thus taming the Big Tech. This paper contributes 

some efforts in this direction. 

186  Due to the evolving nature of digital economy, such legislation can be in the form of a ‘framework law’. The term 
‘framework law’ refers to a legislative technique used to address cross-sectoral issues; framework legislation lays 
down general principles and obligations, and leaves it to implementing legislation and competent authorities to 
determine specific measures to be taken to realize such obligations. Guide on Legislating for the Right to Food.
