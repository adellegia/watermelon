It is widely seen as a serious problem that European as well as international 
customers who have bought an ebook from one of the international ebook 
retailers  implicitly  subscribe  to  this  retailer  as  their  sole  future  ebook 
supplier, i.e. in effect, they forego buying future ebooks from any other 
supplier.

This is a threat to the qualified European book distribution infrastructure 
and hence the European book culture, since subscribers to one of these 
ebook  ecosystems  cannot  buy  future  ebooks  from  privately  owned 
community-located  bricks  &  mortar  booksellers  engaging  in  ebook 
retailing. This view is completely in line with the Digital Agenda of the 
European Commission calling in Pillar II for “an effective interoperability 
between IT products and services to build a truly digital society. Europe 
must  ensure  that  new  IT  devices,  applications,  data  repositories  and 
services interact seamlessly anywhere – just like the Internet.”

It  is  no  secret  that  Europeans  like  reading.  They  like  reading  printed 
books, but increasingly ebooks too. And it is a well-known challenge that 
bookshops  have  to  re-invent  themselves  for  the  digital  world.  Booksellers 
play  an  important  role  in  our  European  societies.  They  are  a  little  like 
friends recommending a good book for you and helping you discover your 
own taste and have a good time reading it. They also offer a nice social space 
where you can find inspiration and peace in your busy life schedule.

My wish is that booksellers in Europe can take initiatives and benefit from 
the growth in the ebook markets. This is why I also welcome this study by the 
European Booksellers Federation. Interoperability is a major requirement to 
build  a  truly  digital  society.  This  applies  to  ebooks  too.  When  you  buy  a 
printed book it’s yours to take where you like. It should be the same with an 
ebook. You can now open a document on different computers, so why not 
an ebook on different platforms and in different apps? One should be able to 
read one’s ebook anywhere, any time on any device.

This study provides interesting insights on ways to reach true interoperability 
in  the  ebook  market,  through  both  interoperable  ebook  formats  and 
interoperable DRM schemes. Now is the time for open standards regarding 
ebooks, just like has happened in other areas of the digital economy.

Foreword

The European Booksellers Federation has been fully supportive of the politi-
cal objectives of the Digital Agenda promoted by the European Commission 
since its launch.

Booksellers across Europe are fully engaged in developing and implement-
ing the new business models that are opening up as a result of the digitiza-
tion of books and reading.  They are keen to meet the expectations of digital 
readers,  as  long  as  copyright,  fair  business  models  and  independence  of 
choice are respected.

The lack of interoperability between formats and platforms has been identi-
fied as one of the major obstacles hindering the Digital Agenda. On behalf 
of  my  colleagues  from  all  Booksellers  Associations  in  membership  with 
EBF,  I  am  very  pleased  that  this  study  provides  clear  scientific  evidence 
that interoperability is achievable. It also shows that there are alternatives 
to  DRM’s  and  that  content  portability  is  feasible.  Booksellers  are  keen  to 
promote  business  models  which  make  digital  content  easily  accessible  to 
the customers they are in touch with on a daily basis in their terrestrial or 
e-bookshops, the European readers.

Equally,  booksellers  are  keen  to  sell  e-books  across  borders  and  make  as 
many customers as possible happy. They strongly support an open market, 
without territorial restrictions, in the full respect of copyright.

It is crucial to preserve a healthy book chain in Europe, as writers, publish-
ers and booksellers are essential in promoting cultural diversity and high 
quality content. It is therefore of paramount importance to promote fair and 
sustainable business models and an even playing field for all book retailers 
in the book industry, and ultimately for the benefit of all European readers.

Executive Summary
It is widely seen as a serious problem that European as well as international 
customers who have bought an ebook from one of the international ebook 
retailers implicitly subscribe to this retailer as their sole future ebook sup-
plier,  i.e.  in  effect,  they  forego  buying  future  ebooks  from  any  other  sup-
plier. In particular, this is a threat to the tight and qualified European book 
distribution infrastructure and hence to the European book culture, since 
subscribers to one of these ebook ecosystems cannot buy future ebooks from 
privately  owned  community-located  brick  &  mortar  booksellers  engag-
ing  in  ebook  retailing.  This  view  is  completely  in  line  with  the  European 
Commission:  the  Digital  Agenda  of  the  European  Commission  calls  in 
pillar  II  (interoperability  and  standards)  for  an  “effective  interoperability 
between  IT  products  and  services  to  build  a  truly  digital  society.  Europe 
must ensure that new IT devices, applications, data repositories and services 
interact seamlessly anywhere – just like the Internet.”

It  is  the  task  of  this  report  to  study  whether  convincing  technological  or 
functional  reasons  on  the  side  of  the  international  ebook  retailers  can  be 
identified  to  justify  non-interoperable  ebook  formats.  Moreover,  we  study 
the digital rights management (DRM) measures employed by those retailers 
and question the necessity to build up additional walls between the ecosys-
tems  with  the  help  of  such  measures.  In  the  process,  we  will  also  address 
the challenge to protect intellectual property adequately across ebook eco-
systems. And we evaluate the potential of the proposal for a common ebook 
format standard covering multimedia and interactivity features, EPUB 3 (as 
proposed  by  the  IDPF  in  October  2011),  and  also  dwell  on  interoperable 
options regarding the DRM protection of intellectual property.

Major players in the ebook market, especially Amazon or Apple, have built 
up closed ebook ecosystems in the last few years. eBooks that are distributed 
via one of these ecosystems are formatted using ecosystem-specific ebook 
formats like KF8 (Amazon) or Fixed Layout EPUB/.ibooks (Apple). As well 
as using incompatible ebook formats, Apple and Amazon fence their eco-
systems with the help of DRM measures of various kinds. These measures 
prohibit the export and import of files to and from other ecosystems. Some 
of these measures are restrictive software-based methods using encryption. 
Thus,  ebooks  can  only  be  read  on  ecosystem-specific  end-user  devices  (or 
reader applications) such as the Kindle readers (in the case of the Amazon 
ecosystem)  or  iPads  or  iBooks  (for  the  Apple  ecosystem).  The  transfer  of 
ebooks from one ecosystem into another is not possible (or, at least, requires 
measures that are not legal).

The main results of our study are the following: 

1.  eBook Formats: Having gone through the features of the different ebook 
formats  (EPUB  3,  KF8,  Fixed  Layout  EPUB,  and  .ibooks)  from  page 
layout aesthetics to multimedia and interactivity, we conclude that EPUB 
3 clearly covers the superset of the expressive abilities of all the formats.

Therefore, we cannot see a technological or functional reason to go on 
using proprietary ebook formats. A possible move from proprietary ebook 
formats to EPUB 3 on the side of Amazon and Apple would be facilitated 
by the fact that all formats have a common predecessor, namely EPUB 2 
(from 2007 on). KF8, Fixed Layout EPUB, and .ibooks do not only share 
the  underlying  basic  concepts  for  ebook  production  and  distribution 
with EPUB 3, but also parts of the data structures. Moreover, Apple was 
actively engaged in the definition of the EPUB 3 standard; with Amazon’s 
KF8, it can be observed that more recent versions converge with EPUB 3 
with respect to a growing number of features.

2.  Digital Rights Management Measures: The general use of EPUB 3 as an 
interoperable ebook format would not in itself lead to full interoperability 
of ebooks for customers. The reason for that is that Apple and Amazon 
additionally fence their ecosystems with the help of DRM measures of 
different types and robustness. To overcome some of these obstacles to 
full  interoperability,  unilateral  decisions  of  the  enterprises  in  question 
would suffice, e.g. by offering data file import and export on the inter-
faces of their reader applications. For others – software-based methods 
using encryption, mostly at the request of the copyright holders – more 
fundamental  measures  would  have  to  be  taken,  including  multi-lateral 
agreements  on  using  compatible  or  identical  encryption  solutions,  e.g. 
open (source) solutions. 

To sum up, there is no technical or functional reason not to use and establish 
EPUB 3 as an/the interoperable (open) ebook format standard. One short-
term obstacle is the non-availability of reader applications able to display all 
EPUB 3 features. However, this problem should be fixed soon by the IDPF 
Readium initiative which is developing an open source reference system and 
rendering engine for EPUB 3. Given the will to do so on the side of Amazon 
and Apple, the DRM barrier between the ecosystems could be partly over-
come  by  simple  changes  to  the  respective  store  and  reader  applications, 
and partly only by more demanding agreements between different players 
on  interoperable  DRM  solutions.  The  latter  is  only  necessary  if  copyright 
holders continue insisting on having their intellectual property protected by 
highly restrictive measures.

1  Introduction
Major  players  in  the  ebook  market  like  Amazon  or  Apple  have  built  up 
closed ecosystems for ebooks in the last few years. In such closed ecosystems, 
readers can import ebooks or buy ebooks from the ebook stores available, 
but  no  platform-independent  use  or  reading  of  ebooks  is  possible,  as  it  is 
impossible or at least difficult to export ebooks. As well as the impossibility 
of exporting ebooks, other instruments for building up closed ecosystems 
are  a  tight  coupling  between  reading  devices  and  the  store,  proprietary 
digital rights management (DRM) protection, and/or the use of proprietary 
and  incompatible  ebook  formats.  Examples  of  ecosystem-specific  ebook 
formats are KF8 by Amazon or Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks by Apple.

Non-interoperable ebook formats cause various problems for customers as 
the  making  available  and  reading  of  ebooks  becomes  ecosystem-specific. 
For  example,  ebooks  that  are  provided  by  Amazon  can  only  be  read  and 
used on Amazon devices (and reading apps); analogously, reading an ebook 
from  Apple’s  iBookstore  on  Amazon’s  Kindle  reader  is  impossible  due  to 
the  non-interoperability  of  the  formats.  The  transfer  of  ebooks  from  one 
ecosystem into another is not possible (or, at least, requires illegal measures) 
for customers. Therefore, buying books in different ecosystems and viewing 
them  with  the  same  reader  becomes  impossible.  The  existence  of  closed 
ecosystems in the ebook market also causes problems for local bookstores 
and other online retailers which deliver ebooks using interoperable formats. 
Customers  with  Amazon’s  Kindle  readers  can  only  read  ebooks  bought 
from the Amazon Kindle Store. Therefore, not only is there no free choice 
of online bookseller, but it is impossible to buy ebooks at local bookstores 
or  other  online  retailers  as  the  Kindle  reader  can  only  process  ebooks  in 
Amazon’s KF8 format, which cannot be provided by the local bookseller or 
other online retailers.

Besides incompatible formats, ebook resellers use proprietary DRM meas-
ures to prohibit the free exchange of ebooks between different ecosystems 
and  to  protect  their  own  ecosystem.  Therefore,  ecosystem-specific  and 
proprietary  DRM  measures  have  the same  function  as incompatible  book 
formats  as  they  restrict  the  access  to  book  content  to  customers  of  one 
ecosystem. Given his/her specific device, a customer can only buy ebooks 
that are available in the ecosystem to which his/her end-user device belongs. 
For  example,  although  Apple  uses  an  interoperable  ebook  format  (EPUB) 
for  some  of  its  content,  the  owner  of  an  Apple  reading  device  (e.g.  iPad) 
cannot transfer his/her DRM-protected ebooks from his/her reading device 
to a non-Apple reading device, as Apple’s DRM system (Apple FairPlay) is 
proprietary and does not allow the export of ebooks.

The existence of closed ecosystems is also an obstacle to the accessibility of 
ebooks. As the content available in a particular ecosystem is only a subset 
of all available books, accessibility is limited to those books that are offered 
in the ecosystem to which a particular reader belongs. eBooks that are only

available in other ecosystems are not accessible by a reader. This is especially 
the case for self-published books as the terms of use of some ebook stores 
(e.g.  Amazon’s  Kindle  Direct  Publishing  Program)  explicitly  forbid  an 
author to offer his/her book at a different store for a limited period of time. 
A comparison of the Amazon and Apple ebook stores reveals that Amazon 
offers more ebooks than Apple, and the average prices of ebooks offered in 
the Amazon Kindle Store are lower than in the Apple iBookstore. The price 
difference illustrates the different choices offered by the two ebook stores. 
The  higher  price  is  a  result  of  Apple’s  strict  control  of  the  ebooks  offered 
in  its  store  and  its  stronger  focus  on  high-quality  and  graphic-oriented 
ebooks. The incompatibility of the ecosystems limits the choice of ebooks 
for  readers,  who  have  only  the  portfolio  of  the  ecosystems  to  which  their 
reader belongs at their disposal.

The European Union is aware of the problems arising from the non-interop-
erability of formats. In pillar II of the Digital Agenda (interoperability and 
standards), the European Commission calls for an “effective interoperability 
between  IT  products  and  services  to  build  a  truly  digital  society.  Europe 
must ensure that new IT devices, applications, data repositories and services 
interact seamlessly anywhere – just like the Internet.”

The goal of this study is to examine the technical and functional possibilities 
of an interoperable “cross-ecosystem” ebook format. An obvious candidate 
for such an interoperable format is EPUB 3, as proposed by the International 
Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) in October 2011. However, to reach true 
interoperability  in  the  ebook  market,  interoperable  ebook  formats  are 
not  enough:  the  technical  DRM  measures  used  by  the  retailers  must  also 
be  interoperable.  DRM  becomes  relevant  if  players  in  the  bookmarket 
(typically  publishers)  want  to  protect  their  content  using  organisational 
or technical measures. With this in mind, we examine whether the DRM 
schemes used in the different ecosystems allow for interoperability. To reach 
true interoperability in the ebook market, interoperable ebook formats and 
interoperable DRM schemes are necessary.

Our definition of interoperability is that ebooks bought via different chan-
nels or in different ecosystems can be read using the same reader software 
or  application,  including  using  its  administration  and  social  reading 
functionalities.  Interoperability  does  not  occur  if  the  reading  of  different 
books requires the use of different reader applications, even if they run on 
the  same  (hardware)  device.  Likewise,  interoperability  is  not  fulfilled  if 
conversion tools allow authors to cross-publish ebooks in different ecosys-
tems.  For  example,  Amazon’s  KindleGen  software  converts  EPUB  ebooks 
into  Amazon’s  KF8  format. The  result  is  two  different  ebooks  that  can  be 
distributed  in  different  ecosystems.  Moreover,  this  option  only  applies  to 
EPUB ebooks with features that are also supported by KF8. This is a serious 
restriction, since EPUB 3 provides more features to the author than KF8.

2  Development of EPUB
This section gives a brief outline of the development of the EPUB standard. 
Other competing standards like KF8 and .ibooks are discussed in Sects. 3.2 
and 3.3.

The  standardization  of  ebook  formats  goes  back  to  1998,  when  the  Open 
Ebook  Authoring  Group  was  founded  during  the  very  first  conference 
dedicated  to  ebooks,  organized  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards 
and  Technology.  The  goal  of  this  working  group  was  to  develop  an  open 
industry ebook standard based on XML, which would allow the platform-
independent use of ebooks. Platform-independence became a relevant issue 
as the reference standard PDF was a good choice for displaying ebooks on 
desktop  computers.  However,  it  was  inappropriate  for  displaying  ebooks 
on mobile handhelds like Palm or Blackberry which became popular at the 
end of the 90s. Such devices have small displays of varying size and much 
lower computing power and memory. Consequently, the new ebook stand-
ard  should  have  been  platform-independent,  reflected  established  content 
format  standards,  and  served  as  a  reference  for  content  providers  and 
device manufacturers. In 1998, the working group started with 25 members 
ranging from producers of handhelds and computers to large IT companies 
like Microsoft, Adobe and Nokia. In 1999, the working group was renamed 
in “Open eBook Forum”1. The first product of the working group was the 
Open eBook Publication Structure (OEBPS or OeB) 1.0, which was released 
in 1999. Revisions of the standard were published in June 2001 as version 
1.0.1  and,  with  only  minor  changes,  in  August  2002  as  version  1.2.  This 
version of the standard already allowed a separation of content and layout 
by the use of cascading style sheets (CSS).

In 2005, the Open eBook Forum changed its name to “International Digital 
Publishing Forum” (IDPF). The motivation for the change was the growing 
and changing ebook market with new players like libraries, publishers, or 
booksellers and the need for a support of various business models. A major 
problem of OEBPS 1.2 was the missing support of distribution and interac-
tion with end-users. The 1.2 standard specified the input format for ebooks, 
but all output formats which are used for the delivery of the books to the 
customer were proprietary. Len Kawell, president of Glassbook, a company 
which was purchased by Adobe in 2000, already complained in 1999 that 
“the OEBPS 1.0 standard only covers the format of the content, not a copy-
right protection and distribution specification. Thus, Glassbook [like other 
companies] was working on an own standard [EBX] covering this area” [15]. 
Most  of  these  proprietary  early  ebook  standards  used  OEBPS  (version  1.0 
with  minor  changes)  on  the  production  side,  however,  they  extended  the 
standard on the distribution side with functionalities like compression or 
proprietary binary codes. Other examples for distribution extensions of the

In 2013, the working group is still active in the development of open ebook standards with 
more than 170 members including booksellers and publishers like Random House USA, 
Holtzbrinck (USA), and Barnes & Noble, but also IT companies like Apple or Sony [12].

OEBPS are the LIT format developed by Microsoft or the MOBI format from 
the French company Mobipocket SA (Sect. 3.3). However, these proprietary 
extensions  and  developments  were  not  in  line  with  the  goal  of  the  IDPF, 
which  wanted  to  define  a  standard  covering  all  areas  ranging  from  the 
production and distribution to the end customer. Thus, in 2005, the IDPF 
founded a working group named OEBPS Container Format Working Group 
to develop a container format that was able to bundle the ebook files in such 
a way that was also appropriate for distribution.

An  important  stage  of  the  development  was  reached  in  September  2007, 
when EPUB 2.0 became the official standard of the IDPF and replaced the 
older  OEBPS  1.2.  A  maintenance  update  (EPUB  2.0.1)  was  published  in 
September 2010. EPUB 2.0.1 consists of three parts: 

•	

•	

•	

the Open Publication Structure (OPS) 2.0.1, which describes the format-
ting of the content, 

the Open Packaging Format (OPF) 2.0.1, which defines the structure of 
the XML document, and 

the Open Container Format (OCF) 2.0.1, which compresses the files as a 
ZIP archive. 

In contrast to OEBPS 1.2, which uses only a subset of XHTML2, OPS 2.0.1 
uses  XHTML  1.1  for  defining  the  text  and  structure  of  the  content3.  For 
layout and design, OPS 2.0.1 uses a subset of CSS 2.0 combined with some 
book-specific  extensions.  Furthermore,  it  supports  vector  graphics  like 
PNG, JPEG, GIF, or SVG. The OPF 2.0.1 part defines the book metadata, the 
file manifest (list of all files), and the linear reading order (specified in an 
XML file with the .opf extension). In addition, it specifies the hierarchical 
table of contents in an XML file with the .ncx extension. Finally, OCF 2.0.1 
defines how the files and directory structure defined by OPS and OPF are 
compressed in a single ZIP file with the extension .pub.

As EPUB 2.0.1 was designed for text-centric books, a variable-width layout is 
the only option for the display of an ebook. A variable-width layout adapts the 
appearance of the book to the size of the screen, allowing the reader to view an 
ebook on a variety of different end-user devices with different screen sizes. EPUB 
2.0.1 did not allow publishers to design ebooks with fixed-width layout, which 
should look exactly the same on different devices. Fixed layouts are important 
for graphic-centered books like cookbooks or children’s books. Furthermore, 
EPUB  2.0.1  lacked  any  specifications  for  annotations  and  linking  in  ebooks. 
Thus, the usage of ebooks in an educational context was difficult as interaction 
between different readers or between readers and publisher was limited.

The drawbacks of EPUB 2.0.1 (only limited support of multimedia and interac-
tivity) have been addressed by the EPUB 3 specification, which was approved 

2  XHTML is the XML version of HTML.

In addition, OPS 2.0.1 also allows the use of the DTBook format, which is an XML standard 
designed for the needs of visually impaired people.

as an official IDPF standard in October 2011. In March 2013, the International 
Publishers  Association  (IPA)  recognized  EPUB  3  as  the  preferred  standard 
format and recommended that publishers should use this standard for ebooks. 
EPUB 3 consists of four specifications: 

•	 EPUB  Publications  3.0,  which  defines  the  semantics  and  overarching

3  eBook Formats
All  current  major  ebook  formats  are  descendants  of  the  earlier  standards 
OEBPS  or  EPUB  2.0.1;  this  is  obviously  true  for  EPUB  3,  but  also  for 
Amazon’s  KF8  format  (Sect.  3.3),  which  was  announced  in  2011  with  the 
release of the Kindle Fire. The KF8 format is based on the proprietary AZW 
format, which is a compressed Mobipocket format. The Mobipocket format 
itself is based on OEBPS combined with XHTML, JavaScript, and Frames. 
It was developed by the French company Mobipocket SA, which was pur-
chased by Amazon in 2005.

The  formats  used  by  Apple  also  originate  from  the  earlier  EPUB  standards. 
However,  Apple’s  developments  of  its  own  proprietary  formats  (Apple  Fixed 
Layout EPUB and .ibooks; see Sect. 3.2) were mainly motivated by the deficits of 
the EPUB 2.0.1 standard. Consequently, Apple was actively engaged in the defi-
nition of the EPUB 3 standard and all relevant features of Apple Fixed Layout 
EPUB and .ibooks can also be found in EPUB 3. For example, the underlying 
basic concepts for ebook production and distribution as well as large parts of the 
used data structures are similar or identical [11, 17].

The following sections give a brief overview of the major ebook formats and 
standards.  In  particular,  we  focus  on  the  open  EPUB  3  standard  and  the 
proprietary  .ibooks  (Apple),  Apple  Fixed  Layout  EPUB  (Apple),  and  KF8 
(Amazon) formats.

3.1  EPUB 3

The technologies used in EPUB 2.0.1 (HTML4 and CSS2) allow authors to 
publish text-heavy publications as ebooks. However, the creation of multi-
media or interactive ebooks was very limited. These deficits are addressed 
by EPUB 3, which is based on HTML5 and CSS3 allowing the creation of 
multimedia  ebooks,  books  with  complex  layout,  mathematical  formulae, 
and interactive  features.  EPUB 3 also introduces functionalities like fixed 
layout,  non-linear  documents,  or  text-to-speech.  Different  from  EPUB 
2.0.1, the new standard also allows authors to use scripting languages like 
JavaScript, which makes ebooks more interactive and more like programs 
than static books.

EPUB  3  heavily  relies  on  HTML5  and  XHTML5,  respectively.  HTML  is 
the  core technology for all current websites with HTML 2.0 standardized 
almost 20 years ago in 1995. The new standard HTML5 replaced the older 
HTML 4.01 specification from 1999. XHTML1 (published in 2002) and its 
successor XHTML5 (published along with HTML5), are the XML variants 
of  the  corresponding  HTML  4.01  and  HTML5  specifications.  Different 
from  HTML,  which  uses  a  markup  language  for  describing  documents, 
the XHTML specifications describe web documents using an XML syntax. 
Using the XML specification, XHTML makes the automated processing of 
documents easier. As of December 2012, HTML5 became a W3C Candidate

Recommendation; the W3C is planning to release a stable HTML5 recom-
mendation  by  the  end  of  2014.  Although  the  standardization  process  of 
HTML5 is not yet finished, most parts of the specification are stable and all 
relevant web browsers and many ebook viewers have already implemented 
large parts of the standard.

The stronger capabilities of EPUB 3 in comparison to EPUB 2 mainly come 
from the use of HTML5 and CSS3. Highlights of HTML5 are new elements 
like  audio,  video,  canvas  (drawing  on  the  fly),  the  inline  use  of  scalable 
vector  graphics  and  mathematical  expressions  (MathML),  new  types  of 
form controls, and the removal of many deprecated elements. This leads to 
the following new features of EPUB 3 [7]: 

•	 The  required  schema  for  EPUB  3  content  documents  changed  from 
XHTML 1.1 to XHTML54. With this version change, ebooks can contain 
videos  and  audios  as  well  as  graphics,  which  can  be  drawn  on  the  fly 
using JavaScript. 

•	 EPUB 3 uses a large set of modules from CSS3, instead of only CSS 2.1 
as in EPUB 2.0.1. CSS is used for describing the format and appearance 
of an ebook. 

•	 Interactivity in ebooks becomes possible by the use of JavaScript. 

•	 The addition of MathML to HTML5 allows the usage of mathematical 

expressions in ebooks. 

•	 Scalable vector graphics, which can be easily adjusted to different sizes 
and resolutions of end-user devices, became a standard content type. 

•	 All  EPUB  3  viewers  must  support  and  show  embedded  fonts.  EPUB  3 
also supports non-Western writing modes and scripts, including vertical 
layout in Japanese and other Asian scripts. 

•	 The  new  specification  EPUB  Media  Overlays  3.0  allows  synchronized 
audio  narration.  Media  overlay  documents  define  the  timing  for  the 
pre-recorded  audio  narration  and  how  it  relates  to  the  EPUB  Content 
Document markup. 

With EPUB 3, the use of audio and video files is possible using the HTML5 
elements <audio> and <video>. Although different audio and video formats 
are  specified,  not  all  reading  devices  support  all  possible  formats.  Thus, 
EPUB 3 defines core media types which must be supported by all EPUB 3 
compatible  reading  devices  and  software  readers.  Standards  for  audio  are 
mp3 and AAC LC in mp4 containers; for video, H.264 and WebM are sug-
gested formats.

The  HTML5  element  <script>  allows  authors  to  use  JavaScript  in  ebooks. 
By using JavaScript, dynamic elements like pop-ups or animations as well 
as interactive elements such as forms become possible. In combination with 

4  XHTML5 is the XML variant of HTML5.

the HTML5 element <aside>, the text flow can become non-linear which is 
an interesting option for side notes, footnotes, or pop-ups. Although EPUB 
3  allows  the  use  of  scripting,  it  does  not  standardize  (in  relation  to  the 
core media types for multimedia content) the use of JavaScript elements in 
ebooks. The missing recommendation can easily lead to proprietary exten-
sions  as  well  as  incompatible  EPUB  3  readers  that  support  a  different  or 
incompatible subset of scripting elements.

HTML5 allows authors to introduce new forms of interaction. For example, 
forms allow publishers to establish a feedback channel for their customers. 
If the end-user device has a GPS receiver or similar location device (which 
is, for example, the case for many mobile phones), the geographic position 
of  the  reader  can  be  used  for  location-aware  services.  Another  element 
<canvas>  can  be  used  for  drawing  on  the  fly  animations  like  bitmaps  or 
vector graphics as well as movies on a separate pane. Like video and audio, 
this  powerful  feature  of  EPUB  3  is  not  relevant  for  digital-ink  readers 
(e.g. the majority of Kindle readers), as such end-user devices are not able to 
show animated graphics or movies.

In EPUB 2.0.1, OPF 2.0.1 specified the hierarchical table of contents in an 
XML  file  with  the  .ncx  extension.  However,  this  standard  was  not  very 
reader-friendly and difficult to use. Thus, EPUB 3 dropped this specification 
and uses instead the HTML5 element <nav> not only for navigation and the 
table of contents, but also for lists of tables and lists of figures. Lists defined 
using <nav> are easier to read and interpret by humans.

For layout and design, the EPUB Content Documents 3.0 specification fully 
supports CSS 2.1 (same as EPUB 2.0.1) and also some additional elements 
of CSS3. New modules defined by CSS3 and supported by EPUB 3 are the 
Speech Module5 and Media Queries6. The Speech Module enables authors to 
control the rendering of documents via speech synthesis and provides addi-
tional text-to-speech enhancement functionalities. For example, it allows a 
reader to control the speech pitch and rate, sound levels, or text-to-speech 
voices. These stylesheet properties can be used together with visual proper-
ties (mixed media as defined in EPUB Media Overlays 3.0), or as a complete 
aural alternative to a visual presentation. CSS Media Queries allow authors 
to define different blocks of CSS code for different screen sizes. Thus, ebook 
content can be properly presented on end-user devices with different resolu-
tions. Examples are the presentation of side notes next to the regular text 
on large displays (similar to printed books) versus their integration into the 
regular text using separate boxes on small displays like mobile phones. For 
digital-ink  displays,  additional  boxes  can  be  drawn  around  the  side  notes 
as such displays cannot display different colours, but only black and white.

Since March 2012, EPUB 3 has included a fixed-layout option for ebooks. 
This feature allows authors to define a static format for ebooks, which does

not  adjust  to  the  dimensions  of  the  end-user  device.  This  mechanism  to 
express the intended rendering dimensions of an ebook is essential for the 
design of graphic-oriented ebooks like children’s books or, in general, books 
in which content and design are so intertwined they cannot be separated. 
The use of different but connected layers for graphics and underlying text 
still makes Fixed Layout ebooks full text searchable and allows readers to 
make use of the text-to-speech functionalities provided by EPUB 3.

Although  EPUB  3  includes  all  features  that  allow  the  creation  of  enhanced 
ebooks with interactive and multimedia content, not all booksellers immedi-
ately used EPUB 3 as the distribution format for their books. An obstacle to the 
use of the new EPUB 3 standard has been the absence of a fully EPUB 3-com-
patible ebook reader. Thus, in February 2012 the IDPF together with the Open 
Source project WebKit (which is a widely used open source HTML5 rendering 
engine) and other partners like Adobe, Google, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, O’Reilly, 
Samsung  and  Sony  started  to  develop  Readium7,  an  open  source  reference 
system and rendering engine for EPUB 3. The goal of the project is to build a 
reference system for rendering EPUB 3 publications, which can easily be used 
by different ebook readers. Currently, the core EPUB 3 features are supported, 
while some others like Media Overlays or text-to-speech are still missing8. Stable 
releases of Readium are currently available for Google’s Chrome browser. Other 
(proprietary) readers that support parts of the EPUB 3 standard are available 
from Apple, whose iBooks reading software (Sect. 3.2) supports large parts of 
the EPUB 3 standard, or from Ingram’s VitalSource Bookshelf platform9 (who 
had already claimed in 2012 that its software reader, which is available for all 
major platforms, fully supports EPUB 3). We expect that the majority of ebook 
retailers will have their e-reading software fully support EPUB 3 by the end of 
2013. This is, for example, the case with the ebook retailer Kobo, who plan to 
fully support EPUB 3 by the third quarter of 201310.

3.2  Apple’s eBook Formats

In  January  2010,  Apple  announced  the  iPad  together  with  iBooks,  which 
is  an  application  for  viewing  EPUB  (version  2.0.1)  and  PDF  ebooks  on 
Apple  devices.  In  April  2010,  iBooks  1.1  became  available  for  the  iPhone 
and iPod Touch running iOS 4. Six months later in December 2010, Apple 
released iBooks 1.2 including a new format, the Apple Fixed Layout EPUB 
(Sect. 3.2.1). Like the fixed-layout feature of EPUB 3 (introduced in March 
2012), this feature allows the creation of ebooks where content and layout 
cannot  be  separated.  Typical  examples  are  cookbooks,  travel  books,  pho-
tography books, or children’s books. The Apple Fixed Layout EPUB format 
is available for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch running Apple’s iOS 4 or later.

It is not available on earlier versions of iOS or on other EPUB-compatible 
ebook  readers.  In  January  2012,  together  with  the  2.0  version  of  iBooks, 
which  allows  ebooks  to  include  interactive  diagrams,  audios  and  videos, 
Apple  also  released  the  authoring  tool  iBooks  Author  (Sect.  3.2.2),  which 
allows authors to intuitively design enhanced ebooks and self-publish them 
through the Apple iBookstore in a format with the extension “.ibooks”. The 
latest release of iBooks is version 3.0 (announced in October 2012), which 
introduces new templates, portrait-only books, and some other features.

Users using the iBooks reading application receive their content primarily 
from Apple’s iBookstore. The iBookstore delivers ebooks in the EPUB format 
(including Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB) and .ibooks. As the iBookstore uses 
Apple’s FairPlay DRM system (see Sect. 6.2), an export of ebooks out of the 
iBooks  application  to  other  readers  is  not  possible.  However,  users  of  the 
iBooks reading application can import EPUB and PDF ebooks from various 
other sources as long as they are not DRM protected. The iBookstore deliv-
ers EPUB content only to devices running at least Apple’s iOS 4; a download 
or reading of ebooks in non-Apple environments is not possible. The books 
available  in  the  iBookstore  come  from  many  major  publishers  (Penguin, 
HarperCollins,  Simon  &  Schuster,  Macmillan,  Hachette,  Springer,  and 
others)  as  well  as  other  sources  like  Project  Gutenberg11,  which  provides 
access to thousands of free books, or Smashwords12, which allows independ-
ent authors to self-publish.

3.2.1  Apple Fixed Layout EPUB

Three of the big ebook retailers (Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Apple) have 
developed their own and proprietary fixed-layout ebook formats. The Barnes 
& Nobles format is essentially an EPUB 2.0.1 format with some extensions. 
The page images used on the Nook reader of Barnes & Noble (software as 
well  as  physical  device)  are  directly  created  from  the  incoming  PDF  files. 
Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB (published in December 2010) is a descendant 
of EPUB 2.0.1 (published in September 2010) extended with some additional 
proprietary features. For example, the allowed page size is predefined and 
the text does not reflow with changing screen sizes and resolutions.

Publishers  of  children’s  books  were  especially  interested  in  Apple’s  Fixed 
Layout EPUB as it offers features not available with the EPUB 2.0.1 standard. 
Apple designed its Fixed Layout format so that the presentation of ebooks is 
optimal for the Apple devices iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Apple is able to 
ensure a proper presentation of graphic elements and illustrations in ebooks 
as they have full control over their reading devices running iBooks and do not 
need to support any non-iOS devices. There are only a few limitations of the 
format for publishers, for example, a maximal resolution for cover images, a 
maximal file size, a fixed size for videos, and constraints on the CSS parameters.

Besides  the  fixed-layout  option,  the  Apple  Fixed  Layout  EPUB  format 
also  has  some  other  interesting  features  like  text-to-speech  and  scripting. 
The  text-to-speech  functionality  (Apple  denoted  this  functionality  “Read 
Aloud”) is very similar to EPUB 3 (released ten months after Apple’s Fixed 
Layout EPUB) and realized by using Media Overlays (Sect. 3.1). Furthermore, 
in analogy to the upcoming EPUB 3 standard, Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB 
allows the use of JavaScript. However, Adobe Flash animations are not pos-
sible  as  Apple  does  not  support  this  software.  In  summary,  Apple’s  Fixed 
Layout EPUB offered publishers additional features ten months before the 
release of EPUB 3. With the release of EPUB 3, Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB 
became obsolete as all of its features are covered by EPUB 3. Currently, it is 
not actively developed by Apple any more, Apple instead supports and uses 
EPUB as the main format for ebooks. Nevertheless, there are still publishers 
who mainly publish ebooks through the iBookstore and prefer Apple’s Fixed 
Layout EPUB over EPUB 3.

3.2.2  iBooks Author

In January 2012, Apple presented the ebook authoring application iBooks 
Author13, a tool aimed at authors and publishers interested in self-publishing. 
In October 2012, Apple launched a new version 2.0 with additional features 
like  font  embedding,  rendering  of  mathematical  equations,  and  higher 
interactivity. The application can only be used on computers with iOS 5 or 
later and is free of charge. The output of iBooks Author is a book in either 
PDF format or a proprietary Apple file format (extension .ibooks) which can 
only be published through Apple’s iBookstore. The .ibooks format is based 
on EPUB 3, but uses proprietary XML namespaces and CSS extensions [6, 
5]. A publication of ebooks produced by iBooks Author in online stores or 
platforms  different  from  Apple’s  iBookstore  is  not  possible.  eBooks  in  the 
.ibooks format can only be viewed on iOS devices using the iBooks reading 
application. A direct import of EPUB ebooks into iBooks Author is neither 
possible nor necessary [18, 8], as authors that are interested in publishing 
EPUB books can directly upload their EPUB ebooks in the Apple iBookstore.

Technically, iBooks Author is an easy-to-use WYSIWYG editor for ebooks. 
Authors can directly edit text, colours, images, and charts. To create inter-
active  elements,  Apple  introduced  customizable  widgets  allowing  authors 
to create features like image galleries, movies or audio files, multiple-choice 
questions, slideshows, 3D elements, separate scrolling sidebars, pop-overs, 
and general HTML5 widgets14.

In summary, Apple supports the open EPUB standard and with the iBooks 
reading  application  provides  one  of  the  best  EPUB  3-compatible  readers. 
Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB was a temporarily used proprietary format which 
allowed authors to prepare fixed-layout ebooks before this feature was avail-
able in EPUB 3 more than 15 months later. In general, eBooks in the EPUB

format  can  be  easily  imported  into  Apple’s  ecosystem  and  displayed  on 
Apple devices. However, Apple established a closed ecosystem, as all ebooks 
once  developed  or  distributed  inside  the  Apple  world  can  never  leave  the 
ecosystem (except as PDF) and cannot be displayed or read on non-Apple 
devices.  The  main  instrument  of  Apple  for  creating  a  closed  ecosystem  is 
its DRM system FairPlay (see Sect. 6.2), which controls the usage of content 
on Apple devices and which does not allow an export of content out of the 
Apple world. Although Apple encourages authors to use the EPUB standard 
and  uses  the  standard  within  its  own  ecosystem,  the  system  is  closed  as 
ebooks can only be imported in the ecosystem, but are not allowed to leave 
the Apple world.

In  addition,  Apple  established  an  incompatible  format  for  the  generation 
of  content  that  should  be  distributed  in  its  ecosystem. The  authoring  tool 
iBooks Author produces ebooks in the .ibooks format, which is incompat-
ible with EPUB and can only be used and read inside the Apple ecosystem. 
The incompatibility between .ibooks (which can only be published through 
the iBookstore) and EPUB 3 is artificial and intended as it ensures that the 
authoring  tool  iBooks  Author  can  only  be  used  for  ebooks  that  are  sold 
through  Apple’s  iBookstore.  By  using  a  non-standard  variant  of  EPUB  3, 
Apple prevents authors using iBooks Author to create ebooks that are pub-
lished on other platforms rather than the iBookstore.

3.3  Amazon’s KF8 Format

In January 2012, Amazon released its new proprietary ebook format KF8. 
This XML format replaced the proprietary MOBI format, which was devel-
oped by the French company Mobipocket SA. Mobipocket SA was acquired 
by  Amazon  in  2005.  The  MOBI  format  (file  extension  .mobi  or  .prc)  is 
based  on  the  OEBPS  format  (Sect.  2)  extended  by  JavaScript  and  Frames. 
For copyright-protected ebooks, Amazon uses the AZW format, which is a 
variant of the MOBI format with additional compression. The AZW format 
allows Amazon to apply a DRM scheme (see Sect. 6.2) and to restrict the use 
of an ebook to a particular device (identified by its device ID associated to 
an Amazon user account). DRM-free AZW files are just compressed MOBI 
files. The MOBI (as well as AZW) format allow authors to produce text-heavy 
books; the support of multimedia or interactivity features is not possible.

eBooks  sold  through  Amazon’s  Kindle  Store  can  be  read  either  using  the 
proprietary Kindle reading devices, the proprietary Kindle reading software 
which is available for various operating systems (including iOS), or directly 
in a web browser. The first Kindle reader was introduced in 2007; a newer 
DX line with a larger screen was introduced in 2009. Newer reading devices 
have  additional  features  like  keyboard  (Kindle  Keyboard),  touch  display 
(Kindle Paperwhite), or colour display (Kindle Fire). All Kindles (except the 
Kindle Fire, which was introduced in September 2011) use digital ink, which 
limits the available colours to black and white.

Prof. Christoph Bläsi | Prof. Franz Rothlauf – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz 

21

Amazon’s  reading  devices  and  software  can  only  display  ebooks  available 
in PDF, AZW (MOBI), or KF8. Other formats like EPUB or Apple’s Fixed 
Layout EPUB cannot be displayed. In addition, Kindle’s terms of use explic-
itly forbid transferring ebooks sold through Amazon to other non-Amazon 
devices.  Due  to  the  large  economic  success  of  Amazon,  ebooks  in  AZW 
format are also available in other commercial and non-commercial ebook 
stores like Fictionwise (an electronic bookseller owned by Barnes & Noble), 
Project Gutenberg15, the World Public Library, and others.

Amazon started a self-publishing service named Kindle Direct Publishing 
in 2007. In the standard program, Amazon keeps about 65% of the revenues 
from ebook sales; the remaining revenue is for the author (and publisher). A 
newer program (named Kindle Direct Publishing Select Program) increases 
the royalties for the authors to 70% (which is similar to ebooks sold through 
Apple’s  iBookstore),  however  an  author  must  remove  his/her  ebook  from 
sales on all other websites, including their own website, for the first 90 days 
after publication. During this time period, Amazon has the exclusive right 
to distribute and sell the ebook.

Technically,  the  KF8  format  supports  HTML5  and  CSS3.  For  downward 
compatibility, a KF8 file contains two formats: a MOBI file of the ebook and 
a data structure similar to EPUB. Detailed specifications of the KF8 format 
are not publicly available. KF8 files can be created using either KindleGen16 
or  a  Plugin  for  Adobe  InDesign17.  The  proprietary  command  line  tool 
KindleGen  is  a  converter  which  expects  documents  in  HTML,  XTML, 
or  EPUB  format  as  input  and  converts  them  into  KF818.  Analogously,  the 
Plugin for Adobe InDesign allows a direct conversion of InDesign files to 
KF8. There are no other publicly available tools that allow authors to gener-
ate KF8 files.

In  comparison  to  the  previous  MOBI  format,  the  new  KF8  format  allows 
authors  to  include  audio  and  video  elements  in  an  ebook  by  supporting 
the HTML5 elements <audio> and <video>. However, not all of Amazon’s 
readers and reading applications support video. For example, movies can be 
played by the Kindle reading software for iOS but not by the Kindle reading 
software for Android or the different Kindle devices, including the Kindle 
Fire. All Kindle readers (except Kindle Fire) can only play audio files (if they 
have an earphone plug). Any kind of text-to-speech or read aloud function-
ality is not supported by KF8.

In general, KF8 supports many features of EPUB 2.0.1 and EPUB 3. With 
new guidelines published in February 2013 [3], Amazon aims for stronger 
EPUB  3  support:  now,  the  structure  of  cover  references  and  table  of  con-
tents  navigation  (toc-nav-elements)  follow  the  EPUB  3  specification  and

are offered as an alternative to the KF8 syntax. However, KF8 still carries 
forward some HTML constructions that were de-standardized years ago, but 
it also extends the EPUB 3 format with some functions to support Amazon’s 
proprietary fixed-layout option. To help authors to publish books through 
its  Kindle  Store,  Amazon  publishes  a  list  of  all  HTML  and  CSS  elements 
that are compatible with its KF8 format [1]. Like EPUB 3, KF8 supports CSS 
Media Queries, scalable vector graphics, and a fixed-layout option. As KF8 
supports  no  JavaScript,  HTML5  elements  like  <canvas>  cannot  be  used. 
Also, MathML is not supported.

In  summary,  Amazon  does  not  support  the  EPUB  standard,  but  uses  its 
own  proprietary  KF8  standard.  KF8  files  are  generated  by  a  proprietary 
converter which accepts EPUB files as input. However, Amazon introduced 
proprietary extensions and modifications making the two standards EPUB 
and KF8 incompatible. Like Apple, the Amazon world accepts EPUB files 
as input but does not allow users to export or transfer ebooks to other eco-
systems.  The  Kindle  readers,  as  well  as  the  Kindle  reading  software,  only 
display  ebooks  bought  in  the  Amazon  ebook  store,  and  Amazon’s  Kindle 
Store delivers content only to Amazon reading devices and software. This 
makes Amazon’s ecosystem closed as it allows no free exchange of books. 
Analogously to the Apple world, the main instruments for a closed ecosys-
tem are the impossibility of exporting ebooks, the tight coupling between 
reading devices and store, and the DRM protection. Unlike Apple, Amazon 
also uses an incompatible ebook format, which strengthens the closeness of 
its ecosystem.

4  Feature Comparison
In the previous sections, the focus was on the description of the develop-
ment of ebook formats up to EPUB 2.0.1, which for the first time integrated 
the standardization of ebook files for production with a standardization of 
ebooks  for  distribution  to  the  end-user.  In  the  latter  case,  issues  such  as 
compression  had  to  be  addressed.  Moreover,  the  approaches  to  overcome 
identified shortcomings of EPUB 2/2.0.1 (2007/2010) have been introduced. 
These  are  primarily  in  the  areas  of  interactivity  and  multimedia  (in  the 
direction of so-called enhanced ebooks), but also including, for example, the 
option to ‘switch off’ the reflow of text depending on the screen size or the 
resolution. The central strand of these efforts to overcome the restrictions of 
EPUB 2 is the further development of the standard in the form of EPUB 3 
(2011/2012);  however,  as  we  have  seen,  there  are  also  three  proprietary 
attempts, namely KF8 (by Amazon), Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks (both 
by Apple). In the following section we will single out potentially important 
features publishers might like to see in their ebooks. We will then inspect 
the ebook formats in relation to their ability to realize these ebook features 
with the help of features of their respective formats. The selection as well as 
the structuring of the ebook features covered in the following is influenced 
by an application-oriented perspective, rather than one on the basis of the 
development  history  or  the  technological  concept  of  the  formats.  Format 
features are clearly in focus; if it seems necessary or sensible, however, we 
will take reading device and reader software issues into account.

4.1  Core Features

Metadata

Metadata are data about data, in this case data about ebooks. Some of them 
are conveyed content-internally, i.e. as part of the ebook file (e.g. the author 
or the publisher of a book), or content-externally (e.g. the price or the order 
number).  They  are  often  used  for  administrative  purposes  (e.g.  to  enable 
the  identification  of  knowledge  resources  by  users  or  to  specify  copyright 
restrictions). In the case of EPUB 3 and EPUB 2, the Dublin Core Metadata 
Element  Set  (DCMES,  in  short:  Dublin  Core19)  is  supported  for  different 
kinds of metadata (the publication as a whole, but also, e.g., the videos in it). 
Dublin Core is a metadata standard that is also used in other contexts, espe-
cially library management; it specifies the information dimensions covered 
related to a content object. Certain metadata information of the 15 dimen-
sions from Dublin Core, such as title, language, identifier (e.g. the ISBN) are 
defined as compulsory in EPUB, while others (e.g. author(s), publisher) are 
optional.  In  addition  to  this,  EPUB  3  allows  the  definition  of  customized 
metadata information dimensions. Apart from Dublin Core, the metadata 
standards MARC (Library of Congress) and ONIX for Books (book trade), 

19  http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/

24 

Commissioned by the European & International Booksellers Federation

among others, are supported; however, Dublin Core is the first choice as it 
offers the most comprehensive set of information dimensions.

With  KF8,  the  situation  is  –  due  to  the  common  line  of  descent  of  the 
formats  (and  the  OPF  file  in  particular)  –  similar.  The  difference  is,  that 
KF8 does not support the definition of additional customized information 
dimensions  and  has  only  a  subset  of  12  out  of  the  15  basic  Dublin  Core 
information dimensions; of those, only the title and the language informa-
tion  are  compulsory.  On  the  other  hand,  older  versions  of  KF8  store  the 
reference  to  the  cover  as  an  obligatory  metadata  item,  which  is  different 
from the solution in other formats (see below).

The EPUB 2-descendent Fixed Layout EPUB by Apple shares the metadata 
arrangements with EPUB 2 – and therefore does not offer additional cus-
tomized metadata information dimensions, either.

With ebooks produced using iBooks Author, metadata are attributed with 
the help of an input form on the authoring tool interface. Apart from this 
aspect,  .ibooks  files  are,  as  we  have  seen,  similar  to  EPUB  2  files  and,  for 
example, they also contain an OPF file.

Text Appearance and Fonts

Generally, the presentation of text (regarding, for example, font and font 
size)  is  controlled  by  the  default  settings  of  the  reader  software  or  the 
device,  but  also,  alternatively,  by  the  parameters  defined  by  the  actual 
user in a certain situation. EPUB 3 and KF8, however, allow the definition 
of  default  font,  font  size,  character,  word  and  line  distances,  etc.,  using 
CSS. These settings can be overwritten by explicit customer intervention 
if desired and provided for by the reader application. The font file (in one 
of the two font formats OTF and WOFF, a W3C font format recommenda-
tion) can be made a part of the ebook file and be referenced from the OPF 
file. The handling of type-related values set for particular titles, however, 
is  not  managed  in  a  satisfactory  manner  by  many  reader  applications/
devices, up to the present day.

To prevent users from getting easy access to fonts supplied with ebook titles, 
EPUB  3  allows  publishers  to  obfuscate  fonts  by  encrypting  parts  of  the 
font file. The algorithm encrypts the first 1040 bytes of the font file using a 
key that depends on the actual content. This mechanism allows the use of 
fonts only for specific content and prevents a further distribution of fonts. 
The mechanisms make the distribution of fonts more difficult, but they are 
comparatively easy to circumvent. This somewhat compromised protection 
is the reason, why many commercially traded fonts are not approved for the 
use in EPUB ebooks by the font copyright holders. With KF8, the encryp-
tion  of  the  embedded  fonts  (in  this  case  in  OTF  or  TTF  as  font  formats) 
is guaranteed by the binary encoding of the ebook file as a whole. For the 
support of international character sets, please consult Sect. 4.3.

Layout of Text

Reflowable Layout

Issues  regarding  font,  font  size,  etc.,  have  been  dealt  with  in  the  previous 
subsection;  this  subsection  covers  issues  concerning  the  distribution  of 
text on a page. The type area (the area of the page without the top, bottom, 
right  and  left  margins)  can  be  defined  globally  in  EPUB  3  using  the  CSS 
command “margin”. With KF8, it cannot be controlled globally and the top 
and bottom margins cannot be customized at all; the default print area on 
Amazon  devices/reader  applications,  however,  provides  for  rather  big  top 
and bottom margins by default.

With a reflowable text – a text that adapts to a particular screen concerning 
line length and line breaks – enforced page breaks generally do not make 
sense. With the help of the CSS command “page-break”, it can be achieved, 
e.g., to mark the beginning of a chapter. Moreover, reader applications gen-
erally insert a page break between the different HTML files that make up 
an  ebook.  Compared  to  KF8,  EPUB  3  offers  additional  options  to  control 
the aesthetics of the displaying of text, e.g. by commands like “page-break-
before” or “avoid” (keep paragraphs or headings together with subheadings). 
Moreover, there are commands that prevent “orphans” and “widows”; since 
the corresponding violation of typographic rules is considered unaesthetic, 
these commands enforce minimum numbers of lines as last and first para-
graphs on pages, respectively. EPUB 3 also offers an automatic hyphenation 
which  can  be  avoided  by  using  the  command  “non-breaking-space”.  The 
defects  of  KF8  mentioned  are  the  reason  why  the  composition  in  Kindle 
environments  is  often  criticized  by  typographers.  Other  reasons  for  this 
are, that KF8 (as opposed to EPUB 3) does not enable language-dependent 
automatic syllable divisions and has justified composition as a default. KF8, 
however,  allows  at  least  “soft-hyphens”,  the  upfront  tagging  of  potential 
breaks by the publisher.

Fixed Layout

The  challenge  of  fixed-layout  arrangements  with  digital  books  is  that  the 
look of the page (with text in a predefined typeface, in a predefined type size, 
etc.) on the one hand has to be stored, transferred and displayed much like 
an image. On the other hand, however, the text of the page should still be 
searchable (which, of course, is not the case for text as images). To achieve 
this, texts of the page has to be defined not only regarding the ASCII values 
of letters and numbers, but also regarding fixed pixel information. This is a 
challenge that in principle is, for example, analogically addressed by PDF as 
a data format.

The result for readers is similar with all fixed-layout formats – if he or she 
wants  to  enlarge  certain  sections  on  a  page,  this  can  only  be  achieved  by 
zooming in and not by, for example, selecting a larger font and have the page 
line-wrapped accordingly. In the case of KF8, the zooming in is provided 

26

with the help of pop-ups; the sections to be displayed in the pop-ups have to 
be identified by the publisher in advance. If provided for by reader applica-
tions on special devices, a fixed-layout double page spread is displayed rather 
than a single page. This can be triggered by certain conditions (Fixed Layout 
EPUB on iPads, controlled by an inclination sensor) or set globally (KF8, 
controlled by the publisher in advance, using the “landscape” command).

In fixed-layout contexts, it has to be defined explicitly, in which place on a 
page a letter, a word or an image are meant to be displayed. This description 
of the visual appearance of the page and its components can be realized with 
fixed pixel measurements in EPUB 3, whereas in KF8 percent measurements 
and  the  “em”  measure,  a  traditional  measure  used  by  typographers  (an 
alternative to points/pt), are used. An informal example for the former solu-
tion would be that an “A” in 10 pt Times New Roman is positioned at pixel 
location X=200/y=400: for the latter solution, that this letter is positioned at 
30% of the horizontal and 40% of the vertical extension of the actual screen.
It is obvious that the latter solution can cope with yet unknown screen sizes 
and resolutions in the future.

As has been mentioned above, the text of a page is also stored as symbolic 
text, on top of the visually oriented page description. This is necessary for 
searches and text-to-speech functionalities.

Differences  between  the  various  fixed-layout  solutions  are,  for  example, 
given by the fact that the fixed-layout option has to/can only be set globally 
in KF8, i.e. for the whole document. This is done as part of the global choice 
between the main genres the format is designed for, namely children’s books 
on the one hand and comics on the other. This is specified in the metadata. 
As opposed to this restriction, the fixed-layout option can be specified for 
single  pages  in  EPUB  3,  in  the  HTML  header.  Another  difference  is  that, 
in KF8, the visually oriented page description is specified for double-page 
spreads, whereas this is done for single pages in the other formats.

With  Apple’s  Fixed  Layout  EPUB,  the  fixed-layout  option  is  triggered 
through a corresponding file that is added to the META-INF folder. With 
KF8 and EPUB 3, it is done in the OPF folder, where all metadata are speci-
fied. Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB can be seen as the functional predecessor 
of EPUB 3 with respect to this feature.

Fixed-layout issues are dealt with in detail in a recent BISG document20.

Tables

Displaying tables in ebooks requires a trading off between appearance and 
readability of the table for readers on the one hand, and searchability and 
adaptability to displaying parameters like screen size and resolution on the 
other. A way that exclusively stresses the first in reflowable contexts is includ-
ing tables as images. Including tables using HTML and CSS to be rendered 

20  http://www.bisg.org/docs/FieldGuideFXLBooks_version1.0.pdf

Prof. Christoph Bläsi | Prof. Franz Rothlauf – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz 

27

according to displaying parameters is a solution that provides searchability 
– it also allows the application of the text-to-speech function on them. In 
spite of being provided for in all formats in principle, this does not yield sat-
isfying results in more complex cases (extensive use of colours, lines, wide 
columns, etc.). The reason for this is the current  state of the development 
of the reader applications, which are not yet able to cope with some of the 
standard table constructs of HTML and CSS; evidence for such unsatisfying 
cases  in  different  ecosystems  is  documented  [10,  Sect.  4.6].  As  a  fall-back 
solution,  an  HTML  file  can  additionally  be  linked  to  an  image. There  are 
solutions for better results: these, however, require additional effort, either 
by using Media Queries and specifying explicitly different tables for differ-
ent displaying parameters or, indeed, by using JavaScript. Both options, of 
course, depend on the support of Media Queries or JavaScript by the respec-
tive formats.

In fixed-layout contexts, problems regarding different displaying parameters 
do not apply, since the appearance of the table is explicitly defined.

Fundamental differences between the formats regarding the integration of 
tables  as  images  or  as  HTML  tables  cannot  be  stated. There  are,  however, 
additional  options  in  formats  that  allow  Media  Queries  or  JavaScript. 
JavaScript  is  supported  by  EPUB  3,  .ibooks  and  to  a  lesser  extent  Apple’s 
Fixed Layout EPUB.

Cover

EPUB 2 did not provide an explicit solution to include a cover in the sense 
of a cover image. It was possible, however, to reference a corresponding file 
from the metadata. This solution can still be used to cater for downward-
compatibility  in  EPUB  3  and  KF8  and  is  still  the  standard  way  it  is  done 
with Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks. The more elaborate EPUB 3 
solution  is  to  reference  the  cover  image  from  the  spine  and  include  it  in 
the manifest of the OPF file – as JPEG, PNG, GIF or SVG and without size 
restrictions.  The  reference  in  the  spine  specifies  the  position  of  the  cover 
image relative to, for example, the table of contents or the cover page while 
reading  the  ebook.  Interestingly,  this  solution  is  also  provided  for  in  the 
current version of KF8.

Navigation and Table of Contents

Independently from how reader applications present this feature to readers 
(i.e. by showing buttons for every chapter), the traditional format for tables 
of contents in EPUB 2 was an obligatory .ncx file. It is still the standard way 
it is done with Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks. This solution was 
replaced  by  a  non-proprietary  HTML5  solution  using  the  <nav>  element 
in  EPUB  3.  The  units  marked  up  with  the  help  of  the  <nav>  element  do 
not have to be text, they can also be images. By using “page-list” together 
with the <nav> element referring to a traditional fixed page number is also 

28 

Commissioned by the European & International Booksellers Federation

possible,  as  long  as  these  page  numbers  are  also  specified  in  the  text  files 
themselves.  Interestingly,  this  solution  is  also  provided  for  in  the  current 
version of KF8. Before this last amendment, KF8 also used the .ncx file; in 
addition, the inclusion of an HTML table of contents page that is presented 
to the reader as the first page of the text is recommended – on top of the UI 
solution of the reader application on the basis of the .ncx file (as mentioned, 
e.g. with the help of buttons). Amazon’s idea behind this is to satisfy possible 
expectations by readers.

Images

Regarding the integration of images, the general solution has not changed 
from EPUB 2 to the formats in focus in this report: images are integrated 
using  the  HTML  element  <img>.  When  using  the  fixed-layout  option 
(for  children’s  books  and  comics)  in  KF8,  however,  the  CSS  command 
“background-image”  must  be  used  instead  of  the  <img>  element.  This  is 
to prevent a collision with the KF8-specific region magnification function.

KF8  supports  GIF,  BMP,  JPEG,  non-transparent  PNG  and  SVG  as  image 
formats. There are recommendations (resolution: rather low) and restrictions 
(file size, different for ebooks using the fixed-layout option and ones that do 
not). The adherence to these restrictions is taken care of automatically by the 
KindleGen production software; it is said to be not in the interest of users 
(download times).

.ibooks supports JPEG, PNG, and GIF, JPEG and PNG are explicitly recom-
mended by Apple. There are also recommendations regarding file sizes and 
resolutions.

EPUB, including EPUB 3, supports GIF, JPEG, PNG and SVG as file formats 
and does not have file size restrictions as a format. However, there can of 
course be specific restrictions from the side of ebook shop providers also for 
EPUB.

4.2  Multimedia and Interactivity

Audio and Video

EPUB 3

The  EPUB  3  specifications  Content  Documents  3.021  and  Media  Overlays 
3.022 specify in which way audio and video files are integrated, played back 
and  synchronized  in  an  ebook.  This  is  primarily  done  using  the  HTML5 
elements  <audio>  and  <video>.  The  audio  and  video  formats  any  reader/
device will be expected to be able to play back are listed as core media types 
in the Publications 3.0 specification23, while others are optional.

Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB

The integration of audio and video is the central improvement, which Apple 
introduced with its Fixed Layout EPUB format in 2010 (EPUB only first fea-
tured this in its EPUB 3 version from 2011, see above) [4]. At this time, such 
an  integration  was  not  possible  with  any  other  ebook  format.  To  achieve 
this, Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB supported the HTML5 elements <audio> 
and <video> from the beginning. To guarantee an optimal playback of the 
multimedia content on mobile Apple devices, Apple specifies maximal file 
sizes, a selection of supported data formats as well as (for video) the size of 
the corresponding frame; according to that, audio can be integrated as m4a 
files (AAC, MP4), and video as m4v files (H.264 in an MPEG4 container) [4].

Apple .ibooks

The  format  produced  by  Apple’s  iBooks  Author  ebook  authoring  tool  can 
– in spite of the format specification not being published – be said to be a 
variant of EPUB (2). The format details of the integration of audio and video 
files (which is possible) are not known – from the features presented on the 
authoring tool interface, it can be deduced, however, what .ibooks files must 
be able to express and what the iBooks reader software on Apple devices can 
play back: iBooks Author from version 2.0 on supports the integration of all 
multimedia data formats that are supported by Apple’s QuickTime media 
player24.  The  iBooks  Author  authoring  tool  optimizes  audio  and  video 
regarding resolution etc., for the rendering on iPads.

Amazon KF8

Also with KF8, the integration of video and audio files in ebooks is generally 
possible – like in the other cases, the HTML5 elements <audio> and <video> 
are used for that. The playing back of audio and video content, however, is 
only enabled for the case of ebooks being read with the help of Amazon’s 
Kindle  iOS  app  for  the  mobile  devices  of  Apple  [2]  –  but  not  on  Amazon 
devices.  This  is  surprising,  since  at  least  some  of  Amazon’s  own  reading 
devices are, in principle, able to play multimedia content (some only audio, 
the Kindle Fire also video).

Text-to-Speech (TTS) and the Synchronization  
of Text and Time-Based Media

Here,  the  text-to-speech  related  features  as  well  as  the  ones  related  to  the 
synchronization of (written) text with time-based media, especially audio 
(for the read aloud function) of the various ebook formats are discussed.

24  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3775

Commissioned by the European & International Booksellers Federation

EPUB 3

With EPUB 3, these features are specified in the EPUB Content Documents 
3.025 as well as the EPUB Media Overlays 3.026.

“EPUB 3 provides the following text-to-speech (TTS) facilities for control-
ling aspects of speech synthesis, such as pronunciation, prosody and voice 
characteristics:  Pronunciation  Lexicons  using  the  W3C  Pronunciation 
Lexicon  Specification  1.0  (PLS)27;  the  incorporation  of  SSML  phonemes 
functionality  directly  into  a  EPUB  Content  Document,  using  the  Speech 
Synthesis  Markup  Language  (SSML)  Version  1.0  28;  CSS  Speech  Features 
from the CSS3 specification CSS Speech Module29.”30 This means, that, using 
EPUB  3,  features  of  the  text-to-speech  output  by  a  corresponding  engine 
of a reader software can be parametrized (with respect to volume, male or 
female voice, modulation, etc.) by a set of standardized declarative files, one 
of them being CSS Speech, a part of CSS3. This feature enables, for example, 
“synthetic” audio books on the basis of written text in a very flexible manner.

The Media Overlays function enables the synchronization of audio (typically 
pre-recorded audio narration) with textual content, typically by highlight-
ing  (e.g.  with  the  help  of  colour)  the  word  just  pronounced  at  any  given 
moment. “In EPUB 3, Media Overlay Documents are created to describe the 
timing for the pre-recorded audio narration and how it relates to the EPUB 
Content Document markup. The file format for Media Overlays is defined 
as a subset of SMIL, a W3C recommendation for representing synchronized 
multimedia  information  in  XML.”31  The  narration  “can  be  represented  as 
a  series  of  audio  clips,  each  corresponding  to  part  of  the  EPUB  Content 
Document.  A  single  audio  clip,  for  example,  typically  represents  a  single 
phrase  or  paragraph,  but  infers  no  order  relative  to  the  other  clips  or  to 
the text of a document. Media Overlays solve this problem of synchroniza-
tion  by  tying  the  structured  audio  narration  to  its  corresponding  text  (or 
other media) in the EPUB Content Document using SMIL markup. Media 
Overlays are, in fact, a simplified subset of SMIL 3.0 that allow the playback 
sequence  of  these  clips  to  be  defined.”32  For  making  the  synchronization 
work, both the textual content and the (single) audio file, therefore, have to 
be tagged accordingly, using the mark-up provided by SMIL (a specialized 
XML language). Synchronizing textual information with other time-based 
media, e.g. with video subtitling, would generally follow the same principle, 
but is not yet supported by EPUB 3.

Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB

Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB also offers the function to synchronize written 
text with audio, highlighting words in the text correspondingly. This func-
tion is called Read Aloud with Apple and is restricted to Fixed Layout EPUBs; 
reflowable EPUBs cannot make use of this feature, even if they are conform-
able with the iBookstore. “In read aloud books, an audio file using a narra-
tor’s voice can read the text on a page and the words can be highlighted as 
they are spoken. The reader can choose to have the pages turn automatically 
to keep the session flowing, or set them to turn manually. iBooks (Reader 
app) syncs text and audio using Media Overlays, an EPUB-specific subset of 
Synchronized  Multimedia  Integration  Language  (SMIL).”  [4]  This  means, 
that Apple – as with the IDPF standard/EPUB 3 – uses SMIL to configure 
the  synchronisation  of  pre-recorded  audio  with  text.  Fixed  Layout  EPUB 
also allows the integration of play, pause and stop controls into the reader 
(on Apple devices). When using those, the listener can control the playing 
back of the audio. A text-to-speech option, triggering and configuring the 
reading by a “synthetic” voice is not provided in Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB.

Apple .ibooks

With  iBooks  Author,  text-to-speech  or  read  aloud  functions  cannot  be 
integrated; hence the question of how these functions are represented in the 
.ibooks data format is not applicable.

Amazon KF8

With KF8, neither a text-to-speech option nor the synchronization of audio 
with the corresponding highlighting of text is integrated; Media Overlays 
have not been adopted for KF8.

Interactivity and Animation

EPUB 3

With EPUB 3, there are two possibilities to realize native animations (as opposed 
to pre-recorded ones that are played back as videos) and interactive features. 
One has to keep in mind in any case, that animated content only makes sense 
on backlit devices like smartphones and tablets, since digital ink readers are not 
able to play this back due to hardware restrictions. The first possibility is using 
the CSS construct of transformations; using this, objects can be translated, etc. 
This is part of the core EPUB 3 specification and therefore any reader software/
device conforming to EPUB 3 must be able to display corresponding content. 
Simple animations and other dynamic content items can be realized this way: 
objects get positioned 2- or 3-dimensionally and are made to move33. The other 
functionally less restricted possibility is using JavaScript code; this, however, is 
only an optional element of EPUB 3 and therefore certain reader applications/
devices might not be able to display it. The IDPF therefore recommends to use 

33  http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/

32 

Commissioned by the European & International Booksellers Federation

alternative  options  rather  than  JavaScript  whenever  possible.  More  advanced 
modes of animations interactivity can only be realized using JavaScript, however. 
So, JavaScript together with the HTML5 element <aside> enables better options, 
e.g.  for  marginalia  or  footnotes,  such  as  pop-ups.  Further  JavaScript  options 
include forms which can be used to establish a feedback channel from the reader 
to the publisher, or functions that make use of the geographical location of the 
reader, which is made available in the case of devices with a GPS sensor via an 
HTML5 element. Coming back to animations – in the sense of dynamic graph-
ics – JavaScript code can be used for specifying objects and their movements on 
an HTML5 construct called canvas. This allows the replacement of proprietary 
technologies like Adobe Flash34, which is, for example, not available on Apple 
devices. Since JavaScript is always executed in a so-called “sandbox”, however, 
there cannot be a sustainable exchange between the JavaScript application and 
other applications on the device. This makes it impossible to make use of contact 
details  from  the  email  application  or  to  permanently  store  settings  beyond  a 
session in the EPUB container.

Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB

Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB – in spite of being based on EPUB 2.0.1., which 
does  not  support  dynamic  content  –  has  supported  JavaScript  code  from 
the  beginning  (2010).  Only  simple  animations,  e.g.  animations  with  little 
complex code are possible this way, however.

Apple .ibooks

The authoring tool iBooks Author promises users that the integration of dynamic 
content is particularly easy – using the slogan “Interactivity in every book” to 
communicate this35. Correspondingly, there are widgets for the production of 
pop-ups,  interactive  images  with  wheeling  and  zooming  options,  animated 
presentations, scrollable sidebars, multiple choice tests, etc. As mentioned above, 
the .ibooks format is not publicly documented and it is, therefore, not possible 
to formally describe the expressive power (and its limits) of .ibooks with respect 
to animations and interactivity in more detail. It is even possible with iBooks 
Author to integrate so-called HTML widgets (consisting of JavaScript and CSS 
code),  which  is  essentially  custom-made  interactive  content  that  can  thus  be 
integrated into .ibooks ebooks, supplementing functions that cannot be realized 
using the built-in options of the tool.

With  KF8,  neither  JavaScript  nor  CSS  transformations  are  supported. 
This  means  that  interactive  forms,  animations,  etc.  cannot  be  realized 
for  KF8  books.  There  are  however  a  number  of  proprietary  functions 
that, for instance, allow   the display of magnified image areas as pop-ups 
(Magnification, Panel View [for comics etc.]).

34  Flash is a software by Adobe. With its help, animations and animated graphics can be 

produced for integration into websites and other digital products.

4.3  Globalization and Accessibility

Global Language Support

EPUB 3

EPUB 3 has been designed by the IDPF to be used worldwide, hence also 
across languages and writing systems. This can be illustrated by the fact that 
non-Latin writing systems/character sets (and their possibly differing direc-
tions of reading: from top to bottom, from right to left,…) can be integrated, 
e.g. for Japanese, Chinese or Arabic. As a generalization of a core feature, 
fonts of the writing systems mentioned, including special characters, can be 
included. Most of the features just mentioned are also available for EPUB 3 
metadata, including file and directory names: this makes global distribution 
easier. The UTF-8 encoding for the Unicode character set is supported36. In 
HTML5,  referring  to  the  ebook  content,  reading  directions  can  be  speci-
fied for the rendering engines of reader applications/devices. HTML5 – and 
hence EPUB 3 – also supports ruby annotations, a system for annotations 
for the pronunciation of Asian languages (but presupposes that the reader 
software/device is able to display it). Beyond this, CSS3 modules allow for 
design options regarding the typography, e.g. by vertically displaying text in 
a writing system that is usually displayed horizontally. It also allows for the 
control of syllable divisions and the representation of stress marks on top 
of letters. Finally, as mentioned already while presenting the text-to-speech 
functionality, pronunciation rules for any language can be specified using 
PLS and SSML; this includes interpreting ruby annotations (see above).

Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB, Apple .ibooks

With  Apple’s  Fixed  Layout  EPUB  –  being  based  on  EPUB  2  (which  does 
not have global language support) – one has to assume that global language 
support as described above (for EPUB 3) is not supported. The same must be 
assumed for .ibooks.

KF8

With  KF8,  only  Latin,  Japanese  (without  ruby  annotations,  however), 
Chinese,  and  Korean  characters  are  supported  to  a  certain  extent.  As  an 
option (the support is not guaranteed for all Kindle devices [2]), left-to-right 
writing  systems  can  also  be  displayed  vertically,  if  this  is  specified  in  the 
metadata accordingly. This does not apply for writing systems with a right-
to-left reading direction, however.

Accessibility

The  most  striking  accessibility-oriented  feature  for  ebooks  is  the  text-to-
speech  functionality,  which  we  have  described  for  EPUB  3  and  Apple’s 
Fixed Layout EPUB (Read Aloud, more restricted) above. Another feature 
of  EPUB  3  are  so-called  fallbacks,  which  enable  the  specification  of  an 

36  http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html#sec-gls

alternative media element in place of one that might not be received by the 
ebook  user,  be  it  as  a  consequence  of  a  disability  or  in  a  certain  situation 
(e.g. with background noise). The typical case is an explanation text instead 
of a video. In EPUB 3, there are HTML5 options to realize this, e.g. using an 
attribute within the <video> element.

4.4  Future Features

There are a number of items on the agenda list of the IDPF, concerning the 
further development of EPUB or its features. In the following text, we will 
mention the most striking examples.

Advanced/Hybrid Layouts

“The Advanced/Hybrid Layouts working group intends to publish a set of 
modular  specifications  that  extends  EPUB  3  functionality  to  better  meet 
the full needs of the ecosystem with regards to user and context adaptation 
and reading of image-based publications such as comics and magazines.”37 
In future versions of EPUB, these specifications will, for example, allow to 
differentiate presentation specifications between different parts of publica-
tions, e.g., for the case of multilingual publications.

Dictionaries and Glossaries

In38  some  reader  applications,  dictionaries  for  use  from  other  ebooks  can 
be integrated. These can be consulted from all ebooks on the correspond-
ing  reader,  not  differentiating  between  them. The  IDPF,  however,  sees  the 
need for access to specific dictionaries, glossaries, etc. from certain books 
(e.g. children’s books, language learning books, scholarly books). Therefore, 
future versions of EPUB will be able to integrate dictionaries and glossaries 
specific to books; one among these can be selected as a preferred source of 
reference for a book by users.

Indexes

“Indexes are specialized navigational and supplemental information tools that 
offer readers an interaction with content that is enhanced, more powerful, and 
more specific than simple search. Users will expect to have indexes available in 
the EPUB 3 ecosystem and accessible as easily as search. Publishers of EPUB 3 
content wish to make this data available to users, to allow them to explore book 
contents  beyond  what  search  results  reveal.”39  Index  entries  are  links  to  por-
tions of text; these links do not have to – but of course can – be a literal extract 
from the portion of text, but they are the result of editorial work and might, for 
example, consist of an hyperonym of one of the key concepts. Future versions 
of EPUB will be able to integrate such indexes, including for reverse use in the 
sense that index entries associated with a range of text can also be viewed.

Advanced Adaptive Layout

“This EPUB specification defines a model for template-based adaptive paginated 
layouts as an extension to CSS. The features described in the specification allow 
authors to describe precise page appearances that adapt to a wide range of device 
sizes and custom user settings. Its primary focus are interactive display environ-
ments in which the page size and user-defined font metrics are unknown at the 
time of document authoring and layout has to be done on the fly. This specifica-
tion builds on CSS 2.1 and several CSS3 modules.”40 This feature of future EPUB 
versions addresses the conflict of interests, that on the one hand certain types 
of books have a typical (and mostly also relevant: cf., for example, a cookbook) 
layout, some settings for which should not be disposable for adaptation by users 
to guarantee the reading experience or a recognition effect, respectively. On the 
other hand, there are different devices available with different screen sizes and 
resolutions – and of course reader preferences: font, type size, etc. – that should 
allow for adaptation. This feature defines a process in which content can flow 
dynamically into a set of linked containers based on page templates.

4.5  Summary of the Feature Comparison

Metadata

EPUB 3 has the most developed metadata options. While all other formats 
are  restricted  to  a  limited  subset  of  the  Dublin  Core  information  dimen-
sions,  EPUB  3  also  supports  alternative  metadata  standards  and  allows 
customized metadata.

Text Appearance and Fonts and Layout of Text

With respect to options concerning the pre-specification of fonts, font sizes, etc., 
as well as the integration of special fonts for single ebooks, the formats in focus 
are very similar. Concerning the arrangement of text blocks on a page, EPUB 
3 offers the most comprehensive set of controllable parameters. KF8 has limi-
tations, e.g. concerning the specification of margins as well as of aesthetically 
motivated  interventions  like  the  aversion  of  so-called  orphans  and  widows. 
Moreover,  the  fixed-layout  option  can  only  be  set  globally,  i.e.  for  the  whole 
document. With KF8, positions in the fixed-layout option can be specified using 
a percentage-oriented measure (as opposed to a pixel-position oriented one as 
used in EPUB 3), which gives it a higher degree of flexibility for future screens.

Tables

In  all  formats  in  focus,  the  integration  of  HTML/CSS  tables  is  possible. 
However,  the  support  by  the  reader  applications  to  display  tables  nicely 
and  correctly  is  on  an  unsatisfactory  (and  badly  documented)  level.  An 
important additional option (JavaScript) to realize complex tables is given 
with EPUB 3 and .ibooks as well as – to a lesser extent – with Apple’s Fixed 
Layout EPUB.

Cover

Regarding  the  integration  of  covers,  EPUB  3  and  KF8  allow  a  more  flex-
ible  referencing  of  the  cover  file  (relative,  e.g.,  to  the  table  of  content  or 
the first page of the book) from the spine rather than from the metadata. 
Independently, the latter solution is offered by all formats in focus, not least 
to ensure downward compatibility with older reader applications.

Navigation and Table of Contents

Using  the  HTML5  element  <nav>,  EPUB  3  and  KF8  enable  more  flexible 
tables of contents, e.g. ones that have images rather than only text portions 
as active links to sections in the book or that are able to reference the fixed 
page numbers of the underlying printed book. Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB 
and  .ibooks  use  the  less  advanced  and  EPUB-proprietary  (rather  than 
HTML standard based) .ncx file for tables of contents.

Images

With  respect  to  the  integration  of  images,  the  formats  in  focus  are  very 
similar; this is not least due to the fact that the <img> option had already 
been part of EPUB 2. Current differences mainly refer to restrictions con-
cerning file sizes.

Multimedia

All  data  formats  reviewed  can  integrate  multimedia  content  (audio  and 
video), differentiated only by restrictions regarding which audio and video 
formats can be expected to be played back by the appertaining reader appli-
cations. KF8 is a special case in that audio and video can be integrated into 
the format as such; these, however, will not be played back on Kindle devices 
at all, but only on the iOS Kindle app on Apple devices.

Text-to-Speech

EPUB  3  allows  text-to-speech,  controllable  to  a  large  extent  using  stand-
ardized  file  formats,  as  well  as  the  synchronization  of,  for  example,  text 
highlighting and pre-recorded narration. The latter synchronization is also 
supported  by  Apple’s  Fixed  Layout  EPUB;  this  format,  however,  does  not 
support text-to-speech. KF8 and .ibooks do not offer any of these features.

Interactivity and Animation

EPUB  3  offers  two  fundamental  options  for  dynamic  content  (dialogues, 
animations), namely one using CSS transform and one using – essentially 
unrestricted  –  JavaScript;  JavaScript,  however,  is  only  an  option  in  that  it 
cannot  be  expected  to  be  supported  by  every  reader  application.  Apple’s 
.ibooks  format  (as  generated  by  iBooks  Author)  generally  offers  the  same 
options as EPUB 3 in this area; some of them are presented as options on 
iBook Author’s WYSIWYG interface, more complex ones can be integrated 
using HTML widgets (containing CSS and JavaScript code). Apple’s Fixed 
Layout  EPUB  only  supports  simple  JavaScript  code.  With  KF8,  generic

37

dynamic content is not supported; there is, however, a proprietary function 
that allows the magnification of image areas as pop-ups (e.g. for comics).

Global Language Support

EPUB 3 offers a wide range of options for internationalization from Unicode 
as character set (in UTF-8 encoding) via full flexibility regarding the reading 
direction  to  the  configurability  of  the  text-to-speech  function  regarding 
language-dependent  pronunciation  rules.  With  KF  8,  only  a  few  Asian 
languages  are  supported.  Apple’s  Fixed  Layout  EPUB  and  Apple’s  .ibooks 
do  not  offer  support  beyond  languages  with  Latin  characters.  Important 
features  providing  better  access  to  ebooks  for  disabled  people  include  the 
text-to-speech feature (EPUB 3 and – to a more restricted degree – Apple’s 
Fixed Layout EPUB) and so-called fallbacks, which allow the specification 
of alternative media elements (e.g. a text alternative to a video); the latter are 
only provided for in EPUB 3.

Bottom Line of the Feature Comparison

Comparing the expressive power of the formats in focus, we have seen that 
these are either more or less equivalent (e.g. regarding images) or EPUB 3 
realizes the more or less obvious superset of what is possible in the different 
formats (e.g. regarding the text-to-speech functionality or the full JavaScript 
support  for  interactivity).  At  the  moment,  there  is  one  single  feature  that 
gives KF8 a slightly higher potential for future developments: its measure-
ment for fixed positions on a screen in fixed-layout contexts is based on per-
centage information rather than on absolute pixel positions (as in EPUB 3).

5  Alternative Options
The general paradigm of the production and distribution of ebooks, includ-
ing  enhanced  ebooks,  we  have  looked  at  here  is  one  in  which  a  file  that 
encodes the content of the ebook, including its hypertext structure, inter-
active  features  and  multimedia,  is  downloaded  by  a  customer  and  stored 
and viewed on his (typically mobile) device. A subtype of this paradigm is 
given by a set-up in which this file is not downloaded, but kept on a central 
server as part of the so-called cloud (and rendered from there). This file is 
declarative,  i.e.  it  is  not  a  program  or  an  application,  but  it  just  describes 
the ebook with all its features; it is written in a special “language”, e.g. in 
EPUB 3 or KF8. This description is rendered into an actual ebook with the 
help of a reading application that runs on the mobile device and is able to 
handle this “language” or data format respectively, rendering what is on the 
lowest symbolic level of observation just a string of 0s and 1s into something 
that can be read as a book on a screen. Interoperability issues around this 
paradigm  of  production  and  distribution  of  ebooks  just  presented  are  the 
subject  of  this  report.  To  roughly  adumbrate  the  bigger  picture,  however, 
we  would  like  to  introduce  two  alternative  options  for  realizing  digital 
books; these are substantially different from the one just presented. The first 
of these alternatives are book apps and the second ebook streaming. Both 
get applied in actual products and projects, but as of now do not have the 
market significance of the declarative download-file-and-view paradigm.

5.1  Book Apps

App – for application – has become the common name for programs that 
are  developed  especially  for  smartphones  and  tablets.  The  distribution 
channels  for  these  apps  are  the  so  called  app  stores  of  the  various  mobile 
operating/‘ecosystems’:  iTunes  for  Apple’s  iOS  operating  system,  Google 
Play for Google’s Android operating system, etc. Mobile apps in this sense 
– procedural files that do not need reader software to be run, but include 
content as well as the reading/rendering application – can also be used to 
realize digital books, and multimedia interactive ones in particular. Typical 
cases for this are children’s books or ‘books’ with special features like export-
able annotations. These cannot be realized in the interplay between a book 
as a declarative file (e.g. EPUB 3) on the one hand, and the corresponding 
reader application (over which the originator of the digital book does not 
have any control) on the other. There are three fundamental ways to produce 
(book) apps – as native apps, as web apps, or as hybrid apps. Native apps are 
programs,  pieces  of  software,  that  only  run  on  the  operating  system  they 
are developed for, using native programming languages like Java (Android), 
Objective C (iOS), or .Net (Windows), respectively. To make a title available 
on various operating systems, it must be implemented separately for every 
single one.

Prof. Christoph Bläsi | Prof. Franz Rothlauf – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz 

39

A so-called web app is actually not an application – it is a declarative file, 
which uses the language elements of websites (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) and 
therefore can be viewed using a web browser, e.g. Safari/Apple or Chrome/
Google. This web browser is able to adapt the content to the respective display 
size and resolution. Web apps typically cannot be run in offline mode, as 
server-side interactive features cannot be made available. The third case is, 
when the declarative book content and the application being able to render 
it (not a web browser) are integrated in an app, a self-containing application; 
this is a logical requirement for getting distributed via an app store. Such 
a combination of website-like content with a proprietary native rendering 
app is called a hybrid app. As with native apps, this opens up the app stores 
as distribution channels to publishers. The advantage of hybrid apps with 
separated content modules compared to native apps, in which content and 
rendering are inextricably intertwined, is that they can be developed faster, 
easier and hence more economically using so-called app frameworks. Such a 
framework facilitates the methodical (parallel) development of hybrid apps 
for different operating systems. It offers interfaces which make it possible to 
address operating system specific functions in a uniform way. This makes 
it possible to develop the content only once per title (using HTML5, CSS, 
JavaScript), which then, using the app framework, can be made available for 
different operating systems without much effort. Remaining advantages of 
native apps compared to hybrid apps are mainly in the gaming sector, since 
complex  graphic  processing  cannot  be  realized  in  a  sufficiently  effective 
manner using JavaScript (as opposed to Java proper).

When compared to ebooks in the sense of declarative files (EPUB or one of 
the proprietary formats) displayed on a reader application, book apps – be 
they native or hybrid apps – allow functions like communicating with other 
applications  like  mail,  messaging  or  phone  applications.  The  same  is  true 
for the export or the storing of annotations or for the recording of audio. 
Book apps are pretty common in the area of children’s books. It has to be 
remarked, however, that many of the functions (e.g. simple animations) used 
in  such  book  apps  are/will  be  possible  also  with  EPUB  3.  However,  there 
are no reader applications on the market yet which can display all of these 
functions (as we have pointed out several times). For some of the advanced 
functions mentioned, book apps are therefore currently the only option.

5.2  eBook Streaming

Beyond  legal  considerations  when  an  ebook  download  might  be  seen  not 
as a purchase, but only as the use of a license (which is not the topic here), 
there is a further alternative option to realize ebooks. Rather than download 
ebook files and render them (or render them from a file in the cloud), it is 
also  possible  to  stream  ebook  contents  to  corresponding  viewing  applica-
tions.  This  option  –  streaming  not  continually,  but  in  a  request-response 
cycle  –  is  used  in  settings,  where  access  to  ebook  contents  is  not  granted 
for  good,  but  only  for  a  certain  period  of  time,  mostly  in  the  context  of 

40

ebook lending or flat rate schemes. Such services are offered by libraries, but 
also by certain publishers, online bookstores and specialized aggregators. If 
not taken care of with special mechanisms (e.g. for reading during a flight), 
streamed ebooks can of course only be read if the device is online. Since the 
streaming  arrangements  of  different  ebook  streaming  services  are  differ-
ent, they are not interoperable between them. Some of the ebook streaming 
viewing  applications  can,  however,  also  view  downloaded  EPUB  ebooks 
(from the traditional paradigm) and realize basic features with them.

6  Protection of Copyrighted Material

6.1  Overview

Many publishers and authors are interested in content protection as ebooks 
can  easily  be  reproduced  and  distributed.  Digital  rights  management 
(DRM) broadly refers to a set of policies, techniques and tools that guide the 
proper use of digital content [14]. Major functionalities of DRM systems are 
packaging of raw content into an appropriate form for easy distribution and 
tracking,  protecting  the  content  for  tamper-proof  transmission,  protect-
ing content from unauthorized use, and enabling specifications of suitable 
rights, which define the modes of content consumption. Probably the most 
relevant aspects for publishers and booksellers are that DRM systems allow 
them [14] 

•	

•	

to monitor the usage of content and ensure that they are in accordance 
with the rights of the users, 

to  track  payment  and  ensure  they  are  in  accordance  with  the  usage  of 
content, and 

•	

to manage security and privacy issues appropriately. 

We distinguish different types of mechanisms used by publishers and ebook 
distributors to protect copyrighted material: 

1.  honor system, 

2.  closed ecosystem, 

3.  digital watermarking, and 

4.  software-based protection using encryption. 

Honor  systems  do  not  enforce  protection  by  technical  features,  but  the 
copyright owner asks users to respect his intellectual property. An example 
is the novel The plant published in 2000 by Stephen King. King did not apply 
any technical DRM measures, but published the novel in separate chapters, 
continuing with the next chapter only if a certain number of users pay for the 
chapters already published. With the publication of the last chapter, many 
illegal copies of the book became available, rapidly reducing the willingness 
of the readers to pay for the content. Thus, King stopped the project.

Digital content can also be protected by creating a closed ecosystem. A closed 
ecosystem does not allow or makes it at least difficult for users to export or 
distribute content. An example of a closed ecosystem is Apple’s iTunes Store. 
Since 2009, all music titles sold through the iTunes Store are not protected 
by technical DRM measures. However, the ecosystem is closed as users can 
download  or  play  content  only  using  Apple  devices  or  software  (iTunes, 
iPhone, iPod, iPad, Apple TV). An export of content out of the Apple world 
is only possible by burning individual songs on a CD. Another instrument 

42 

Commissioned by the European & International Booksellers Federation

for  establishing  closed  ecosystems  is  the  use  of  proprietary  formats.  For 
example, the .ibooks format produced by the Apple authoring tool iBooks 
Author is incompatible with the EPUB 3 standard and can only be accessed 
in  Apple’s  ecosystem  through  the  Apple  iBookstore  using  Apple  devices 
(see Sect. 3.2.2). Although no hard DRM measures are used on the ebook 
files, a free distribution of content is not possible as all non-Apple devices 
or software readers cannot read the format. Important for establishing an 
effective closed ecosystem is a tight coupling between a store, where content 
is sold, and devices or software, that display the content.

A  specific  type  of  DRM  is  digital  watermarking.  Watermarking  does  not 
allow a publisher or ebook distributor to ensure a set of policies but allow 
a  posteriori  the  identification  of  users  which  do  not  follow  the  policies. 
Watermarking  inserts  user-specific  or  content-specific  information  into 
visible  or  invisible  ebook  data  like  cover  page,  figures,  video,  audio  files, 
fonts, or text. Watermarking does not prevent the unauthorized distribution 
and use of ebooks, however, it gives the publisher or distributor the possibil-
ity to reconstruct unauthorized distribution. There are two general types of 
watermarking: 

•	 Forensic watermarks are user-specific information embedded in a media 
file. The embedded information is only accessible if the user knows about 
it. Forensic watermarks are used by publishers or distributors to identify 
where the content file originates. Forensic watermarks should be robust 
against  removal  attacks  and  identify  information  about  the  copyright 
owner  for  the  watermarked  item.  Usually,  forensic  watermarks  are 
intended to track copies of the data, not to directly prevent the copying.

•	 Denial watermarks aim to protect content. Examples for audio formats 
are SACD and DVD Audio. Such systems combine watermarking with 
software  protection  (encryption).  End-user  devices  or  software  readers 
search  for  a  valid  watermark  in  the  content  and  forbid  access  to  the 
content if the watermark is not found. The production of a valid water-
mark involves secrets (e.g. keys) unavailable to the public. 

Software-based protection using encryption limits the use of content only 
to registered and authorized users. In a standard and representative DRM 
model, the content provider prepares the content in a format supported by 
the DRM system. Then, the digital content is encrypted and packaged for 
distribution. As discussed in the previous paragraph, the content provider 
may  add  digital  watermarks  to  the  file  to  allow  the  copyright  owner  to 
identify ownership of the files. Encrypted documents are not directly useful 
for consumers as they must be decrypted with a key corresponding to the 
encryption  key.  In  a  next  step,  the  encrypted  content,  together  with  keys 
for decryption and usage policies (number of copies, pay-per-view, etc.), is 
sent  to  a  clearinghouse.  The  consumer  can  now  stream  or  download  the 
protected  material  through  the  distributor  or  from  another  source.  To  be 
able  to  view  the  protected  material,  he  must  request  a  valid  licence  from 

Prof. Christoph Bläsi | Prof. Franz Rothlauf – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz 

43

the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse verifies the user’s identity, charges his 
account  based  on  the  content  usage  rules,  generates  a  transaction  report 
for the content provider, and delivers a decryption key that allows the user 
to access the content on his/her device [13]. A usage of content without the 
decryption key is not possible. To prohibit a usage of content by unauthor-
ized users who get access to the decryption key, the decryption key usually 
allows  decryption  of  content  only  on  specific  devices  (identified  by  their 
serial  ID)  or  for  a  specific  user  (identified  by  a  user  or  account  name).  A 
decryption  on  other  devices  with  a  different  ID  or  by  other  users  with  a 
different account name is not possible.

If the clearinghouse is different from the content provider, consumers can 
pass  along  received  digital  content  to  other  people  through  super-distri-
bution [13]. To utilize content, a recipient has to contact the clearinghouse 
and  provide  whatever  information  or  payment  is  required  for  the  license. 
However, in many closed ebook ecosystems the content provider is identical 
with  the  clearinghouse  and  a  free  exchange  of  books  between  consumers 
is not possible. For example, Apple’s iBookstore or Amazon do not use an 
external  clearinghouse  and  do  not  allow  the  transfer  of  ebooks  from  one 
customer to another. In addition, passing along content to a user outside the 
closed ecosystems is not offered and not intended.

6.2  Software-based DRM Schemes for eBooks

Closed ecosystems rely on a tight coupling between ebook store and reading 
devices. Additional instruments are incompatible formats and software-based 
protection using encryption and watermarking. In the following paragraphs, 
we  give  an  overview  about  the  current  software-based  DRM  schemes. 
There  are  four different DRM schemes available. Three of them are propri-
etary  (Amazon,  Apple’s  FairPlay,  and  Adobe  Digital  Experience  Protection 
Technology),  whereas  Marlin  is  an  open  standard  developed  by  the  Marlin 
Developer Community (MDC). Currently, the four different DRM schemes 
are  non-interoperable.  Thus,  DRM-protected  books  cannot  be  exchanged 
between the different DRM systems and ecosystems, respectively.

Amazon DRM

The DRM system used by Amazon is based on a DRM scheme developed 
by Mobipocket. Amazon applies the DRM scheme to all ebooks delivered 
through its Kindle Store (usually in KF8 format). A publicly available speci-
fication of Amazon’s DRM scheme is not available.

Technically, Amazon applies the DRM schemes to the AZW and KF8 format 
(see  Sect.  3.3),  where  the  AZW  format  is  an  encrypted  MOBI  format.  For 
Kindle devices, Amazon directly encrypts the container format (MOBI). The 
Kindle software reader uses a different DRM scheme, which is stronger than 
the DRM scheme for the Kindle devices, as it uses additional keys for each 
ebook instead of only one key decrypting the content on a Kindle device.

The  Amazon  DRM  ensures  that  DRM-protected  ebooks  can  only  be  read 
on  Kindle  devices  or  Amazon’s  reading  software  (available  for  all  major 
operating systems and devices) and non-Amazon ebooks cannot be read on 
any of Amazon’s Kindle devices or reading software. Amazon uses the user 
ID to identify a user and only allows the usage of content acquired by the 
user. Amazon does not allow a permanent transfer of ebooks bought in the 
Amazon Kindle Store to another user or any non-Amazon device or reader. 
Since  January  2011,  users  can  transfer  one  book  for  a  time  period  of  two 
weeks to exactly one other Amazon user.

Apple FairPlay

Apple uses a DRM scheme named Apple FairPlay. Apple FairPlay is applied 
to  all  content  that  is  sold  through  the  iBookstore  and  built  into  Apple’s 
standard  multimedia  software  QuickTime,  which  is  used  on  the  iPhone, 
iPod, iPad and the software reader iBooks. Apple’s FairPlay DRM is compat-
ible with the formats sold through the iBookstore, namely EPUB, .ibooks, 
and Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB. Analogously to Amazon, all books distrib-
uted through the iBookstore can only be used on Apple devices and readers.
However, in contrast to Amazon, Apple allows the import of EPUB and PDF 
files from non-Apple devices and readers.

FairPlay  encrypts  the  files  delivered  to  the  customer  and  embeds  digital 
watermarks  for  identification.  Official  specifications  of  the  DRM  mecha-
nisms are not publicly available, however there are some technical reports 
[9, 16]. FairPlay allows an unlimited number of copies of an ebook on one 
specific Apple device and a simultaneous use of an ebook on a maximum 
of  five  authorized  devices.  Meanwhile,  there  are  software  solutions  like 
calibre41  or  Requiem42  available,  which  allow  users  to  remove  the  DRM 
protection from books bought in the iBookstore. Of course, removing the 
DRM protection is against Apple’s terms of use.

Adobe Digital Experience Protection Technology

Adobe  offers  a  DRM  system  named  Adobe  Digital  Experience  Protection 
Technology (ADEPT) used by some booksellers and distributors for protecting 
mainly EPUB content. The DRM scheme can be applied to PDF, EPUB, and 
Flash.  The  DRM  scheme  can  be  read  by  Adobe  Digital  Edition,  which  is  an 
ebook reader developed by Adobe, and some other third-party ebook readers. 
ADEPT is the most commonly used DRM scheme besides Amazon and Apple.

ADEPT  allows  users  to  exchange  documents  between  up  to  six  comput-
ers.  Users  are  identified  by  their  Adobe  ID.  A  variant  of  ADEPT  is  used 
by  Barnes  &  Noble  for  their  reading  device  Nook  and  reading  software. 
Supported formats in the ebook store of Barnes & Noble are PDF and EPUB. 
Analogously to Amazon, ADEPT allows the lending of a book for two weeks 
to another user.

Marlin DRM

The Marlin Developer Community (MDC) developed an open DRM stand-
ard  named  Marlin43.  MDC  started  in  October  2008  with  five  members: 
Intertrust,  Panasonic,  Philips,  Samsung,  and  Sony.  Currently,  about  30 
companies are members of MDC. The design goals of Marlin are interoper-
ability and openness. Currently, Marlin is the only open DRM format for 
ebooks available.

The  Marlin  development  groups  provides  a  number  of  specifications  and 
tools,  including  conformance  test  suites,  reference  implementations,  and 
software  development  kits  necessary  to  create  DRM  content  distribution 
systems.  Marlin  allows  a  flexible  and  general-purpose  rights  management 
similar to Amazon, FairPlay, and ADEPT. Marlin emphasizes the interop-
erability  between  various  ecosystems  which  would  allow  users  to  transfer 
ebooks from one ecosystem into another. Marlin can also be used for deliv-
ering EPUB files as well as proprietary formats.

Currently,  Marlin  is  used  by  the  educational  ebook  reseller  Kno44,  which 
sells  ebooks  in  EPUB  format.  Kno’s  reading  application  is  available  for 
Apple iOS, Windows and Android.

6.3  Discussion

Currently,  the  closed  ecosystems  established  by  Amazon  and  Apple  are 
protected by the use of proprietary and non-interoperable DRM schemes. 
The  features  provided  by  Amazon  DRM,  Apple’s  FairPlay,  and  Adobe 
ADEPT  are  similar,  however  an  exchange  of  books  from  one  ecosystem 
into another is not possible. The open source DRM system Marlin aims for 
interoperability  and  openness,  however,  it  is  not  used  by  major  players  in 
the ebook market. The IDPF, which was successful in establishing EPUB as 
a relevant and platform-independent ebook standard, has not yet developed 
any standards or recommendations for DRM schemes45.

The  decision  of  an  ebook  provider  to  use  a  specific  ebook  format  is  inde-
pendent from the use of a specific DRM scheme. In principle, any existing 
DRM  scheme  can  be  applied  to  the  ebook  formats  EPUB,  KF8,  as  well  as 
Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks. However, in practice, Apple as well 
as  Amazon  use  proprietary  DRM  schemes  to  restrict  exchange  of  ebooks 
and to bind users to their ebook store.

Although Marlin is an alternative that would allow for an interoperability 
of  DRM-protected  ebooks,  a  free  exchange  of  ebooks  between  different 
platforms  is  unlikely.  For  interoperability,  the  different  ecosystems  must 
allow  users  to  import  and  export  ebooks  while  still  enforcing  the  DRM

restrictions.  From  a  technical  perspective  this  is  possible,  however,  the 
ecosystem owner must accept books that are sold outside its ecosystem and 
enforce usage restrictions that have been defined by a different ecosystem. 
From the business perspective of the major players in the ebook market, this 
is not attractive. Instead, they use incompatible DRM schemes to prohibit 
the free exchange of ebooks and to bind users to their own ecosystem.

7  Conclusions
A free choice on the part of customers between different ebook stores and 
retailers  is  only  possible  if  the  ebook  formats  used  are  interoperable  and 
the DRM mechanisms allow an easy exchange of files. With these criteria 
in mind, this report studies the interoperability of the major ebook formats 
– namely EPUB, KF8 (Amazon), Fixed Layout EPUB (Apple) – and .ibooks 
(Apple) and the interoperability of the DRM mechanisms used by the major 
retailers. From a format perspective, we answer the question whether the use 
of the open standard EPUB would allow publishers and authors to cover the 
superset of all functionalities of the proprietary formats KF8, Apple’s Fixed 
Layout EPUB, and .ibooks. From a DRM perspective, we examine what can 
be said concerning the possible protection of copyrighted material on the 
one  hand  and  the  functions  of  DRM  to  close  ecosystems.  The  interesting 
question is which DRM schemes allow interoperability between ebook eco-
systems.  Both  interoperable  formats  and  interoperable  DRM  mechanisms 
are a prerequisite for customers to have a free choice.

Consequently, the document starts with a historical overview of the devel-
opment of the open EPUB standard. This is followed in Sect. 3 by a detailed 
level description of the major formats: EPUB 3, Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB 
and  .ibooks,  and  KF8.  Sect.  4  changes  the  perspective  and  compares  the 
features provided by the different formats from the perspective of publish-
ers who want to see certain features in their content. This section looks at 
core  features,  multimedia  and  interactivity,  as  well  as  globalisation  and 
accessibility. Sect. 5 discusses alternative options, e.g. where ebook content 
is not rendered using a dedicated reader software, but content and viewer 
are packaged together as an ebook app. Sect. 6 compares the existing ebook 
DRM schemes; interoperable DRM systems are the second prerequisite of 
interoperability between different ebook ecosystems.

The main findings of this report are: 

•	 With  the  use  of  EPUB  3,  ebook  format  interoperability  is  possible 
between different ebook ecosystems. EPUB 3 is not only the format with 
the highest expressive power, but it includes the superset of all features 
of KF8, Fixed Layout EPUB, and .ibooks. This result is not surprising as 
KF8, Apple’s Fixed Layout EPUB, and .ibooks are descendants of earlier 
EPUB standards using the same or similar data structures.

•	 Instruments for building up closed ebook ecosystems are a tight coupling 
between reader devices and applications on the one hand and the store 
on the other, the impossibility of exporting ebooks, and restrictive DRM 
protection. The ebook retailer Apple supports the open EPUB standard 
and provides with the iBooks reader application one of the best EPUB 3 
reader  applications.  However,  Apple  established  a  closed  ecosystem,  as 
all ebooks created or distributed inside the Apple world are not allowed 
to leave the ecosystem and cannot be transferred to non-Apple devices. 
Apple’s  principal  means  of  creating  this  closed  ecosystem  is  the  Apple 

48 

Commissioned by the European & International Booksellers Federation

FairPlay  DRM,  which  controls  the  usage  of  content  on  Apple  devices. 
Thus,  ebooks  can  only  be  imported  into  the  ecosystem,  but  are  not 
allowed to leave it.

•	 Amazon has also built up a closed ecosystem. Analogously to Apple, it does 
not allow users to export or transfer ebooks to other ecosystems or users. 
The  Kindle  reader  devices  and  reader  applications  only  display  ebooks 
bought in the Amazon ebook store, and Amazon’s Kindle Store delivers 
content only to Amazon reader devices and applications. Analogously to 
Apple, the instruments for achieving a closed ecosystem are the impos-
sibility of exporting ebooks, the tight coupling between reader devices/
applications and the store, and DRM protection. Differently from Apple, 
Amazon  does  not  even  support  the  EPUB  standard,  but  uses  its  own 
proprietary and non-interoperable KF8 format. The use of a non-interop-
erable format strengthens the closeness of its ecosystem as it makes even 
non-DRM protected KF8 files unusable outside the Amazon ecosystem. 

There  is  little  official  or  publicly  available  documentation  regarding  the 
formats  KF8,  Apple  Fixed  Layout  EPUB,  and  .ibooks.  Even  on  request, 
Apple as well as Amazon did not provide any further technical documenta-
tion  concerning  the  formats.  Neither  Apple  nor  Amazon  commented  our 
results, in spite of explicitly being asked by us to do so. In the absence of 
documentation  and  as  a  result  of  DRM  protection,  national  libraries  and 
other institutions that preserve cultural heritage do not store ebooks in pro-
prietary formats. For example, the German National Library only archives 
ebooks in EPUB and PDF format.

In summary, we find that there are no technical or functional reasons not 
to use EPUB 3 as the interoperable ebook standard. Instead, Amazon and 
Apple use, propagate, and develop their proprietary formats mainly for mar-
ket-strategic reasons (and possibly downward compatibility). A short-term 
obstacle to widespread use is the non-availability of fully EPUB 3-compatible 
reading applications. This problem, however, should be resolved at the end 
of 2013 when fully EPUB 3-compatible reader applications are scheduled to 
be available (e.g. Kobo, Azardi, or Apple iBooks reader).

However, a widespread use of EPUB 3 will only lead to interoperable ebook 
ecosystems, if the currently closed ecosystems become open beyond issues 
of data formats. Open ecosystems would allow users to import and export 
ebooks  to  and  from  other  reader  devices  or  reader  applications.  Such  an 
exchange of ebooks between different systems and users makes it necessary 
to also exchange information about the DRM schemes between the differ-
ent ecosystems. From a technical perspective, this is possible as the DRM 
features provided by the existing proprietary DRM schemes are similar and 
there even exists an open source DRM system (Marlin) aiming for interop-
erability and openness. However, the current business models of the main 
players  in  the  ebook  market  aiming  at  lock-in  effects  for  the  customer  do 
not fit with open ecosystems. A prominent example is Apple, which actively

supports the EPUB 3 standard and uses it for some of its ebook distribution, 
but keeps its ecosystem closed by the use of a DRM system which restricts 
the exchange of files, including of course ebooks. To reach true interoper-
ability in the ebook market, the major retailers must agree on interoperable 
ebook formats and interoperable DRM schemes.

It is widely seen as a serious problem that European as well as international 
customers who have bought an ebook from one of the international ebook 
retailers  implicitly  subscribe  to  this  retailer  as  their  sole  future  ebook 
supplier, i.e. in effect, they forego buying future ebooks from any other 
supplier.

This is a threat to the qualified European book distribution infrastructure 
and hence the European book culture, since subscribers to one of these 
ebook  ecosystems  cannot  buy  future  ebooks  from  privately  owned 
community-located  bricks  &  mortar  booksellers  engaging  in  ebook 
retailing. This view is completely in line with the Digital Agenda of the 
European Commission calling in Pillar II for “an effective interoperability 
between IT products and services to build a truly digital society. Europe 
must  ensure  that  new  IT  devices,  applications,  data  repositories  and 
services interact seamlessly anywhere – just like the Internet.”

Amazon’s Monopoly Tollbooth 
Amazon’s dominance of online retail means that hundreds of thousands 
of small businesses must rely on its site to reach customers. In this 
report, we find that Amazon is exploiting its gatekeeper power to extract 
a growing cut of the revenue earned by these sellers. It’s doing this by 
imposing ever-larger fees on them. This tactic is hobbling sellers and 
often dooming their businesses. It’s also enabling Amazon to entrench 
its monopoly grip on e-commerce, while expanding its dominance into 
logistics and advertising. 

By Stacy Mitchell, Ron Knox, and Zach Freed
July 2020

 
Key Findings: 

•  Amazon  keeps  an  average  of  30  percent  of 
each sale made by independent sellers on its 
site, up from 19 percent just five years ago.

•  Seller fees netted Amazon almost $60 billion in 
2019, nearly double the $35 billion in revenue 
from AWS, Amazon’s massive cloud computing 
division.

•  Amazon  has  leveraged  its  captive  base  of 
sellers  to  build  a  dominant  logistics  business. 
It’s now delivering half of the items ordered on 
its site and a growing share of those purchased 
on other sites. Amazon has already overtaken 
the U.S. Postal Service in the large e-commerce 
parcel  market,  and  it’s  expected  to  surpass 
UPS and FedEx by 2022. 

•  Since 2014, Amazon’s revenue from seller fees 
has  grown  almost  twice  as  fast  as  its  overall 
sales.  Seller  fees  now  account  for  21  percent 
of Amazon’s total revenue. 

•  Amazon  is  extracting  more  from  sellers  by 
tying  their  ability  to  generate  sales  on  its 
site  to  their  willingness  to  buy  additional 
Amazon  services,  including  its  fulfillment  and 
advertising services. 

•  Amazon’s high fees make it nearly impossible 
for  sellers  to  sustain  a  profitable  business. 
Most  fail.  Yet  Amazon  has  no  risk  of  running 
out  of  sellers;  its  monopoly  ensures  there’s 
an  endless  stream  of  people,  both  here  and 
abroad, willing to try.

•  Amazon’s revenue from seller fees has grown 
large  that  sellers  are  effectively  cross-
so 
subsidizing Amazon’s retail division. Last year, 
seller  fees  covered  more  than  three-quarters 
of  Amazon’s  total  shipping  and  fulfillment 
expenses, including the costs of operating its 
warehouses,  providing  customer  service,  and 
processing payments. 

•  The  policy  solution  to  Amazon’s  exploitation 
of  its  gatekeeper  power  must  be  twofold. 
its  marketplace  platform  should  be 
First, 
subject  to  public  utility-like  standards  of  non-
discrimination  and  fair  pricing.  Second,  its 
various divisions must be spun off into separate 
companies  to  eliminate  conflicts  of  interest 
and monopoly leveraging.

oug Mrdeza remembers 
what life was like the year 
his company appeared on 

Inc. magazine’s list of America’s 
fastest growing private companies. 

“It  was  like  living  the  dream,”  he  says.  “I  loved  doing  what  I 
did.” That was 2018. The tiny business Mrdeza had launched 
five  years  earlier  out  of  his  house  in  Lansing,  Mich.,  had 
swelled  to  nearly  50  employees.  Called  Top  Shelf  Brands, 
the company was a modern, tech-infused iteration of a Main 
Street retailer. It sold hair care products online, mainly as a 
third-party  seller  on  Amazon,  and  relied  on  algorithms  to 
continually  adjust  prices  and  manage  inventory.  Top  Shelf 
did more than $23 million in sales in 2018. 

Today  that  seems  like  a  distant  dream.  Mrdeza  has  had 
to  lay  off  all  but  five  employees  and  is  working  to  avoid 
bankruptcy. What doomed Mrdeza’s business was Amazon’s 
market power. Like most e-commerce businesses, Top Shelf 
Brands has to go through Amazon to reach the vast majority 
of  its  customers.  That’s  because  more  than  60  percent  of 
Americans  who  want  to  buy  something  online  start  their 
product  search  on  Amazon,  rather  than  a  search  engine.1 
In 15 of 23 major product categories, Amazon is capturing 
more than 70 percent of online transactions.2 Although Top 
Shelf also sells on Walmart and eBay, these platforms are a 
very distant second and third in traffic to Amazon, and they 
generate  only  a  small  sliver  of  Top  Shelf’s  sales.  In  other 
words, Amazon so dominates online shopping traffic that it 
has become a gatekeeper. 

As  this  report  shows,  Amazon  is  exploiting  its  gatekeeper 
power to siphon off a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue 
earned  by  independent  sellers  on  its  site.  It’s  doing  this 
through  the  fees  that  it  charges  them.  In  effect, Amazon  is 
levying a hefty tax on their trade — enabling it to profit from 
their businesses at the same time that it saddles them with 
more  costs  and  thus  weakens  them  as  rivals.  Over  the  last 
five years, Amazon’s revenue from seller fees grew roughly 
twice  as  fast  as  its  overall  sales.  Seller  fees  netted Amazon 
almost $60 billion in 2019 — nearly double the $35 billion in 
revenue from its massive cloud computing division, Amazon 
Web Services (AWS). 

given much more favorable positioning on the site and thus 
are significantly more likely to make sales. One is Fulfillment 
By  Amazon  (FBA),  Amazon’s  service  for  warehousing  and 
shipping  sellers’  products.  The  other  is  Amazon’s  product 
advertising, which takes up a growing share of the space on 
its search results pages. 

Through the combination of these fees, Amazon is keeping 
an average of 30 percent of each sale made by a third-party 
seller  on  its  site.  That’s  up  from  19  percent  just  five  years 
ago.  This  increase  in  fees  crippled  Mrdeza’s  business.  As 
Amazon  pocketed  more  of  its  revenue,  Top  Shelf  slipped 
from  being  modestly  profitable  to  losing  money.  Even  as 
sales  were  soaring  in  2018, Top  Shelf  was  deep  in  the  red. 
Mrdeza  found  that  raising  the  prices  of  his  products  on 
Amazon’s  site  to  account  for  these  added  costs  wasn’t  an 
option. That’s because if a seller offers a product at a higher 
price on Amazon than it charges on other platforms, Amazon 
penalizes  the  business  by  suppressing  the  visibility  of  its 
products and dramatically reducing their sales.3 

Mrdeza’s story is a familiar one to the tens of thousands of 
small businesses that have tried to succeed in an e-commerce 
market  dominated  by  Amazon.  The  vast  majority  of  those 
who  start  selling  on  Amazon’s  site  fail  within  a  few  years. 
Nearly  two-thirds  of  third-party  revenue  on  Amazon  goes 
to sellers who began selling on the site within the last three 
years. Sellers who’ve been operating for five or more years 
account for only 10 percent of sales.4 The way to understand

may  appear  to  succeed  at  first,  generating  sales  on  the 
site,  but  soon  find  that Amazon’s  fees  and  policies  make  it 
nearly impossible to sustain a profitable business. Selling on 
Amazon  is  like  going  to  a  casino:  you  might  win  a  hand  or 
two, but, in the end, only the house actually makes money. 

Selling on Amazon is like going to a casino: 
you might win a hand or two, but, in the 
end, only the house actually makes money.

Amazon  has  argued  that  “if  sellers  weren’t  succeeding, 
they  wouldn’t  be  here,”  in  the  words  of  Jeff  Wilke,  the 
chief  executive  of  Amazon’s  consumer  business.5  But  in 
fact,  between  the  large  share  of  jobs  that  pay  low  wages 
and  the  many  struggling  brick-and-mortar  retailers,  there’s 
an  endless  stream  of  people  in  the  U.S.  hoping  to  build 
businesses selling online. And if that pipeline falters, Amazon 
already  has  another  one  in  place.  In  2013,  the  company 
began cultivating sellers in China and has set up an ocean 
shipping  operation  that  allows  sellers  there  to  feed  their 
goods  directly  into  Amazon’s  U.S.  distribution  system.6  By 
January 2020, China-based sellers accounted for 49 percent 
of the top 10,000 sellers in Amazon’s U.S. marketplace.7 

How Amazon Taxes Sellers to Fuel Its 
Monopoly Strategy

Last year, in his annual letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO 
Jeff  Bezos  reported  that  third-party  sellers  accounted  for 
58  percent  of  sales  on  Amazon,  up  from  46  percent  five 
years  before.  Then,  in  reference  to  the  growth  of  these 
sales relative to sales by Amazon’s own retail division (“first-
party”  sales),  he  said:  “Third-party  sellers  are  kicking  our 
first-party butt.”

It  was  a  smugly  condescending  remark,  made  from  the 
vantage point of having firm control over the fates of third-
party  sellers.  Through  its  algorithms,  which  control  search 
and product pages, and its fee structures and other dictates, 
Amazon can steer consumers to third-party sellers, or to the 
products  it’s  selling  itself,  depending  on  which  best  serves 
its  own  interests.  It  has  allowed  third-party  sales  to  grow 
because  they’re  extremely  lucrative,  and  because  Amazon 
can  leverage  its  power  over  these  smaller  businesses  to 
expand its market dominance.

With third-party sales, Amazon takes its cut right off the top, 
regardless  of  the  seller’s  costs  and  margins.  It  incurs  none 
of the expenses of researching and sourcing products and 
investing  in  inventory,  and  carries  none  of  the  risk  that  the 
goods won’t sell. Just as Amazon uses temporary and “gig” 
workers  to  dodge  costs  and  responsibility  in  its  logistics 
operations, it uses third-party sellers to offload the expense 
of  inventory,  while  profiting  from  their  product  knowledge, 
market insights, and entrepreneurial drive. 

Our  analysis  finds  that,  last  year,  Amazon  netted  nearly  $60 
billion from the tolls it levied on third-party sellers, including 
referral  fees,  storage  and  shipping  fees,  advertising,  and 
other charges.8 That’s significantly more than the $35 billion 
in revenue the tech giant earned from Amazon Web Services 
(AWS), 
its  massive  cloud  computing  operation,  which 
controls nearly half of the world’s public cloud capacity and 
provides the computing infrastructure for a huge number of 
corporations.9 Seller fees accounted for more than one-fifth of 
Amazon’s total revenue in 2019, up from 14 percent in 2014.

Over  the  last  five  years, Amazon’s  revenue  from  seller  fees 
has  grown  two-and-a-half  times  as  fast  as  total  consumer 
spending on its site. In other words, Amazon’s fee revenue 
is increasing in large part because it is taking a larger cut of 
every  dollar  sellers  make  on  the  site.  Five  years  ago,  third-
party  sellers  handed  Amazon  about  $19  of  every  $100  in 
sales they made on the site. Today, it’s over $30. 

Amazon’s Monopoly TollboothWWW.ILSR.ORGThe Short Lifecycle of a Third-Party Seller

But  in  2018,  even  as  his  sales  were  soaring,  Mrdeza’s  business 
was failing — in large part because of Amazon itself. Amazon was 
pocketing a growing share of Top Shelf’s sales through the fees it 
charged the company. The fees for FBA, Amazon’s warehousing 
and shipping service, had shot up. And, as Amazon turned over 
more of the real estate on its site to sponsored product ads, Top 
Shelf found it had to buy ads from Amazon to reach customers, 
which meant more fees. 

When  Mrdeza  was  just  starting  out,  in  2014,  Amazon  fees  ate 
up  35  percent  of  Top  Shelf’s  revenue.  By  2018,  Amazon’s  cut 
had  swelled  to  more  than  46  percent.  After  Top  Shelf  paid  its 
suppliers, that left just 13 percent of its revenue to cover payroll 
and the rest of its expenses. In other words, Amazon was netting 
significantly  more  revenue  from  Top  Shelf’s  business  than  the 
company and its employees were. Top Shelf eked out a modest 
profit  in  2016  and  2017,  but  by  2018,  it  was  losing  money. 
Although Mrdeza tried to expand sales on other platforms, such 
as EBay, and its own site, more than 90 percent of its revenue was 
coming from Amazon.

On top of paying Amazon’s rising tolls, Mrdeza and his staff were 
spending  a  lot  of  time  correcting  errors  in  Amazon’s  system  — 
errors  that  always  seemed  to  fall  in  Amazon’s  favor.  Top  Shelf 
would  ship  220  units  of  a  hair  gel  to  an  Amazon  warehouse, 
but  only  200  would  show  up  as  inventory  in  Seller  Central, 
Amazon’s portal for sellers. Getting the other 20 accounted for 
would require filing a case through Amazon’s opaque in-house 
adjudication  system.  Or  sometimes  Amazon  would  suddenly 
start charging $3.03 to pack and ship an item that it had been 
shipping for $2.50. Top Shelf would log a case in Seller Central 
asking Amazon to measure the item again, and the price would 
come back down. But then Top Shelf would have to file another 
case requesting a refund for the overcharges. 

At some point, Mrdeza realized that he could hire an engineer 
to  write  code  to  analyze  the  data  and  automatically  file  cases 
when there was a discrepancy. But then he learned that Amazon, 
famous for running its far-flung empire with complex algorithms 
that  govern  everything  from  product  pricing  to  employee 
terminations,  doesn’t  allow  sellers  to  use  automated  programs 
to create cases within Seller Central.

If  you  “actually  add  up  all  the  ways Amazon  nickels  and  dimes 
you…  you  can’t  make  money,”  Mrdeza  says.  With  the  business 
deep  in  the  red,  Mrdeza  spent  2019  trying  to  right  the  ship  — 
but, he says, Amazon’s heads-we-win, tails-you-lose policies have 
made it impossible. 

Before  starting  Top  Shelf  Brands,  Doug  Mrdeza  had  been  a 
barber.  The  hair  care  products  he  stocked  in  his  shop  didn’t 
always sell, and that’s how he found his way into online retail. 
One  day  he  decided  to  try  selling  surplus  jars  of  pomade 
on  eBay.  It  worked.  Soon  Mrdeza  was  spending  some  of  his 
evenings  selling  on  eBay,  boxing  up  and  mailing  goods  as 
the  orders  came  in.  But  selling  on  eBay  was  a  small  sideline; 
it  didn’t  generate  enough  income  to  leave  his  day  job. Then, 
in  2014,  he  heard  about  Fulfillment  By  Amazon,  or  “FBA,”  a 
program that allows companies like his to send their inventory 
to Amazon and let it handle the packing and shipping. “I sent 
in  enough  inventory  for  what  would  normally  be  a  month  of 
sales,” Mrdeza recalls. “It was gone in an hour.”

On  Amazon,  Mrdeza’s  business  took  off.  More  than  a  dozen 
brands partnered with Top Shelf to represent their products on 
Amazon. The company outgrew one space in Lansing, and then 
another, eventually expanding to more than 45 employees. “I 
felt great being an employer and providing a living for people,” 
Mrdeza says. A job at Top Shelf came with health insurance and 
a 401k plan. “We’re not the kind of people who want to take this 
money and put it in our jeans,” Mrdeza says of his management 
team. “We want everyone to do well.” 

Top  Shelf  Brands  seemed  to  be  the  picture  of  what  Amazon 
claims  it  does  for  small  businesses.  Amazon  features  small 
businesses  heavily  in  both  its  marketing  and  its  lobbying. 
Amazon  says  that  it  enables  entrepreneurs  to  “follow  their 
dreams” and that many are “thriving” by selling on Amazon.10 
Mrdeza himself was one of Amazon’s top boosters. “I used to 
tell everyone how great Amazon is,” he says.

Amazon’s Monopoly TollboothWWW.ILSR.ORGAmazon’s profit margins on seller fees are about 20 percent, 
or four times higher than its margins on its own retail sales, 
according  to  analysts  at  Morgan  Stanley.11  Because  of  its 
market dominance, Amazon faces little risk of losing sellers 
to  a  competing  platform  if  it  overcharges.  Its  policy  of 
penalizing sellers who charge less on other sites also means 
that Amazon’s fees are almost certainly being absorbed by 
consumers in the form of higher prices, not just on Amazon, 
but on other platforms as well. 

Amazon’s  revenue  from  seller  fees  has  grown  so  large  that 
sellers are now effectively cross-subsidizing Amazon’s retail 
division. The $59.5 billion that Amazon took in seller fees last 
year covered more than three-quarters of its total fulfillment 
and  shipping  expenses.12  These  expenses  include  most  of 
Amazon’s e-commerce costs, including the costs of operating 
its  distribution  facilities,  shipping  and  delivering  products, 
providing customer service, and processing payments. This 
suggests that sellers cover the distribution expenses for their 
own sales and cover a substantial portion of Amazon’s first-
party  expenses.  Amazon  not  only  competes  with  sellers,  it 
subsidizes that competition through the fees they pay.

As this report shows, Amazon’s exploitation of sellers is about 
more  than  extracting  revenue  from  them.  Amazon  is  also 
leveraging its dominance over sellers to gain market power 
in  other  sectors,  furthering  its  monopoly  strategy.  Amazon 
has, for example, compelled sellers to buy its warehousing 
and fulfillment services in order to get the kind positioning 
on its site that leads to sales. Almost overnight this move has

catapulted Amazon to being a top logistics provider without 
having  to  compete  for  it.  Amazon  has  built  a  large  digital 
advertising  business  in  much  the  same  way:  by  flexing  its 
muscle over sellers and brands. 

Amazon’s revenue from seller fees has 
grown so large that sellers are now 
effectively cross-subsidizing Amazon’s 
retail division.

Amazon  has  faced  growing  scrutiny  in  recent  months  for 
spying on sellers and using the insights it gleans from them 
to  develop  its  own  competing  versions  of  their  products.13 
But  Amazon’s  monopoly  strategy  is  far  more  complex 
and  multidimensional  than  this  single  tactic  suggests.  By 
integrating its various divisions — marketplace, retail, private 
label,  logistics,  advertising,  and  more  —  Amazon  gains 
multiple points of leverage, which it exploits with finesse. It 
leverages  its  private  label  products  to  pressure  vendors  to 
agree to its terms. It leverages its retail division to manipulate 
sellers  in  its  marketplace.  It  leverages  its  marketplace  to 
build a logistics empire. And, increasingly, it’s leveraging its 
logistics operation to fortify its monopoly in online retail. 

All  of  this  suggests  that  policy  solution  to  Amazon’s 
exploitation  of  the  retailers  and  brands  subject  to  its 
gatekeeper  power  must  be  twofold.  First,  its  marketplace 
platform  should  be  subject  to  public  utility-like  standards 
of  non-discrimination,  fair  dealing,  and  reasonable  pricing. 
And  second,  its  various  divisions  must  be  spun  off  into 
separate  companies  to  eliminate  the  conflicts  of  interest 
and  monopoly  leveraging  that  their  integration  invites  
and entails. 

Amazon’s Baseline Tax: Referral Fees

Amazon’s baseline tax, called its “referral fee,” takes a cut from 
every  sale  made  on  its  marketplace.  It’s  a  tax  no  seller  can 
avoid. For most products, Amazon’s cut is 15 percent. A few 
categories,  such  as  clothing,  have  higher  fees  (17  percent), 
and a few, such as cameras, have lower fees (8 percent). 

What’s  remarkable  about  Amazon’s  referral  fees  is  that 
they’ve  remained  at  the  same  level,  more  or  less,  for  20 
years.  When  Amazon  launched  its  Marketplace  for  sellers 
in 2000, its standard fee was 15 percent.14  Since then, the 
corporation has grown a hundredfold. Given its low marginal 
costs — processing additional sales on the site creates very 

Amazon’s Monopoly TollboothWWW.ILSR.ORGlittle additional expense – and ability to spread its fixed costs 
across far more transactions, Amazon’s growth should have 
yielded  a  decline  in  fees.  And  yet,  Amazon’s  15  percent 
cut  has  held  firm,  suggesting  that  there  is  no  competitive 
pressure for it to lower prices. 

Molson Hart, chief executive of Viahart, a toy company, says 
Amazon’s high referral fees lead to higher consumer prices. 
He  gives  the  example  of  a  three-foot-long  plush  tiger  toy, 
which retails on Amazon for $150. Between the $22.50 referral 
fee and another $17.58 Viahart pays in advertising costs so 
the tiger appears on Amazon’s search results page (more on 
this below), Amazon is keeping about $40 of each sale. “We 
designed, manufactured, imported, stored, shipped the item, 
and  then  we  did  customer  service.  Amazon  hosted  some 
images, swiped a credit card, and got $40,” Hart notes.15  

In theory, Viahart could sell the tiger for just $113 on its own 
website and still make the same profit. But Amazon effectively 
blocks it from doing so. Under Amazon’s “fair pricing” policy, 
if  Amazon  detects  a  lower  price  for  a  product  elsewhere,  it 
will suppress the visibility and sales of the item on its site by 
demoting  it  in  search  results,  deleting  its  Prime  badge,  or 
removing the “buy now/add to cart” buttons from the product 
page.16  Viahart  cannot  afford  to  risk  any  of  these  actions: 
Amazon accounts for more than 90 percent of its sales.

The Tax that Built Amazon’s Logistics 
Empire: Fulfillment Fees

In 2006, Amazon launched Fulfillment By Amazon, or FBA.17 
Sellers  who  sign  up  for  the  service  can  send  their  items  to 
Amazon’s  warehouses  and  pay  it  to  store,  pack,  and  ship 
their orders. 

During the early years of the program, relatively few sellers 
signed  up  for  it.  Many  could  obtain  better  rates  or  service 
from other warehouse operators and parcel carriers. Or they 
simply preferred to maintain control over their own inventory, 
shipping,  and  customer  service,  rather  than  turning  over 
these functions to Amazon.

But beginning in 2011, factors other than price, service, and 
preference  began  to  drive  sellers  to  use  FBA.  That’s  the 
year  that  Amazon  began  a  serious  push  to  grow  Prime,  its 
membership  program,  by  adding  a  host  of  new  perks.  By 
2013, the number of Prime members in the U.S. had grown 
to 25 million. Over the next three years, membership more 
than doubled, to 65 million in 2016, and then almost doubled 
again, to 112 million in 2019.18 

As  more  shoppers  subscribed  to  Prime,  they  looked  for 
products with the Prime badge, which Amazon would deliver 
in two days at no extra cost. This gave sellers a powerful reason 
to  sign  up  for  FBA:  their  items  would  qualify  for  the  Prime 
badge and attract Amazon’s audience of Prime subscribers. 
To  further  prod  sellers  to  use  FBA,  Amazon  embedded  a 
preference  for  those  who  use  the  service  into  its  “buy  box” 
algorithm. Its site uses this algorithm to control which seller 
is chosen as the default option for a particular product. This 
is known as securing the “buy box” and, with it, comes one-
click ordering. It makes all the difference for a seller’s bottom 
line: more than 80 percent of the time, shoppers choose the 
default seller. Signing up for FBA makes it far more likely that 
a seller will “win” the buy box.19 

In  effect,  Amazon  made  a  seller’s  ability  to  generate  sales 
on  its  marketplace,  which  dominates  e-commerce  traffic, 
contingent on buying Amazon’s warehousing and shipping 
services.  Not  surprisingly,  the  number  of  sellers  using  FBA 
has  risen  rapidly.  More  than  85  percent  of  the  top  10,000 
sellers  on  Amazon  rely  on  Prime  shipping,  up  from  56 
percent  in  2016.20  This  kind  of  leveraging  is  known  as 
“tying”  in  antitrust  law.  Amazon  CEO  Jeff  Bezos  has  openly 
described  the  strategy.  “FBA  is  so  important  because  it  is 
glue  that  inextricably  links  Marketplace  and  Prime.  Thanks 
to  FBA,  Marketplace  and  Prime  are  no  longer  two  things,” 
he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in 2015. “Their 
economics…are now happily and deeply intertwined.”

Amazon’s Monopoly TollboothWWW.ILSR.ORG 
Flexing its muscle as a gatekeeper to compel sellers to buy 
its FBA services has created a lucrative new revenue stream 
for  Amazon.  In  its  financials,  Amazon  does  not  break  out 
seller fee revenue by category, but we estimate that FBA fees 
account for about half of Amazon’s fee revenue from sellers, 
and that its revenue from FBA fees has risen sharply over the 
last  five  years,  growing  from  roughly  $3  billion  in  2014  to 
roughly $29 billion in 2019. 

This  growth  has  been  driven  in  part  by  the  increase  in  the 
number  of  sellers  buying  Amazon’s  fulfillment  services.  It’s 
also been driven by a steep rise in the prices that Amazon 
charges  for  these  services.  Between  2013  and  2019,  the 
standard rate for storing inventory in Amazon’s warehouses 
during  off-peak  months  rose  67  percent.  For  the  peak 
months  of  October  through  December,  the  rate  soared  by 
300  percent.  Storage  rates  for  standard-sized  items  (those 
under 20 pounds and within certain dimensions) are now 75 
cents per cubic foot per month during the first part of the year 
and  $2.40  during  the  peak  season.  Amazon’s  storage  fees 
are much higher than those of its competitors, according to 
several sources.21 A 2019 survey of 600 warehouses across 
the U.S. and Canada, for example, found an average rate of 
50 cents per cubic foot.22 

The prices Amazon charges to pack and ship an item have 
likewise  risen.  We  took  a  diverse  mix  of  34  products  — 
ranging from small items, such as a memory card, to larger 
items,  such  as  a  cookware  set,  to  oversized  goods,  like  a 
mini-trampoline — and calculated Amazon’s fees for shipping 
them in 2013, 2016, and 2020. Prices across the board went 
up.  The  size  of  the  increase  varied  widely,  but  the  median 
increase for an item was 55 percent. (See the table at the end 
of this report for the list of items and their FBA fees.) 

“On a dollars and cents side, it’s not that competitive,” says 
Matthew  White,  a  strategist  with  iDrive,  a  consulting  firm 
that  provides  guidance  to  companies  on  their  shipping 
options  and  helps  them  negotiate  contracts  with  carriers. 
“I’d  recommend  Amazon  if  they  were  really  good  on  price, 
but they’re not. If it weren’t for the algorithm, if it weren’t for 
the fifty-plus pressure points that Amazon is placing on the 
business, FBA wouldn’t be attractive.”

To do this, Amazon has built hundreds of package sortation 
and delivery centers across the country, and it’s established 
its own network of contracted delivery providers who deliver 
packages solely for Amazon. 

Thanks  to  its  market  power  over  sellers, Amazon’s  logistics 
operation  now  rivals  the  top  carriers  in  scale.  In  2019, 
Amazon delivered 2.5 billion parcels, or about one-fifth of all 
e-commerce deliveries, according to an analysis by Morgan 
Stanley, which expects Amazon to overtake UPS and FedEx in 
market share by 2022.24 It’s already overtaken the U.S. Postal 
Service, which, last year, saw its parcel volume fall for the first 
time in nearly a decade, adding to its financial woes.25 

Amazon  has  thus  leveraged  its  dominance  over  online 
shopping  and  its  captive  audience  of  sellers  to  rapidly 
become a huge player in package delivery – and it’s financed 
the necessary infrastructure on the backs of sellers. “It is a very 
effective way of driving their logistics business,” says White. 

Amazon Logistics has already overtaken the 
U.S. Postal Service, which, last year, saw its 
parcel volume fall for the first time in nearly 
a decade, adding to its financial woes.

To further fortify its position in logistics, Amazon has curtailed 
Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP), a program that allows elite sellers 
to  earn  the  Prime  badge  if  they  can  consistently  meet  the 
2-day shipping time using other carriers. Amazon launched 
the program in 2015, before it had built out its own package 
delivery capacity. In February 2019, it stopped allowing new 
sellers to sign up.26 Then, last fall, Amazon began threatening 
to revoke the Prime status of some SFP sellers, citing minor 
infractions, unless they switched from buying postage from 
the  U.S.  Postal  Service  to  buying  it  from  Amazon,  often 
at  higher  rates.27  Then  in  December,  at  the  height  of  the 
holiday season, Amazon told SFP sellers that they could not 
ship Prime orders via FedEx’s ground service and could only 
use its more expensive express service.28 

This  tactic  has  enabled  Amazon  to  rapidly  gain  market 
share  in  the  logistics  sector  without  having  to  compete  for 
it. When Amazon first launched FBA, it stored products and 
packed orders in its warehouses, but relied on other carriers, 
including the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx, to handle 
shipping  and  delivery.  That’s  changed.  Today,  a  growing 
share  of  the  products  sold  on Amazon  are  shipped  by  the 
company itself. Last year, Amazon delivered about half of its 
own packages, up from 15 percent just two years before.23 

White says Amazon is pressuring his SFP clients by holding 
them  to  an  on-time  delivery  rate  of  98.5  percent,  which  is 
substantially higher than Amazon itself achieves. According 
to data from market-research firm Rakuten Intelligence, the 
share of Amazon packages arriving late tripled between 2017 
and 2019, rising to 16.6 percent of orders.29 But SFP sellers 
who have a few delays can suddenly find themselves losing

it’s 
As  Amazon  becomes  more  dominant 
increasingly 
its 
leveraging  that  dominance  to 
monopoly power in online shopping. In other words, these 
two parts of Amazon are functioning as a monopoly feedback 
loop. Here’s one example of how this works. For many sellers, 
Amazon fulfills all of their orders, including those generated 
on other sites, such as EBay. This is because it’s not affordable 
or feasible for these small businesses to maintain sufficient 
inventory  across  warehouses  in  more  than  one  system. 
Amazon compels them to use FBA and then charges much 
higher prices to pack and ship their “multi-channel” orders. 
It charges 66 percent more, for example, to ship a modestly 
sized  item,  such  as  a  shirt  or  a  book,  purchased  on  EBay 
than one ordered on Amazon. Through its logistics division, 
Amazon bolsters its e-commerce dominance by raising the 
cost of selling on other platforms, while also reaping valuable 
insights about sales made through these other channels. 

These two divisions — FBA and Marketplace — work in tandem 
to  entrench  Amazon’s  power  in  e-commerce  and  build  its 
power as a warehousing and shipping service. “It’s not just 
about money. It’s about control,” White says. “Amazon knows 
it  can  always  be  getting  maximum  value  if  it  controls  that 
entire chain from payment through delivery.” 

Tightening the Screws: Sponsored 
Product Advertising

Amazon’s advertising business is its latest tool for squeezing 
more revenue from the small businesses that depend on its 
site  to  reach  customers.  Just  as  Amazon  has  done  with  its 
fulfilment  business,  it  is  increasingly  tying  a  seller’s  ability 
to  generate  sales,  and  thus  its  survival,  to  the  purchase  of 
advertising on its site. 

to  organic  results.30  As  a  consequence,  sellers  that  do  not 
advertise are generating fewer clicks on their product pages. 
Between  2017  and  2019,  the  share  of  product  page  views 
that  came  from  customers  clicking  on  ads  nearly  tripled, 
rising from 4 percent to 11 percent.31  

Amazon doesn’t break out its advertising revenue separately, 
but  according  to  eMarketer,  advertising  accounts  for  more 
than 70 percent of the revenue in its “Other” category and 
most of its ad revenue comes from sponsored listings on its 
site.32 Assuming that third-party sellers’ share of this revenue 
equals  their  share  of  retail  sales  on Amazon’s  platform,  we 
estimate that Amazon’s advertising revenue from sellers has 
grown  from  about  $1  billion  in  2016  to  nearly  $6  billion  in 
2019.  (The  remainder  of  Amazon’s  sponsored  advertising 
revenue  comes  from  brands  that  are  supplying  Amazon’s 
retail division as vendors.) 

Sellers that decline to advertise risk losing 
their place in Amazon’s organic search 
results, no matter how many glowing 
customer reviews they have.

As with every component of Amazon’s marketplace strategy, 
its  advertising  business  is  structured  to  reinforce  its  other 
mechanisms  of  dominance  and  extraction.  Sellers  cannot, 
for  example,  advertise  a  product  unless  they  have  secured 
the  “buy  box”  for  that  item  —  that  is,  they’ve  been  chosen 
by Amazon’s algorithm to be the one-click shopping option 
for  that  product.33  As  we  discussed  above,  sellers  that 
buy  Amazon’  fulfillment  services  stand  a  better  chance  of 
winning the buy box. To succeed, then, sellers not only need 
to buy the advertising, but in many cases they also need to 
buy Amazon’s fulfillment services; otherwise their ads won’t 
actually appear in the search results. 

Amazon  launched  its  digital  advertising  business  in  2012, 
but only began to focus on growing it in the last few years. 
Most  of  the  company’s  ad  revenue  comes  from  sponsored 
brand  and  product  advertisements  —  the  ads  that  typically 
appear on its search results pages, usually at the top of the 
page  and  also  interspersed  with  the  products  featured  by 
Amazon in its organic search results. These ads ensure that 
the first thing a customer sees are products from sellers and 
brands that bought the space. 

Sellers  that  decline  to  advertise  risk  losing  their  place  in 
Amazon’s  organic  search  results,  no  matter  how  many 
glowing  customer  reviews  they  have.  That’s  because  the 
Amazon  algorithm  that  delivers  the  search  results  favors 
products  with  more  sales.  As  more  orders  are  driven  by 
ads, sellers than don’t advertise lose out on those sales and, 
as  their  share  of  sales  declines,  they  also  slip  in  the  search 
rankings, further reducing their sales in a negative cycle. 

Over  the  last  few  years,  Amazon  has  converted  a  growing 
share  of  the  real  estate  on  its  search  results  pages  to 
sponsored  products,  while  reducing  the  space  devoted 

As  the  pressure  on  sellers  to  buy  advertising  has  grown, 
so  too  has  the  cost  of  the  ads.  Amazon  sets  its  ad  prices 
through a reverse auction, so small businesses have to bid 

9

Amazon’s Monopoly TollboothWWW.ILSR.ORGon  keywords  that  customers  enter  in  search.  Over  the  last 
year, the cost-per-click for sponsored ads increased by about 
15 percent on average.34 But the price of some keywords has 
skyrocketed. The cost of advertising on the results page for 
“laundry detergent liquid” rose 127 percent, for example.35 

expand its monopoly power and exploit it with finesse.
The policy solutions to Amazon’s exploitation of the retailers 
and  brands  trapped  by  its  gatekeeper  power  must  be 
twofold. 

By integrating across business lines, 
Amazon can perpetually expand its 
monopoly power and exploit it with finesse.

First,  its  marketplace  platform  should  be  subject  to  public 
utility-like standards of non-discrimination, fair dealing, and 
reasonable  pricing.  Congress  should  instruct  an  agency, 
such as the Federal Trade Commission, to establish rules for 
dominant digital platforms to ensure that Amazon provides 
fair and reasonable terms and pricing for sellers and cannot 
use  its  gatekeeper  power  to  privilege  favored  firms  or 
impose onerous costs on market participants.38 

Second, Amazon’s  various  divisions  must  be  spun  off  into 
separate  companies  to  eliminate  the  conflicts  of  interest 
and monopoly leveraging that their integration invites and  
entails.  Congress  should  adopt  a  policy  mandating  that 
dominant  digital  platforms  spin  off  their  other  divisions 
as  separate,  stand-alone  companies.  This  would  separate 
Amazon’s  various  components  —  its  online  marketplace, 
retail division, logistics operation, and so on — into separate 
companies.

Structural  separation  was  once  “a  standard  regulatory  tool 
and  key  antitrust  remedy  in  network  industries,”  applied 
in  industries  including  railroads,  bank  holding  companies, 
telecommunication  carriers.39 
television  networks,  and 
Today, the inherently anti-competitive dynamics of Amazon, 
including  its  ability  to  appropriate  revenue  and  data  from 
businesses that depend on its platform, and to manipulate 
platform  outcomes  to  entrench  its  market  power  and 
advantage its other lines of business, call for picking up this 
tool once again. 

Amazon also advertises its own private-label products, which 
reduces the space available for sponsored listings, helping 
to  drive  up  ad  prices  for  independent  sellers  and  brands. 
While  the  brands  and  sellers  that  compete  with  Amazon 
have  to  pay  for  sponsored  listings,  Amazon  allocates  this 
space to its private-label product division for free.36 It’s one 
more  way  that Amazon  uses  its  platform  to  cross-subsidize 
its Retail division. 

Amazon’s Nickels and Dimes: More Fees

While  these  are  the  primary  ways  Amazon  taxes  third 
party  sellers  that  rely  on  its  marketplace,  it’s  far  from  the 
only  way  Amazon  nickel-and-dimes  the  small  businesses  it 
claims  to  champion.  If,  for  example,  sellers  want  access  to 
an  account  manager  —  that  is,  they  want  to  be  able  to  talk 
with an Amazon employee when they need an answer to a  
question  or  help  navigating  the  byzantine  rules  of  the 
Marketplace  —  Amazon  charges  as  much  as  $5,000  per 
month.37 The fee amounts to a protection racket; sellers feel 
compelled to pay, as any glitch or a suspended account can 
have  ruinous  consequences  for  sellers  without  an  account 
manager  to  help.  As  one  seller  complained  in  Amazon’s 
forums, “It seems wrong that we should have to pay Amazon 
for this service, but there you go.” 

If  a  seller  wants Amazon  to  collect  sales  tax  for  it, Amazon 
will  –  and  it  will  take  another  percentage  cut  of  each  sale 
for  doing  so.  In  other  words,  sellers  are  made  to  pay  an 
Amazon tax on top of the actual tax. It’s a service that eBay, 
for example, provides for free, but Amazon’s dominance as 
a retail platform allows it to charge sellers whatever it likes. 

Conclusion: Policy Solutions

Amazon controls the underlying infrastructure for a large and 
growing share of our economy. Its dominance of e-commerce 
makes  it  a  gatekeeper  to  the  market  for  countless  online 
sellers.  This  extraordinary  position  allows  Amazon  to,  in 
effect, tax the transactions of businesses that depend on this 
infrastructure. Through its fees, Amazon extracts a growing 
share of its sellers’ revenue, fortifying its own dominance at 
their expense. At the same time, it leverages its control over 
sellers  to  gain  power  in  new,  adjacent  industries,  such  as 
fulfillment and advertising, without having to compete for it. 
By integrating across business lines, Amazon can perpetually

The Hon. David Cicilline 
Chairman, Antitrust Subcommittee 
U.S. House of Representatives 
2233 Rayburn House Office Building 
Washington, DC 20515 

Dear Chairman Cicilline,  

We write to thank you for your bipartisan leadership of the House Antitrust Subcommittee.  Your 
work has been critical to documenting the alarming dominance of a few tech platforms in the 
digital marketplace and the extraordinary leverage they wield over their competitors, suppliers, 
customers, the government, and the public.   As you succinctly observed at the Subcommittee’s 
July 29, 2020 hearing: “They have too much power.” 

Together, our organizations—the Association of American Publishers, the Authors Guild, and 
the American Booksellers Association—represent thousands of authors, publishers, and 
booksellers in the United States who serve the democratic exchange of ideas by creating, 
publishing, and selling books.  Our members rely upon a level playing field in the marketplace of 
ideas to reach, inform, and transact with customers for the delivery of books, whether in 
physical or digital form.  Regrettably, as the Subcommittee’s hearings have laid bare, the 
competitive framework of the publishing industry has been fundamentally altered in recent 
years—and remains at serious risk of further diminishment—because of the concentrated power 
and influence of one company in particular: Amazon.   

Amazon’s scale of operation and share of the market for book distribution has reached the point 
that no publisher can afford to be absent from its online store.  A year ago, the New York Times 
reported that Amazon controlled 50% of all book distribution, but for some industry suppliers, 
the actual figure may be much higher, with Amazon accounting for more than 70 or 80 percent 
of sales.  Whether it is the negative impact on booksellers of Amazon forcing publishers to 
predominantly use its platform, the hostile environment for booksellers on Amazon who see no 
choice but to sell there, or Amazon’s predatory pricing, the point is that Amazon’s concomitant 
market dominance allows it to engage in systematic below-cost pricing of books to squash 
competition in the book selling industry as a whole.  Remarkably, what this means is that even 
booksellers that avoid selling on Amazon cannot avoid suffering the consequences of Amazon’s 
market dominance.  The ongoing COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating the problem:  it continues to 
threaten the financial well-being of authors, publishers, and booksellers, some of whom will not 
survive the year.  Amazon, by contrast, with its ever-extensive operation and data network, has 
grown only more dominant, enjoying its largest-ever quarterly profits during April, May and June. 

As many antitrust experts have articulated, Amazon has aggressively exercised its market 
power against both suppliers and customers, and it possesses an unhealthy degree of control 
over the fate of other companies.  To be clear, this market power stems not only from Amazon’s 
share of the market for book distribution, but also from the astonishing level of data that it 
collects across its entire platform.  Amazon tracks and uses data that provides it with an

price point; what they have perused or considered purchasing; what video-games they are 
playing; and what television shows or movies they are watching.  The result is that Amazon no 
longer competes on a level playing field when it comes to book distribution, but, rather, owns 
and manipulates the playing field, leveraging practices from across its platform that appear to be 
well outside of fair and transparent competition. 

Members of the Subcommittee would surely agree that a robust, diverse, and competitive 
publishing industry is profoundly important to the United States.  Indeed, publishing is 
intertwined with the founding and Constitutional underpinnings of the Nation, and the publishing 
industry seeks to serve the interests and expectations of American readers who want a wide 
and unfiltered spectrum of books—from comprehensive political commentary to essential 
historical accounts to award-winning literature for both children and adults.  As Rohit Chopra 
said in his Remarks at the Silicon Flatirons Conference, University of Colorado Law School, on 
February 10, 2019: “We will never know what damage has already been done.  What books will 
never be written?  What ideas will never see the light of day?  Moving forward, we need to ask 
ourselves what these developments mean for our democratic values.  We need to make sure 
that technology is propelling our democracy, not holding it back.”    

As to the publishing industry, we believe that Amazon acts anti-competitively in multiple ways, 
dictating the economic terms of its relationships with suppliers so that publishers, their authors, 
and the booksellers who sell on Amazon pay more each year for Amazon’s distribution and 
advertising services but receive less each year in return.  Amazon employs non-transparent 
data algorithms and recommendation engines to steer consumers toward Amazon’s own 
products, or even toward infringing products without disclosing to consumers that it is doing so. 
It has required suppliers to agree to most-favored-nation provisions (MFNs) that stifle the 
emergence and growth of competitive alternatives in the book distribution marketplace.  And it 
manipulates suppliers and rivals by tying the purchase of distribution services to the purchase of 
its advertising services.   

As the Subcommittee continues to debate and decide the future rules of digital commerce, 
including more enforcement, modern regulation, and reform legislation, we respectfully highlight 
our concerns and recommendations for your consideration: 

1.  Prohibit Amazon from Leveraging Data from the Operation of its Online Platform to 
Compete with and Disadvantage the Suppliers Doing Business There: 
The authors, publishers, and booksellers that sell on Amazon’s platform are forced to do 
business in direct competition with Amazon’s myriad proprietary products but with very little 
insight into what Amazon is doing.  As discussed in a variety of submissions to government 
agencies and at agency hearings during the past year, Amazon employs opaque algorithms, 
search and discovery tools on its platform, and then uses the data it collects from its suppliers 
and platform customers to manipulate greater leverage and greater profits for its own interests.  
The data that Amazon collects from across its platform not only gives Amazon leverage over its 
book suppliers, it also gives Amazon an insurmountable lead over any would-be distribution 
rivals—a lead so daunting that, at this point, absent government intervention, there is no 
possibility of meaningful competition from anyone, whether they be publishers, booksellers, or 
emerging platforms.  Additionally, some of Amazon’s tools steer customers to sellers of 
infringing books, deceptive summaries, counterfeits, and other unauthorized copies that 
compete with legitimate sales.

2. Prohibit Amazon from Tying Distribution Services to the Purchase of Advertising 
Services:  Amazon offers two distinct services to the authors, publishers and booksellers that 
supply and sell books through its online bookstore, but brazenly ties them together so that 
suppliers must spend advertising dollars in order to make distribution services viable.  
Distribution services include helping customers find and purchase books on the Amazon 
platform, shipping, handling, and delivery of the books (physical and/or digital), customer 
service, and collection and remittance of proceeds, for which the operator of the platform 
receives compensation from its suppliers.  Advertising services, on the other hand, are designed 
to maximize the placement of advertisements to consumers at various points of the search and 
purchase experience—for example, through targeted or sponsored feeds.  Offered separately, 
both distribution and advertising are valuable services that authors, publishers, and booksellers 
will consider and decide to purchase under competitive market conditions.  But in instances 
where Amazon manipulates discovery tools to make a supplier’s books difficult to find without 
the purchase of advertising or refuses distribution unless the supplier also purchases 
advertising, Amazon can extract both unwanted purchases and supra-competitive prices from 
suppliers.  It also disadvantages rivals by directing valuable advertising dollars to its own 
dominant business.  We believe such tactics are anticompetitive because they allow Amazon to 
control its suppliers and prevent the emergence and growth of would-be rivals.   

3. Prohibit Amazon from Imposing MFNs and Other Parity Provisions: While MFNs and 
parity provisions are not inherently anti-competitive, Amazon’s use of such provisions against 
publishers has been, and it has had a direct impact on authors, booksellers, and other 
competitors.  For example, through MFNs, Amazon has required publishers to a) offer Amazon 
similar or better economic terms and conditions as those offered to any competing distributors; 
b) inform Amazon about more favorable or alternative terms given to competitors; and c) restrict 
pricing discounts to consumers.  To provide some additional context, we note that Amazon has 
imposed conditions that affect wholesale and agency prices, sales commissions, discount and 
credit terms, the availability of books, book features, alternative distribution models, and 
promotional offerings.  Because of Amazon’s market power, these contractual requirements 
have the effect of preventing rival distributors, including new entrants, from bargaining with 
suppliers for lower prices, different business models, promotional advantages, or even from 
offering customers lower prices on their own.  Lawmakers should be concerned that Amazon 
imposes MFNs and other parity provisions to eliminate the ability of rivals or new entrants to 
gain any meaningful competitive advantage relative to Amazon, and extremely wary of 
permitting Amazon to regulate itself as to whether, when, and against whom it will impose or 
enforce such provisions.  

4. Prohibit Amazon from Using Loss-Leader Pricing to Harm Competition: For over two 
decades, Amazon has used books as loss leaders in the book industry to lure consumers to its 
website, gather data, make profits on bigger ticket items, and capture an increasing market 
share.  Despite innovation in the independent bookselling world, independent bookstores find 
themselves struggling to compete with a company that historically sells books at a loss to that 
end.  Amazon has garnered the bulk of the online book market through loss leader pricing, 
including by offering books below cost in order to promote and sell its proprietary Kindle device.  
Importantly, Amazon’s use of pricing tactics in the book industry reveals that one of its core 
business strategies is one used by monopolies for over a century – underselling the competition 
to monopolize markets.  Amazon is now using similar pricing tactics to harm competitors in 
other markets, such as the third-party platform market.

Shaoul Sussman of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance reports that Amazon is the largest 
negative cash flow firm in the world, and that these types of companies “can achieve greater 
market share” through this type of pricing strategy, which involve “long-term, below-average 
variable cost prices.” Sussman stresses that the negative impact of this behavior is the 
elimination of present and future competition.  This has certainly been the case in the 
bookselling world, where Amazon’s strategy has been indirectly or directly responsible for the 
closure of countless bookstores.   As it employs this pricing strategy in other markets, we are 
seeing the same impact on business sectors ranging from hardware stores to malls.   

The Subcommittee’s work has shown that Amazon holds an outsized position of power and 
control in our country, giving it the ability to interfere with the free flow of information, ideas and 
literature on a large scale.  With great appreciation for your leadership, we note that the 
American book publishing industry is and always has been uniquely intertwined with our 
democracy.  Many authors, publishers, and booksellers along the way have contributed to the 
marketplace of ideas, and we hope that many more will emerge and thrive to the benefit of the 
public.  This will not happen, however, unless government officials step in decisively to exercise 
appropriate governance of Amazon. 

In closing, we note the words of House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler during the 
Subcommittee’s July 29, 2020 hearing, invoking Thomas Jefferson and Louis Brandeis:  The 
“concentration of economic or political power is dangerous to a democratic society.”
