Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

Introduction 

Objectives of the public consultation 

The proposal for a New Competition Tool is one of the measures aimed at making 
sure that competition policy and rules are fit for the modern economy. It is meant 
to address gaps in the current EU competition rules, which have been identified 
based on the Commission’s enforcement experience in digital and other markets, 
as  well as  the  worldwide  reflection process about  the  need  for changes  to  the 
current competition law framework to allow for enforcement action preserving the 
competitiveness of markets. 

EU competition law can address (i) anti-competitive agreements and concerted 
practices  between  companies  pursuant  to  Article  101  of  the  Treaty  on  the 
Functioning  of  the  European  Union  ('‘the  EU  Treaty'‘)  and  (ii)  the  abuse  by  a 
company of its dominant position pursuant to Article 102 of the EU Treaty. The 
enforcement experience of the Commission and national competition authorities, 
as  well  as  the  worldwide  reflection  process  on  the  fitness  of  the  existing 
competition  rules  to  tackle  today’s  challenges  have  helped  to  identify  certain 
structural  competition  problems 
(e.g. 
that 
monopolisation  strategies  by  non-dominant  companies  with  market  power)  or 
cannot address in the most effective manner (e.g. strategies by companies with 
market  power  to  extend  their  market  position  into  multiple  related  markets).

The objective of this consultation is to collect stakeholder views on two aspects. 
First, stakeholders are asked to provide their views on whether there is a need 
for a new competition tool to ensure fair and competitive markets with a view to 
delivering lower prices and higher quality, as well as more choice and innovation 
to European consumers. Second, stakeholders are asked to provide their views 
on the characteristics that such a new competition tool should have in order to 
address  structural  competition  problems  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner. 

In  parallel,  the  Commission  is  also  engaged  in  a  process  of  exploring,  in  the 
context of the Digital Services Act package, ex ante rules to ensure that markets 
characterised  by  large  platforms  with  significant  network  effects  acting  as 
gatekeepers,  remain  fair  and  contestable  for  innovators,  businesses,  and  new 
market  entrants.  As  part  of  that  process,  the  Commission  has  launched  a 
consultation to seek views on the framing, on the scope, the specific perceived 
problems, and the implications, definition and parameters for addressing possible 
issues deriving from the economic power of large, digital gatekeeper platforms. 
As such, the work on a proposed New Competition Tool and on the ex ante rules 
complement  each  other.  The  work  on  the  two  impact  assessments  will  be 
conducted in parallel in order to ensure a coherent outcome. In this context, the 
Commission  will  take  into  consideration  the  feedback  received  from  both 
consultations. We would therefore invite you, in preparing your responses to the

     C. Structural competition problems 

Structural  competition  problems  concern  structural  market  characteristics  that 
have  adverse  consequences  on  competition  and  may  ultimately  result  in 
inefficient market outcomes in terms of higher prices, lower quality, less choice 
and  innovation.  These  market  characteristics  (explained  in  more  detail  below) 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 8 - 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

include  extreme  economies  of  scale  and  scope,  strong  network  effects,  zero 
pricing and data dependency, as well as market dynamics favouring sudden and 
radical  decreases  in  competition  (‘tipping’)  and  ‘winner-takes-most’  scenarios. 
These characteristics can typically be found in digital but also in other markets. 

As the Commission has established in some of its competition decisions, these 
characteristics  can  make  a  position  of  market  power  or  dominance,  once 
acquired, difficult to contest. 

While  structural  competition  problems  can  arise  in  a  broad  range  of  different 
scenarios,  they  can  be  generally  grouped  into  two  categories  depending  on 
whether  harm  is  about  to  affect  or  has  already  affected  the  market: 

•  Structural risks for competition refer to scenarios where certain market 
characteristics (e.g. network and scale effects, lack of multi-homing and 
lock-in effects) and the conduct of the companies operating in the markets 
concerned create a threat for competition, arising through the creation of 
powerful market players with an entrenched market position. This applies 
notably  to  tipping  markets.  The  ensuing  risks  for  competition  can  arise 
through the creation of powerful market players with an entrenched market 
and/or gatekeeper position, the emergence of which could be prevented 
by early intervention. Other scenarios falling under this category include 
unilateral strategies by non-dominant companies to monopolise a market 
through anti-competitive means. 

•  Structural lack of competition refers to a scenario where a market is not 
working well and not delivering competitive outcomes due to its structure 
(i.e.  structural  market  failures).  These  include  (i)  markets  displaying 
systemic failures going beyond the conduct of a particular company due to 
certain structural features, such as high concentration and entry barriers, 
customer  lock-in,  lack  of  access  to  data  or  data  accumulation,  and  (ii) 
oligopolistic  market  structures  characterised  by  a  risk  for  tacit  collusion, 
including  markets  featuring  increased  transparency  due  to  algorithm-
based technological solutions.  

The  questions  in  this section aim to  gather information  on  the  types  of market 
characteristics that may result in structural competition problems, and on gaps in 
Articles  101  and  102  of  the  EU  Treaty,  in  order  to  understand  the  most 
appropriate  scope  for  a  new  competition  tool.  (Article  101  of  the  EU  Treaty 
prohibits  agreements  between  companies  which  prevent,  restrict  or  distort 
competition in the EU and which may affect trade between Member States (‘anti-
competitive  agreements’).  These  include,  for  example,  price-fixing  or  market-

sharing  cartels.  Article  102  of  the  Treaty  prohibits  any  abuse  by  one  or  more 
undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial 
part of it.) 

6.  Please  indicate  to  what  extent  each  of  the  following  market  features 
/elements can be a source or part of the reasons for a structural competition 
problem  in  a  given  market  in  your  view.  Please,  give  examples  of 
sectors/markets or scenarios you are aware of in the follow-up question. 

Competition  law  has  ample  experience  regarding  all  of  the  market  features 
identified by the Commission in Q6. There is ample case law, decisional practice 
and research confirming that features such as high fixed costs (C, D), financial 
strength (O) regulatory barriers (E), IPRs (F), switching costs (H) and access to 
indispensable assets may constitute barriers to entry (I). Experience also shows 
that  one  cannot  necessarily  draw  a  direct  connection  between  market 
concentration (A) and insufficient competition. Similarly, the fact that consumers 
may predominantly single-home (M) may in some cases be plausibly explained 
by  the  superior quality  of  a  given  service. What  matters is whether  users face 
technical or economic barriers to switching. 

There are other features, like vertical integration (B), zero-pricing (P), economies 
of scale and scope (J), network effects (K, L) and dual-role situations (N) that are 
more ambiguous from a competitive standpoint. These can be a source of market 
power as well as a source of value and efficiencies, often at the same time. Mere 
access  to  data  is  most  often  not  determinative  (only  in  few  occasions,  for 
instance, when pooling agreements exist -for instance, statistical data on losses 
for insurance purposes and new entrants should be allowed to join and access 
that common data for calculating the loss premium); competition is more driven 
by skill, foresight and industry in deciding what data to collect, how to collect it 
and  how  to  process  them  in  a  way that  adds  value  and may  be monetized.  In 
sum, the relevance of the features identified in Q6 needs to be assessed on a 
case-by-case basis.  

In  conclusion,  it  is  not  possible  to  hold  general  sweeping  assumptions  about 
these  features  being  generally  positive  or  negative.  On  the  contrary,  the 
anticompetitive  or  pro-competitive  nature  of  these  features  seems  to  largely 
depend  on  whether  there  is  a  bottleneck  (an  unavoidable  or  at  least  very 
important  point  of  entry  to  an  assemble  of  related  markets),  and  there  are 
significant and permanent barriers to entry and expansion in the bottleneck. This, 
in  turn,  varies  decisively  depending  on  the  legal  and  economic  context 
(regulation, business model, etc.). 

Example: In Microsoft/Skype the Commission dismissed competition concerns in 
a concentrated market, characterized by economies of scale and scope, strong

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

network  effects,  vertical  integration,  zero-pricing  and  self-preferencing  by  a 
dominant platform with shares of 90% in all relevant markets under consideration. 
Both  the  General  Court’s  Judgment  in  Cisco  and  the  recent  evolution  of  the 
market for video calls on Windows PCs have confirmed that the Commission’s 
competitive  assessment  was  correct.  That  assessment  would  appear  to  be  at 
odds with some of the assumptions underlying the concerns in Q6. 

Furthermore,  those  market  features  are  also  present  in  non-digital  markets.  In 
fact, many of them are mentioned in the Commission’s Guidance on exclusionary 
conducts,  published  in  2009,  which  were  drafted  having  mostly  the  traditional 
sectors in mind. 

6.1  Can  you  think  of  any  other  market  features/elements  that  could  be  a 
source or part of the reasons for a structural competition problem in a given 
market? 

The existence of significant and permanent barriers to entry and expansion in the 
bottleneck, which in its highest degree generates customer lock-in and, hence, 
an  ecosystem.  The  presence  of  an  ecosystem,  which  clearly  has  advantages 
from a consumer perspective, but depending on the technical components of the 
ecosystem and interoperability mechanisms in place, can also increase switching 
cost for the different components of the ecosystem. 

In  non-digital  markets,  the  EU  sectorial  enquiries  have  shown  some  market 
features  that  could  be  a  source  of  structural  competition  problem.  As  a  mere 
example,  in  the  insurance/reinsurance  sector  the  reiteration  between  same 
players  in  ad-hoc  insurance/reinsurance  schemes,  that  favour  alignment  of 
conditions and may lead to lower competition just focussed on commissions for 
reinsurance.  The  UK  market  investigations  have  also  shown  some  structural 
problems in many other markets (usually oligopolistic but with additional elements 
as well1). As a mere example, in the aggregates case part of the source of the 
problem was dual role of suppliers/clients between competitors as these relations 
increased price transparency and could favour price alignment not caught by art.

6.2 Please indicate which are these other market features/elements that can 
be a source or part of the reasons for a structural competition problem in a 
given market and rate them according to their importance from 0 to 4 (0 = 
no  knowledge/no  experience;  1  =  no  importance/no  relevance;  2  = 
somewhat important; 3 = important; 4 = very important).

N/A 

7  Please  indicate  what  market  scenarios  may  in  your  view  qualify  as 
structural  competition  problems  and  rate  them  according  to  their 
importance. 

“Somewhat important” (all scenarios) 

7.1 Please explain your answers above and give examples if possible. 

All  of  the  market  scenarios  described  in  Q7  may  or  may  not  give  rise  to 
competition concerns. Problems should not be ruled out, but they should not be 
taken for granted either. The formulation of the questions in Q7 appears to make 
some  assumptions  that  do  not  necessarily  follow  from  the  market  situation 
described.  For instance,  highly concentrated  markets or the use  of  algorithmic 
pricing  do  not  necessarily  allow  undertakings  to  align  their  market  behaviour. 
Similarly, the fact that a company may reach a critical mass of users in a market 
subject  to  network  effects  does  not  necessarily  confer  a  “disproportionate 
advantage”.  Absent  barriers  to  switching,  even  companies  with  high  markets 
share will need to innovate and be disciplined by actual or potential competition. 
The problems identified in Q7 cannot, however, be ruled out in all scenarios. We 
support  vigorous  competition  enforcement  to  identify  and  address  those 
problems  should  they  arise  but  without  taking  any  aprioristic  position  in  any 
specific sector (for instance, digital) or in any specific market scenario.

competition problems? 

No.

qualify as structural competition problems and rate them according to their 
importance from 0 to 4 (0 = no knowledge/no experience; 1 = no importance

8  Structural  competition  problems  may  arise  in  markets  where  a  (not 
necessarily dominant) company with market power in a core market may 
apply repeated strategies to extend its market position to related markets, 
for instance, by relying on large amounts of data. 

8.1. Do you have knowledge or did you come across such market situation? 

Yes. 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 12 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

8.2  In  which  sectors/markets  did  you  experience  repeated  strategies  to 
extend market power to related markets? 

It is very common for companies (dominant or not) to try to extend their position 
from one market to other related markets. This happens in all kinds of markets 
and  sectors  of  the  economy  (not  only  in  digital  sectors)  and  it  is  most  often 
procompetitive (for instance, incumbent operators or simply strong operators in 
one energy market - electricity- extend its activities to the gas sector or viceversa, 
in  the  telecoms  &  media  sector  -fix  telephony,  afterwards,  mobile  telephony, 
further internet, then media content, etc.; all in all: same companies using their 
client  portfolio  to  enlarge  the  range  of  products  offered  and  that  are  usually 
acquired by those same clients).  

Strategies to operate in related markets are also inherent to platform business 
models,  which  consist  of  connecting  different  but  interdependent  set  of  users, 
fostering complementarities and creating value across multi-sided settings. Every 
company  can,  and  should  be  encouraged  to,  legitimately  make  use  of  its 
competitive advantages to enter and compete in other markets to the extent that 
its conduct does not foreclose competitors in an anticompetitive way. Competition 
law and economics generally view vertical integration as a source of efficiencies 
(e.g. the Commission’s Guidelines on non-horizontal mergers). In some cases, 
dominant companies may seek to extend their market power via different means 
of  anticompetitive  leveraging.  There  is  established  case  law  and  experience 
regarding  the  circumstances  in  which  those strategies may  be anticompetitive. 
Competition authorities have a proven track-record of flexibility and success in 
addressing this kind of strategies. 

8.3 Please list and explain instances where a company with market power 
has used its position to try to enter adjacent/neighboring markets to expand 
its market power. 

Many companies with or without market power in all sectors of the economy often 
try  to  enter  adjacent/neighbouring  markets.  The  case  law  offers  examples  of 
instances  of  such  strategies,  and  offers  guidance  as  to  their  legality  (e.g. 
Microsoft, Commercial Solvents, Tetra Pak, Telemarketing, Deutsche Telekom, 
Wanadoo, etc.). Even in  less  sophisticated markets,  that do not  seem  to  pose 
competition concerns so far, such as supermarkets, it is very frequent to see that 
retailers become “manufacturers” of their own products and compete with their 
suppliers of branded products. See also some examples provided above in the 
telecom & media sector. 

8.4.  Do  you  consider  that  strategies  to  extend  market  power  to  related 
markets are common in digital sectors/markets? 

Yes, to some extent; but also in non-digital sectors/markets.

8.5 Please explain your answer and identify the sectors/markets concerned. 

As explained in the response to 8.2, strategies to operate in related markets are 
also inherent to platform business models, which consist of connecting different 
but interdependent set of users, fostering complementarities and creating value 
across multi-sided settings. In addition, the narrow market definitions adopted in 
many digital markets may facilitate the definition of a variety of closely connected 
markets which, in turn, might facilitate the identification of “leveraging”. Providing 
complementary  services  across  markets  is  one  of  the  ways  in  which  digital 
companies and ecosystems may compete and create value for users. Whether 
these strategies are ultimately pro- or anti-competitive needs to be assessed in 
light  of  the  relevant  economic  and  legal  context  to  every  strategy  and  market. 
Making wrong assumptions either way can be costly for society.  

Moreover within the context of a possible NCT which is does not seem to subject 
to the limits and procedural safeguards of articles 101 and 102 TFEU, making 
wrong assumptions may reduce certainty and attractiveness for investors in the 
EU in digital markets (which is precisely one of the areas in which the EU has a 
competitive disadvantage). 

8.6 In your experience, does a repeated strategy by a company with market 
power  to  extend  its  market  power  to  related  markets  raise  competition 
concerns? 

The  question  is  unclear.  In  view  of  the  respondents,  the  Commission  should 
provide a clear definition of what is meant by the notion of “market power” as it 
seems  to  set  a  new  threshold  for  intervention  different  from  that  of  “dominant 
position”  set  out  in  Article  102  TFEU.  The  same  applies  to  the  expression  of 
“extension of market power”, which in itself is vague and imprecise. Moreover, 
respondents  also  find  questionable that  the  concerns  the  NCT should address 
only relate to a “repeated strategy”, excluding one-time strategies from dominant 
companies/companies with market power aimed at extending such power in their 
own or other markets.  

8.7. Please explain your answer, and indicate the competition concerns that 
may arise in case of leveraging strategies. 

Leveraging strategies will be procompetitive when based on competition on the 
merits as well as in situations where the entry of a new company/business model 
in the adjacent market may translate into greater competition. 

Ample  experience  in  law  and  economics  has  shown  that  leveraging  strategies 
may  give  rise  to  competition  concerns  when  three  conditions  are  met:  (i) 
undertaken  by  dominant  companies  in  markets  with  high  barriers  to  entry  and 
where  the  dominant  company  has  a  competitive  advantage  not  accessible  to

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

others;  (ii)  not  based  on  competition  on  the  merits,  and  (ii)  likely  to  lead  to 
anticompetitive  foreclosure  of  rivals  who  could  become  as-efficient  as  the 
dominant firm.  

Respondents  understand  that  the  intervention  of  the  Commission  should  be 
based  on  the  established  threshold  of  dominance  rather  than  on  a  new, 
apparently  lower  but  in  any  case  undefined  threshold  of  “market  power”  that 
creates legal and economic uncertainty.  

9.  Do  you  think  that  there  is  a  need  for  the  Commission  to  be  able  to 
intervene  in  situations  where  structural  competition  problems  may  arise 
due to repeated strategies by companies with market power to extend their 
market position into related markets? 

See response to question 8.6 above.   

9.1. Please explain your answer. If you replied yes, please also indicate the 
type of intervention that would be needed. 

The  European  Commission  and  every  other  competition  authority  and  court 
should  be  able  to  intervene  in  the  face  of  risks  of  anticompetitive  leveraging. 
Experience shows that competition authorities currently enjoy the powers to do 
so under the coverage of articles 101 & 102 TFEU and through additional tools 
(merger  control,  sectorial  enquiries,  commitment  decisions  under  aticle  9  of 
Regulation 1/2003). 

9.2. Do you consider that Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are suitable 
and sufficiently effective to address those market situations? 

Yes. 

9.3. Please explain your answer 

There is a great wealth of experience concerning the successful application of 
competition  law  to  anticompetitive  leveraging  strategies  articulated  around 
different  business  methods,  including  tying/bundling,  exclusivity,  predatory 
pricing, margin squeeze and even product design, among others.  

EU and national courts have developed flexible standards based on “imprecise 
legal  concepts”  (see  Case  T-167/08,  Microsoft,  para.  91)  that  have  been 
replicated around the world and that enable authorities to intervene in the face of 
risks  that  a  conduct  may  be  “capable”  of  “potentially”  restricting  competition. 
Under  these  provisions,  the  Commission  also  has  the  powers  to  impose 
behavioural or structural remedies. Under Art. 9 of Regulation 1/2003, moreover, 
the  Commission  enjoys  the  power  to  make  binding  behavioural  or  structural 
commitments, even when disproportionate to the competition concerns at issue.

Even a cooperation mechanism in exchange for a fine reduction has been applied 
beyond  cartel  settlement  procedures  to  vertical  restraints  (see,  for  instance, 
Cases  AT.  40465  Asus,  AT.  40469  Denon  &  Marantz,  AT.  40181  Philips,  and 
AT.40182 Pioneer) and abuse (see, for instance, Case 39759 ARA foreclosure). 

Whereas  Arts.  101  and  102  do  not  cover  purely  “unilateral”  conduct  by  non-
dominant firms, it is not easy to anticipate scenarios where such conduct may be 
capable of foreclosing as-efficient competitors. 

The experience gained across thousands of cases in virtually all sectors is also 
extremely helpful to understand the circumstances in which Articles 101 and 102 
should not intervene. Lack of enforcement in certain situations is not necessarily 
explained  by  the  insufficiency  of  the  tools,  but  because  of  the  existence  of 
important reasons not to deploy them.  

For all of their flexibility and adaptability, Articles 101 and 102 (like any other rule 
of  law)  should  not  be  deployed  to  pursue  desired  outcomes  on  the  basis  of 
“fairness” ideals.  

Deterrence. Some members take the view that the system of remedies (based 
eminently  on  fines)  may  not  always  have  been  historically  sufficient  to  deter 
repeat offenders. There is, however, a view that the increase in damages actions, 
the  increase  in  the  level  of  fines  and  greater  reputational  damage  may  now 
reduce this perceived shortcoming.  

Remedies. Some members have also pointed out that remedies should be better 
designed.  If the  Commission’s objective  is to  regulate  markets and  create and 
administer intrusive remedies along the lines of ex ante access obligations, then 
there is ample consensus that competition law would not be well-suited and ex-
ante legislation (with clear cut obligations and prohibitions ensuring predictability) 
should be adopted. The experience of the UK market investigations regime in, for 
example,  retail  banking,  shows  that  remedies  can  eliminate  obstacles  to 
competition (e.g. by facilitating switching and interoperability) without intruding on 
complex  business  models  or  market  structures.  However,  also  like  in  the  UK, 
strong safeguards and balances should be adopted within the context of these 
procedures (hearings, public reports, consultations, etc.). 

Duration  of  investigations.  Whereas  the  length  of  enforcement  proceedings 
might also be a problem in some cases (also in non-digital scenarios), this is a 
risk that may have been somewhat overstated (there are no clear examples of 
cases  where  swifter  enforcement  would  have  had  brought  about  meaningful 
change)  and  that  could  be  addressed  via  the  welcome  re-use  of  interim 
measures. There is ample consensus among our members that justifying a new 
competition  tool  on  the  basis  of  this observation  could  lead  to  an  overlap  with 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 16 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

Articles 101 and 102 that could be difficult to manage and would raise significant 
legal concerns. 

Perceived  shortcomings  should  be  addressed  with  greater  resources. 
There  is a  consensus that  concerns about the  sufficiency and  effectiveness  of 
Articles 101 and 102 would be best addressed by granting significant additional 
resources  to  competition  authorities and making  more  proactive  use  of  interim 
measures when need be. 

Other suggestions: 

   The  creation  of  informal  forums  where  companies  and  competition 
authorities  could  exchange 
regarding 
contemplated  or  current  business  practices  could  also  avoid  certain 
problems  while  resulting  in  somewhat  greater  legal  certainty.  A  more 
proactive  use  of  sectorial  enquiries  and  general  recommendations,  as 
well as commitment decisions could be better suited to address structural 
problems.  

information  and 

feedback 

If the Commission finally decides to opt for a new competition tool (which 
is an option the respondents do not support), we propose that this tool is 
limited to clearly identified competition concerns in each case (regardless 
of  the  specific  economic  sector;  i.e.,  no  “digital  only”)  and  is  limited  to 
permanent  market  structure  problems.  If  the  concerns  mainly  refer  to 
behavioural aspects, they should be treated under arts. 101 & 102 TFEU, 
which ensure a deeper analysis on a case-by-case basis and with all the 
procedural,  legal  and  economic  guarantees  that  the  new  tool  does  not 
seem to envisage at this stage. 

10. Anti-competitive monopolisation refers to scenarios where one market 
player  may  rapidly  acquire  market  shares  due  to  its  capacity  to  put 
competitors  at  a  disadvantage  in  the  market  unfairly,  for  instance,  by 
imposing  unfair  business  practices  or  by  limiting  access  to  key  inputs, 
such as data. 

10.1.  Do  you  have  knowledge  or  did  you  come  across  such  market 
situation? 

Yes, but not only in digital and not only data related. 

10.2.  In  which  sectors/markets  did  you  experience  anti-competitive 
monopolisation strategies? 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 17 - 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

Anticompetitive  monopolisation  can  occur  in  traditional  markets  where  an 
aspiring  monopolist  prevents  competitors’  products  from  reaching  consumers. 
For example, this could occur in the consumer products’ sector when misusing a 
category  manager  position  at  the  retail  level  (see  paras.  209-213  of  the 
Commission’s  Guidelines  on  vertical  agreements).  Also  in  services  related 
markets  (for  instance  in  Spain,  using  clients  data  bases  created  for  supply  of 
energy under a non-liberalised regime to render additional installing services and 
refusing access to that data to competing installers: a case duly addressed under 
traditional dominance /article 102 TFEU provisions without the need of additional 
tools). 

It has also occurred (and could occur) in dynamic technology markets and new-
economy markets, such as the computer hardware or communication industries, 
concerning malpractices in the standard setting processes. On these occasions, 
the EC has been able to tackle the problem through articles 101 and 102 TFEU.  

Unilateral  anticompetitive  conducts  could  also,  to  some  extent,  occur  across 
digital  markets,  where  IP  rights  play  a  relevant  role  and  there  are  important 
network  effects.  For  example,  practices  designed  to  exclude  competitors  in 
tipping  markets:  a  platform  refusing  to  list  a  product  on  its  platform  which 
competes with the platform’s own product, providing preferential treatment to its 
own products vis a vis that of rivals or reducing the attractiveness or functionality 
of rival products. For tipping markets, please see answers to Q16 below.  

10.3. Please provide examples and explain them. 

See answer to Q 10.2 above. 

10.4. Do you consider that anti-competitive monopolisation is common in 
digital sectors/markets? 

Yes, to some extent but not necessarily more than in other sectors. 

10.5.  Please  explain  your  answer  and  identify  the  sectors/markets 
concerned. 

See answer to Q 10.2 above. 

10.6.  In  your  experience,  does  anti-competitive  monopolisation  raise 
competition concerns? 

As a matter of law, any anti-competitive action raises competition concerns, and 
so does anti-competitive monopolisation.

that may arise in case of anticompetitive monopolisation.

Companies are legally permitted, and encouraged, to try to acquire market power. 
The prospect, or the desire for, substantial market power stimulates competition 
and innovation, and monopolies can be, on occasions, more efficient than other 
smaller competitors.  

Traditionally, some unilateral practices can raise significant competition concerns 
when  exerted  by  dominant  undertakings  (i.e.  exclusionary  conduct  and 
exploitative abuses), and other conduct exists that can be harmful irrespective of 
market power (such as regulatory gaming).    

Certain  conduct  when  exerted  by  undertakings  with  the  aim  of  monopolizing 
could, on some occasions, raise competition concerns. This would particularly be 
the case if it leads to a monopolisation of the market. Some examples  of these 
conducts would be:  

-  Fraudulent  patent  infringement  suits  (i.e.  gaming  the  regulatory  regime 

controlling the approval of generic drugs). 

-  Abuse of standard-setting processes. 
-  Tortuous  conduct,  including  fraud  or  misrepresentation  towards  other 

market participants or consumers.  

-  Acquisition  of  market  power  in  tipping  markets  through  anticompetitive 

conduct.  

-  Unilateral  anticompetitive  acquisitions  (i.e.  acquisition  of  potential 

disruptor).  

11.  Do  you  think  that  there  is  a  need  for  the  Commission  to  be  able  to 
intervene  in  situations  where  structural  competition  problems  may  arise 
due to anti-competitive monopolisation? 

No,  unless  a  breach of  competition  law  is demonstrated under arts 101 & 102 
TFEU or under the merger regulation test. Otherwise, the careful balance stricken 
between the principles of an open and free economy, legal certainty and the limits 
imposed to dominant players whenever they abuse of their market power would 
be jeopardised.  

11.1.  Please explain your answer.  If you replied yes,  please  also indicate 
the type of intervention that would be needed. 

Conduct can have ambiguous competitive effects. Unilateral conduct may or may 
not lead to an increase in market power or to a monopoly.  

Unilateral  conduct  regimes  could  alter  efficient  markets  and  their  competitive 
processes. Market forces alone may generate efficient results and government

intervention  can  become  counterproductive.  Moreover,  market  power  in  new-
economy  and  high-tech  markets  can  quickly  vary  over  time  and,  thus,  early 
intervention  in  this  context  could  try  to  address  questions  that  would  be 
readdressed naturally by competition dynamics in the short-medium term.   

In addition, establishing a threshold concerning market power can lead to a lot of 
false positives, which in rapidly growing models risk stifling promising business 
models.  Intervention  to  address  anticompetitive  monopolisation  would  only  be 
justified 
to  monopolize 
anticompetitively and if the predatory or anticompetitive conduct will most likely 
or almost certainly lead to achieving monopoly power. This would be very difficult 
to determine in advance.  

is  robust  evidence  of  a  clear 

intent 

there 

if 

On  the  other  hand,  it  is  unclear  which  type  of  conduct  would  qualify  as 
“anticompetitive”.  

Finally, apart from article 102 TFEU (see below), national unfair competition rules 
could tackle some of these unilateral behaviours. For instance, behaviours that 
entail a breach of other regulations (patent, privacy, consumer protection laws, 
etc.)  and  which  precisely  due  to  that  breach  the  company  gains  a  competitive 
advantage, is a typical act covered by unfair competition laws. The same happens 
with situations of abuse of “relative” situation of dependency (not an “absolute” 
situation  of  dominance  in  the  market,  but  specific  market  power  vis  -à-  vis  a 
supplier or a client). Transforming potential infringements of regulatory regimes 
by  dominant  firms  or  firms  with  market  power  that  give  them  a  competitive 
advantage in situations quasi equivalent to breaches of article 102 TFEU would 
not probably pass the EU Courts’ tests. Much less would it be appropriate to use 
such a dilutive concept to implement a new tool that does not meet the procedural 
standards and safeguards of article 102 TFEU. 

11.2. Do you consider that Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are suitable 
and sufficiently effective to address anti-competitive monopolisation? 

Yes. 

11.3. Please explain your answer. 

Article  102  TFEU  is  enough  to  address  anticompetitive  conduct  once  its 
perpetrator has reached dominance or near-monopoly.  

In addition, article 102 TFEU has traditionally adapted to prevent anticompetitive 
unilateral  conduct.  In  this  respect,  the  EC  has  confronted  anticompetitive 
monopolisation in the past by either imposing liability on the unilateral conduct of 
the dominant firms even for conduct outside the market which they dominate or 
by narrowly defining relevant markets.

12.  An  oligopoly  is  a  highly  concentrated  market  structure,  where  a  few 
sizeable  firms  operate.  Oligopolists  may  be  able  to  behave  in  a  parallel 
manner  and  derive  benefits  from  their  collective  market  power  without 
necessarily  entering  into  an  agreement  or  concerted  practice  of  the  kind 
generally  prohibited  by  competition  law.  In  those  situations,  rivals  often 
‘move together’ to e.g. raise prices or limit production at the same time and 
to the same extent, without having an explicit agreement. Such so-called 
coordinated  behaviour  can  have  the  same  outcome  as  a  cartel  for 
customers, e.g. price increases are aligned. 

12.1.  Do  you  have  knowledge  or  did  you  come  across  such  market 
situations? 

Yes. 

12.2. Please identify the markets concerned and explain those market 
situations. 

An  oligopoly  is  a  highly  concentrated  market  where  a  few  firms  operate.  An 
oligopolistic market structure should not be, as such, a cause of concern. Under 
certain conditions players may coordinate their behaviour without an agreement, 
under other circumstances they may compete. 

Parallel behaviour in some markets may be the rational response to competitors’ 
actions.  

The level of concentration is not per se a sign of collusion, other elements such 
as the symmetry of the market shares, the transparency of the prices, and the 
existence of facilitating practices are additional elements that are often necessary 
for collusion. 

Not all markets compete on prices some may have other dynamics and they may 
compete e.g. in volume of products sold, quality or innovation. It is important to 
understand the competitive parameters, incentives and dynamics present in each 
of the markets. 

Markets  such  as  telecoms,  cement/aggregates,  tobacco,  TV  advertising  or 
breweries,  energy,  pharma/biomedical  devices  in  some  markets,  etc.  can  be 
highly concentrated. 

In some of them you may observe that competition is enhanced by competitive 
constrains  coming  from  neighbouring  markets  e.g.  Digital  advertisement  to  TV 
advertisement  or  mobile  phones  to  fixed  phones;  in  pharma  markets  potential 
competition from other innovative products or adaptations is essential.

Again,  the  narrow  definition  of  markets  often  ignores  the  competitive  pressure 
coming from other markets that have a significant impact on the business plans. 

12.3.  In  your  experience,  what  are  the  main  features  of  an  oligopolistic 
market with a high/substantial risk of tacit collusion? 

•  High concentration levels. Somewhat important. 

•  Competitors can monitor each other's behaviour. Important. 

•  Oligopolists  competing  against  each  other  in  several  markets  No 

relevance. 

. 

•  Homogeneity of products. Important. 

•  High  barriers  to  enter  (e.g.,  access  to  intellectual  property  rights,  high 
incumbency 

footprint,  strong 

marketing  costs,  global  distribution 
advantages, network effects...). Important. 

•  Strong incumbency advantages due to customers' switching costs and/or 

inertia. No relevance. 

•  Lack of transparency for customers on best offers available in the markets. 

No relevance. 

•  Vertical  integration  into  key  assets  of  the  vertical  supply  chain.  No 
relevance  unless  members  of  the  oligopoly  are  at  the  same  time 
suppliers & clients between themselves in vertically related markets. 

Please explain your answer and your rating above. 

In  our  opinion  the  conditions  that  may  impact  the  risk  of  tacit  collusion  in  an 
oligopolistic market are the existence of high barriers to entry and the possibility 
to monitor your competitor’s behaviour; when the products are homogenous the 
possibility to monitor your competitor’s’ behaviour is enhanced. 

High  concentration  levels  might  be  somewhat  important  depending  on  other 
market features, such as the competitive pressure exercised by potential entrants 
or from neighbour markets.  

Strong incumbency advantages due to customers’ switching costs and or inertia 
are  not  relevant  as  such  since  they  are  to  be  considered  barriers  to  entry  or 
barriers to potential competitive pressure. The lack of transparency for customers 
on best offers available in the markets should be regarded as a switching cost

and therefore as a barrier to competitive pressure, however it will  diminish the 
risk of collusion. 

The fact that oligopolists compete in several markets may or may not increase 
the risk of collusion. As a matter of fact, it will depend on the features of each 
particular market. Vertical integration into key assets of the vertical supply chain 
is somewhat important. It will also depend on the features of each of the markets 
integrated vertically. 

The lack of transparency for customers on best offers available in the market may 
both reduce the level of competition in the market and the possibility to monitor 
competitors’ behaviour. 

12.4. Can you think of any other features of an oligopolistic market with a 
high/substantial risk of tacit collusion? 

Yes. 

12.5.  Please  indicate  which  are  these  other  features  of  an  oligopolistic 
market  with  a  high/substantial  risk  of  tacit  collusion  and  rate  them 
according to their importance from 0 to 4  

Question  12.  3.  of  the  survey  identified  endogenous  market  features  of  an 
oligopolistic market with high risk of tacit collusion but ignores the existence of 
other exogenous market features that can be of relevance such as: 

•  statutory obligations such as price regulation 2 

• 

facilitating  practices  such  as  MFC/MFN  clauses,  signalling  of  prices, 
information exchanges, joint ventures, use of algorithms 3 

(0 = no knowledge/no experience; 1 = no importance 
/no relevance; 2 = somewhat important; 3 = important; 4 = very important).

in oligopolistic markets prone to tacit collusion? 

Although facilitating practices may have pro-competitive effects e.g. exchange of 
information,  they  may  rise  higher  concern  when  they  happen  in  oligopolistic 
markets.

Not applicable / no relevant experience or knowledge. 

12.8.  Please  explain  your  answer  and  identify  the  sectors/markets

•  The  existence  of  an  oligopolistic  market  depends  on  how  markets  are 

defined. 

•  Digital  markets  are  normally 

two-sided  markets,  where 

the 

interdependence among the different actors is more complex.  

•  The  existence  of  economies  of  scale/scope  and  direct/indirect  networks 
effects in digital sectors have a rational impact on concentration levels in 
digital markets.  

•  However, fast innovation in digital and technological markets in general, 
markets may redefine the boundaries of existing markets in short periods

•  There  are  some  facilitating  practices  that  are  specific  to  digital  sectors 
such  as  the  use  of  algorithms.  However,  the  use  of  these  facilitating 
practices involving new AI tools might also be used in markets where there 
are many players. 

13. Do you consider that there is a need for the Commission to be able to 
intervene  in  oligopolistic  markets  prone  to  tacit  collusion  in  order  to 
preserve/improve competition? 

No,  unless  a  breach of  competition  law  is demonstrated under arts 101 & 102 
TFEU. 

13.1. Please explain your answer. 

Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are adequate tools to tackle collusion when it departs 
from a legitimate behaviour in a particular oligopolistic market.  

There  is  neither  a  legal  definition  of  “markets  prone  to  tacit  collusion”  nor 
economic evidence that support or suggest the benefit of an ex ante intervention.

13.3. Please explain your answer. 

Tacit collusion in oligopolistic market situations can be tackled with the existing 
tools, enforcement of Articles 101 and 102, in a case by case scenario or in the 
alternative, with recommendations and sectorial enquiries or even in commitment 
cases where a breach of article 102 TFEU is possible but doubtful.  

The  Commission  has  in  the  past  successfully  intervened  to  address  concerns 
derived from the implementation of facilitating practices, including price signalling 
and the use of MFN clauses.  

An  update  of  the  “Communication  from  the  Commission  —  Guidelines  on  the 
applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 
to  horizontal  co-operation  agreements”  in  order  to  better  define  facilitating 
practices,  particularly  in  new  environments  such  as  digital  sectors,  should  be 
considered in order to facilitate a uniform application of competition law in all the 
member States. 

14. Relying on digital tools, companies may easily align their behavior, in 
particular  retail  prices  via  pricing  algorithms.  (Pricing  algorithms  are 
automated tools that allow very frequent changes to prices and other terms 
taking into account all or most competing offers on the market). 

14.1.  Do  you  have  knowledge  or  did  you  come  across  such  market 
situation? 

No.

The use of pricing tools based on algorithms has exponentially increased in the 
last  years,  particularly  in  the  on  line  markets.  A  significant  number  of  on  line 
suppliers  rely  on  more  or  less  sophisticated  tools  for  pricing  their  products  or 
services in the Internet.   

Despite  the  increasing  use  of  dynamic  pricing  tools,  participants  have  not 
observed  a  generalized  price  alignment  effect  in  on  line  markets  where  these 
tools are typically used (transport, hotel booking or consumer goods).  

We are aware of the solid economic literature that foresees that the extended use 
of  algorithmic  pricing  might  facilitate  tacit  collusion  even  in  non-oligopolistic 
markets  and  that  this  might  result  into  higher  prices  and  less  choice  for 
consumers.

However, as of today, participants have not come across significant evidence to 
conclude that use of algorithmic pricing necessarily results into an alignment in 
prices.  By  contrast,  algorithmic  pricing  could  be  allowing  suppliers  to  respond 
more adequately and effectively to market demand.

  14.4. Please explain your answer above. Please use this space to mention 
other features of markets where pricing algorithms are used and rate their 
importance. 

Algorithmic pricing is essentially used in markets that are transparent and where 
more frequent interactions take place: 

Firstly, algorithms are used in markets with certain degree of transparency. Price 
algorithms  need  information  to  operate.  The  success  of  the  price  algorithm  in 
predicting  how  the  offer  and  demand  will  react  critically  depends  on  the 
information on what other competitors and clients are doing. In markets that are 
not transparent, algorithms cannot successfully predict the behaviour of clients 
and competitors in order to set the right price that guarantees profitability.  

Secondly,  algorithmic  pricing  is  particularly  useful  in  markets  where  there  is  a 
frequent interaction between the supplier and the client. Algorithmic pricing allows 
a dynamic adaptation of the prices to the particular circumstances of the market 
(including  the  prices  that  other  competitors  are  offering  for  similar  products). 
Therefore,  the  more  frequent  the  interaction  between  the  suppliers  and  their 
clients, the more useful becomes the use of a tool to adapt prices to the changing 
circumstances of the market.  

Participants  do  not  contemplate  the  possibility  or  not  of  aligning  prices  as  a 
feature of markets where pricing algorithms typically operate. They observe that 
markets  that  are  not  candidate  prima  facie  for  an  alignment  in  prices  (non-
concentrated markets with differentiated products) have been intensively using 
pricing algorithms (e.g. hotels). 

Participants  consider  that  the  use  of  pricing  algorithms  is  similar  in  digital  and 
non-digital products or services. 

14.5.  Do  you  consider  that  pricing  algorithms  are  common  in  digital 
sectors/markets? 

Yes, common.

See answer to question 14.2 above.  

14.7. In your experience, what are the main competition concerns that arise 
in markets where pricing algorithms are used? 

From a theoretical perspective, the main competition concerns arising in the use 
of pricing algorithms are:  

−  Alignment of prices/less competition between market players. 

−  Price increases. 

−  Less choice for customers. 

14.8. Please explain. 

Algorithmic pricing can predict market trends, better adjust to demand and thus 
generate efficiencies and be procompetitive. However, the main concern from a 
competition  law  perspective  is  that  algorithmic  pricing  could  be  increasing  the 
likelihood of tacit collusion even in markets that do not meet the requirement for 
collusion  (non-concentrated markets  with differentiated products, for example). 
Tacit  collusion  typically  results  into  higher  prices  and  less  choice  for 
consumers.  

15. Do you consider that there is a need for the Commission to be able to 
intervene  in  markets  where  pricing  algorithms  are  prevalent  in  order  to 
preserve/improve competition? 

No.  

15.1. Please explain your answer. 

Participants agree that there is no sufficient empirical evidence of the negative 
effects  of  algorithm  pricing  on  competition  to  justify  a  general  intervention  in 
markets where pricing algorithms prevail.  

This is without prejudice of the use that the Commission could -and should- make 
of the powers of investigation under article 17 of Regulation 1/2003 in case the 
Commission suspects that competition is being distorted in a given market as a 
result of the use of algorithm pricing.   

Indeed,  the  participants  consider  that  sectorial  investigations  could  be  a  most 
useful tool in order to determine if algorithmic pricing is having an anticompetitive 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 28 - 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

effect  in  the  real  world  and  if  such  anticompetitive  effect  can  be  sufficiently 
addressed  under  articles  101  and  102  TFEU  prior  to  adopting  any  legislative 
measure in this regard.   

15.2 Do you consider that Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are suitable 
and  sufficiently  effective  instruments  to  address  all  scenarios  where 
algorithmic pricing can raise competition law issues? 

Yes. 

15.3. Please explain your answer. 

In  the  interest  of  simplicity,  we  can  group  in  three  the  scenarios  where 
algorithmic pricing can raise competition law issues:  

•  Scenario  1: algorithmic  pricing  is used as an  instrument  to  implement  or to 
monitor  price  agreements  between  competitors.  This  includes  “hub-and-
spoke” schemes, where competitors (spokes) use the same third-party pricing 
algorithm (hub) that (potentially) leads to coordinated pricing.   

•  Scenario 2: unilateral use (i.e., without any concertation) of pricing algorithms 
that may lead to collusion because of the collusive features in the algorithm.  

•  Scenario 3: unilateral use of pricing algorithms that increases the likelihood of 
conscious parallelism or tacit collusion because it increases transparency and 
intensifies repeated interaction in the market. 

Participants  agree  that  article  101  TFEU  has  proven  sufficient  to  address 
Scenario  1.  In  the  participants´  view,  article  101  TFEU  is  flexible  enough  to 
address similar cases in the future despite foreseeable challenges, essentially in 
terms of detection and proof. The Eturas case (C-74/14) is a good example of 
adaptability  of  article  101  TFEU  to  new  scenarios  in  which  coordination  is 
facilitated by IT (in this case, an electronic platform).   

Participants also agree that a significant number of cases under Scenario 2 could 
also be covered by article 101 TFEU. The user of the algorithm can be held liable 
under article 101 TFEU for the acceptance of the use of collusive features in the 
design of the algorithm (liability per design). In can also be taken into account at 
the stage of assessing the effects of, for instance, a vertical restraint put in place 
by  a  manufacturer  spreading  more  easily  due  to  the  generalised  use  of  price 
monitoring algorithms by retailers (see, for instance, Cases AT. 40465 Asus, AT. 
40469 Denon & Marantz, AT. 40181 Philips, and AT.40182 Pioneer). 

Admittedly, machine learning could give rise to situations where the decision to 
collude is taken by the algorithm itself without any participation of the programmer 
or  the  user  in  the  decision  –  making  process.  In  these  circumstances,  except 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 29 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

under an undesirable strict liability approach, the user could not be held liable for 
the decision of the algorithm to collude. Strict liability (holding the user liable for 
any outcome of the algorithm, including collusion) is undesirable because it might 
discourage developments in algorithmic pricing. 

In any event, participants consider that there is no sufficient knowledge on how 
machine learning operates and impacts in prices and therefore any intervention 
in this regard would be premature.  

Participants point out that the prohibition of an abuse of a (joint) dominant position 
under  Article  102  TFEU  could  exceptionally  cover  some  cases  where  the 
concertation in terms or article 101 TFEU cannot be established. However, they 
admit  that  its  application  would  be  rather  exceptional  given  the  difficulties  in 
establishing  both  the  existence  of  a  (joint)  dominant  position  and  the  abusive 
pricing behaviour.  

In some cases (provided that the Airtours conditions are met and the adoption of 
the algorithm is seen as a facilitating practice), such conduct could be conceivably 
covered by the prohibition of individual abuses of a collective dominant position 
(validated by the EU Courts in Irish Sugar). The US FTC relied on a similar theory 
of harm under Section 5 of the FTC Act in Ethyl, E.I Du Pont de Nemours c. FTC, 
729, F.2d 128 (2nd Cir. 1984). 

In  any  event,  the  purely  unilateral  use  of  pricing  algorithm  leading  to 
supracompetitive prices as a result of tacit collusion  (Scenario 3) might not be 
tackled under articles 101 and 102 TFEU.  

The possibility of prohibiting tacit collusion has been widely discussed in the past 
in  relation  to  traditional  markets.  This  possibility  has  been  rejected  essentially 
because  it  could  give  rise  to  too  many  false  positive,  including  situations  of 
legitimate adaptation of competitors to the market conditions. 

As  explained  below,  there  is  no  sufficient  evidence  that  the  use  of  pricing 
algorithms  would  necessarily 
to 
supracompetitive prices and reduced choice for customers.

Therefore, it might be too soon to adopt any measure aimed a prohibiting tacit 
collusion through algorithmic pricing (including any measure aimed at widening 
the scope of the term agreement under article 101 TFEU as to  cover collusion 
through algorithms). 

Consequently, participants consider that the European Commission should not 
make  any  substantive  legislative  proposal  or  implement  any  new  ex-ante  tool 
regarding algorithmic pricing until: 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 30 -

• 

It has gained experience in the application of articles 101 and 102 TFEU 
to algorithmic pricing, including the guidance that the European Court of 
Justice provides in the application of such articles to different situations. 

•  There  is  more  solid  empirical  evidence  on  the  negative  impact  of 
algorithmic  pricing  in  competition  (in  the  form  of  higher  price  and  less 
choice for consumers).  

In the meantime, the Commission could: 

•  Consider carrying  out sector inquiries  in  those  markets  where  there  are 
indicators  that  prices  could  be  artificially  high  as  a  result  of  the  use 
algorithmic pricing.   

•  Consider improvements in the tools to detect collusive behaviour on the 
part  of  companies  using  pricing  algorithms  (for  example,  reinforcing 
disclosure obligations and hiring programming experts). 

•  Guarantee that the application of articles 101 (and 102 in some instances) 
TFEU to algorithmic pricing is homogenous by including a specific section 
in the revised Horizontal Cooperation Guidelines.  

16. So-called tipping (or ‘winner takes most’) markets are markets where 
the  number  of  users  is  a  key  element  for  business  success:  if  a  firm 
reaches  a  critical  threshold  of  customers,  it  gets  a  disproportionate 
advantage in capturing remaining customers. Therefore, due to certain 
characteristics  of  that  market,  only  one  or  very  few  companies  will 
remain on those markets in the long term. 

16.1.  Do  you  have  knowledge  or  did  you  come  across  such  market 
situations? 

Yes. 

16.2. Please list and explain those situations and in which markets you 
encountered them. 

Many markets exhibit positive externalities originating from direct or indirect 
network  effects  and  many  companies  across  all  sectors  benefit  from 
economies of scope and scale. The intensity of these features varies, but it 
may  be  particularly  important  in  network  markets,  including,  e.g.  telecoms, 
energy  or  transport.  Digital  markets  also  exhibit  these  features.  These 
characteristics  may  lead  to  some  degree  of  tipping.  The  degree  to  which 
markets may tip depends on product differentiation (one should be cautious 
about  not  narrowing  down  relevant  markets  in  the  light  of  product 
differentiation, as this may often be parameter of competition), interoperability, 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 31 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

multi-homing and possible diminishing returns. Some degree of tipping may 
also be caused by “learning-by-doing” effects.  

Tipping may or may not be anticompetitive; there may be markets that can 
only accommodate  a  limited  number of  firms  or markets  that  operate  more 
efficiently  with  a  limited  number  of  firms.  In  other  markets,  tipping  may  be 
temporary and  may  act  as  an  incentive  to  spur  competition  for the  market. 
Tipping may be a source of concern to the extent that there may be a risk of 
“lock-in”  (i.e.  if  users  do  not  multi-home  and  face  technical  or  economic 
barriers to switching). 

Furthermore,  there  should  not  be  a  presumption  that  companies  that  have 
benefited from tipping effects will not be subject to competition. With hindsight, 
companies  that  10/20  years  ago  seemed  unavoidable  have  now  almost 
disappeared; also, in the technological sector. There is no reason to believe 
that this can/will not occur in time to present market leaders. 

16.3. Please indicate what are in your view, the main market features of 
a  tipping  market.  Please  rate  each  of  the  listed  competition  concerns 
according to its importance. 

All of them “very important”.  

16.4. Please explain your answer, indicating why you consider the above 
features relevant for a tipping market and describe any other feature that 
you consider important. 

Network effects, economies of scale and single-homing are necessary factors 
for  tipping  to  occur,  single-homing  being  the  most  important.  For  anti-
competitive tipping to occur, markets would also need to be characterized by 
technical  and  economic  high  barriers  to  switching/multi-homing  and  lack  of 
differentiation.  Absent  these  barriers  or  even  absent  users  relevant  costs, 
single-homing  may  be  plausibly  explained  by  consumers  (and/or  suppliers) 
unfettered choice. 

One should not lose sight of the fact that network effects, like economies of 
scale,  have  ambiguous  effects  on  competition:  they  may  be  a  source  of 
market  power,  but  they  may  also  be  a  source  of  value,  efficiency  and 
consumer welfare. The assessment of whether their pro or anti-competitive 
potential prevails should be subject to a case-by-case determination.  

An  empirical  approach  is  preferable  to  the  use  of  network  effects  as  an 
argumentative tool capable of supporting far-reaching hypothetical predictions 
and  of  justifying  antitrust  intervention  even  in  absence  of  any  evidence  of 
tipping or market foreclosure.

See answer to Q 16.2 

16.7. In your experience, what are the main competition concerns that 
arise  in  tipping  markets?  Please  rate  each  of  the  listed  competition

All of them “somewhat important” 

16.8. Please explain your answers above. Please also use this space to 
mention  any  other  competition  concerns  that  arise  in  tipping  markets 
and rate their importance. 

All  of  the  concerns  identified  in  Q16.7  are  related  to  the  risk  of  “path 
dependency” (i.e. that tipping and lock-in may lead to the entrenchment of a 
particular  provider/technology/network  in  spite  of  its  possible  inferiority). 
Whether these concerns materialize or not is an empirical question. There are 
markets  often  identified  as  tipping  markets  that  nevertheless  exhibit  high 
degrees  of  innovation,  R&D  investments,  quality  services  and  consumer 
satisfaction. 

17. Do you consider that there is a need for the Commission to be able 
to intervene early in tipping markets to preserve/improve competition? 

No 

17.1. Please explain your answer. 

Competition  law  has  never  been  used  to  fine-tune  markets,  and  new  tools 
should not be focused on “improving” competition by reference to idealized 
benchmarks.  

Similarly,  competition should  not  intervene  “early” in markets before  tipping 
occurs. There  is no  evidence  that  public authorities/private  companies may 
be  able  to  predict  whether  tipping  is  likely  to  occur  in  a  given  market,  nor 
whether tipping, in a given situation, might have positive or negative effects. 
Absent a high degree of certainty, early intervention to prevent tipping might 
be counterproductive. In addition, the possibility of early intervention absent 
dominance, and absent a restriction of competition may be problematic from 
the  point  of  view  of  legal  certainty,  constitutional  elements  (right  to  free

enterprise) and could chill incentives to invest and compete. These negative 
aspects  are  even  more  acute  in  an  scenario  that  so  far  does  not  seem  to 
foresee legal and procedural safeguards similar to Regulation 1/2003. 

Competition  law  can,  and  should,  kick-with  full  strength  in  tipped  markets, 
where  the  leading  provider  will  be  subject  to  strict  “special  responsibility” 
obligations  to  compete  on the  merits  under  Article  102  TFEU in addition  to 
across-the-board limitations under Article 101 TFEU. It should ensure that the 
current “winner takes it all/most” can be challenged by a future “winner takes 
it all/most”, which will probably not be a direct competitor (me-too competition) 
but a challenger coming from an adjacent market.  

17.2. Do you consider that Articles 101/102 of the EU Treaty are suitable 
and  sufficiently  effective  instruments  to  intervene  early  in  ‘tipping 
markets’, to preserve/improve competition? 

Yes. 

17.3. Please explain your answer. 

Articles 101 and 102 have not been used to “improve competition” (with the 
exception of commitment cases under Article. 9 of Regulation 1/2003) under 
the logic that competition law should not second guess companies’ strategies 
absent wrongdoing. They are nonetheless suitable and sufficiently effective 
to  preserve  competition.  For  a  new  competition  tool  to  be  adopted  out  of 
concerns  about  tipping,  it  would  be  important  to  identify  examples  where  a 
new competition tool could have been used to effectively prevent tipping in 
any  real-life  markets.  The  Impact  Assessment  Analysis  does  not  currently 
offer any such examples. 

Articles 101 and 102 have always applied to tipping markets. Already in 2002 
some authors observed that that “[m]any antitrust decisions of the last decade 
refer  to  the  existence  of  network  effects  as  a  clue  that  a  certain  degree  of 
intervention is needed” (see e.g. Pardolesi & Renda, How safe is the king’s 
throne?  Network  externalities  on  trial,  in  Post-Chicago  Developments  In 
Antitrust Law 214, 219 (2002)).  

The EU Courts have also been confronted to “tipping” arguments, including in 
Microsoft (where the Commission observed a risk of tipping and made it an 
important part of the case) and Cisco (where, on the contrary, the Commission 
ruled out the risk of tipping even in presence of strong network effects and 
very limited multi-homing). The current competition law framework allows for 
this evolving and nuanced approaches and gives the Commission sufficient 
margin  of  manoeuvre  to  come  up  with  different  conclusions  in  different 
settings. 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 34 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

The existing tools moreover enable competition authorities to act even when 
a  practice  is  “capable”  of  having  “potential”  anticompetitive  effects.  This, 
combined with the possibility of adopting interim measures, permits forward-
looking precautionary intervention that is backed by solid evidence.  

The Impact Assessment Analysis does not state that a New Competition Tool 
would apply lower legal tests or evidentiary standards but does not state the 
contrary either. If the Commission seeks to maintain similar standards, this is 
welcome  and  should  expressly  indicate  it  so  in  the  future  regulation  and 
establish  also  similar  procedural  safeguards.  However,  if  the  Commission 
seeks to lower standards of intervention and procedural safeguards this could 
run the risk of conflicting with the established case law of the EU Courts. It will 
create  an  unsustainable  degree  of  uncertainty  for  current  (and  future) 
investors and partners in business, reducing future innovation and prosperity.  

In any event, a New Competition Tool having Article 103 TFEU as its legal 
basis could  arguably not  rely on  lower standards  than  those  set by  the  EU 
Courts in its interpretation of Articles 101 and 102 TEFU. 

As  explained  above,  tipping  is not  necessarily problematic  in  itself,  and we 
may not have the ability to predict it or to intervene adequately. In the event 
that a market tips, vigorous enforcement should eliminate any scope for anti-
competitive practices. 

18.1. Have you encountered or are you aware of markets characterised 
by ‘gatekeepers’? 

Yes. 

18.2. Please list which companies you consider to be ‘gatekeepers’ and 
in which markets. 

There is ample experience with companies that may act as “gatekeepers” due 
to their exclusive control of infrastructure (most often physical infrastructure) 
that is indispensable for the provision of a given service (e.g. railway tracks, 
“local loop”, ports, or electricity grids, among others). Some cases also exist 
in the media/broadcasting rights sector (certain broadcasting rights that have 
been considered as a sort of essential facilities for pay tv; for instance, some 
football matches) 

18.3. Do you consider that gatekeeper scenarios are common in digital 
sectors/markets? 

No. 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 35 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

18.4.  Please  explain  your  answer  and  identify  the  sectors/markets 
concerned. 

The use of the term “gatekeeper” would need to be further defined, particularly 
to the extent that it may be invoked to justify an initiative of this relevance. The 
Questionnaire  appears  to  consider  a  “gatekeeper”  as  particularly  important 
intermediaries  that  enable  business  operators  to  reach  customers.  This 
definition may be used to impose a special legal regime upon companies who 
have  been  particularly  successful  at  enabling  trade,  which  is  the  business 
model of any offline or online platform. “Gatekeepers” will only exist if business 
operators have no other alternative means to viably access customers. In real 
life, however, business often have many channels to reach users, even when 
those channels may not be perfect substitutes.  

In  the  recent  Airbnb  Ireland  Judgment  (C-390/18)  for  example,  the  CJEU 
observed at para.55 that “a service such as the one provided by Airbnb Ireland 
is in no way indispensable to the provision of accommodation services, both 
from the point of view of the guests and the hosts who use it, since both have 
a number of other, sometimes long-standing, channels at their disposal, such 
as  estate  agents,  classified  advertisements,  whether  in  paper  or  electronic 
format, or even property lettings websites. In that regard, the mere fact that 
Airbnb Ireland is in direct competition with those other channels by providing 
its  users,  both  hosts  and  guests,  with  an  innovative  service  based  on  the 
particular features of commercial activity in the information society […]”). 

If the Commission seeks to define what a gatekeeper is and impose ex-ante 
obligations or subject them to intervention aside the procedures established 
under Article 102 TFEU, such a definition and characterization of companies 
should be subject to public consultation and the affected entities should have 
the  right  to  provide  alternative  evidence  and  also  to  have  the  decision 
reviewed by the EU courts. 

18.5.  Do  you  consider  that  gatekeeper  scenarios  also  occur  in  non-
digital sectors/markets? 

Yes. 

18.6.  Please  explain  your  answer  and  identify  the  sectors/markets 
concerned. 

As explained above, there is ample experience (notably in utility regulation, 
but not only) regarding companies that may act as “gatekeepers” due to their 
exclusive control of infrastructure (most often physical infrastructure) that is 
indispensable for the provision of a given service (e.g. railway tracks, “local 
loop”, port operators, telecoms infrastructure, etc).

use  the  specific platform=  some  of  the  association members preparing  this 
document  consider it  somewhat  important  whereas  others consider it  of  no 
importance/no relevance. 

18.8.  Please  explain  your  answer,  indicating  why  you  consider  the 
indicated  features  relevant  for  qualifying  a  company  as  a  gatekeeper. 
Please also add any other relevant features that qualify a company as a 
gatekeeper and rate their importance. 

All of the factors identified in Q18.7 are relevant to identifying gatekeepers, 
but they are not sufficient. As explained above, the key criterion should be the 
absence of alternatives to viably reach users.   

The fact that business operators need to accept the conditions of competition 
of the platform is inherent to most platforms, as well as to most distributors 
and business (see for instance an insurance or a financial entity as well any 
business  with  mass  contracts  with  consumers).  The  ability  to  set  “platform 
rules” is particularly important in multi-sided settings (either digital platforms 
or physical platforms: for instance auction operators such as Sotheby’s, as a 
mere example).  

Indeed,  economic  theory  (e.g.  Rochet  and  Tirole)  shows  that  the  role  of  a 
platform  (and  we  do  not  see  why  a  difference  should  exist  between  digital 
platforms and operators that connect offer and demand in off-line markets) is 
precisely to set rules capable of attracting all sides, maximizing value while 
preventing  negative  externalities.  Competition  law  experience  reveals  that 
second-guessing  the  conditions  of  access  to  a  given  platform  or  asset  is 
fraught with difficulties. 

One  of  the  features  identified  in  Q18.7  refers  to  the  need  to  accept  the 
business  conditions  of  the  platform  “to  reach  the  customers  that  use  the 
specific platform”. The formulation of the question seems to conflate different 
questions (i.e. customers that use the specific platform with customers in the 
relevant market). The fact that a platform may somewhat have control over

(exclusive or not-exclusive) access to its customers is not in itself problematic 
or the source of concerns. Problems may only arise when the platform at issue 
controls  an  asset  that  is  indispensable  for  rivals  to  operate  viably  in  an 
adjacent market.

arise in markets featuring a gatekeeper? Please rate each of the listed

terms and conditions=somewhat important. 

18.10. Please explain your answers above. Please also use this space to 
mention any other competition concerns that arise in markets featuring 
a gatekeeper and rate them in importance. 

Any successful platform must be able to exercise some degree of control over 
the competitive environment that it has created. Platform rules in these setting 
may  be  positive  or  negative  from  a  welfare  standpoint.  Business  operators 
may accept those conditions as the terms of access to the platform; they are 
likely  to  do  so  only  when  access  to  the  platform  would,  overall,  be 
advantageous to them.  

When setting platform rules, platform sponsors need to balance the interests 
of all stakeholders in order to further the competitiveness of the platform as a 
whole. Asymmetric treatment (e.g. skewed pricing) is inherent to this business 
models and is often their distinctive feature. Asymmetric treatment should not 
be confused with discrimination. Similarly, the assessment of platform rules 
should consider their effects on all sides of the platform.  

Whether a given rule or restraint is permissible or not should be assessed by 
reference  to  the  competition  that  would  exist  in  a  realistic,  likely  and 
economically  viable  counterfactual  and  having  regard  to  the  economic  and 
legal  context  at  issue  in  every  case.  This  would  be  consistent  with  the 
established case law of the EU Courts in cases involving multi-sided business 
models,  such  as  Cartes  Bancaires,  Mastercard  and  Budapest  Bank. 
Interventions should only challenge platform conduct that restricts competition 
that would have existed in their absence.

The  main  concern  arising  from  genuine  “gatekeeper”  scenarios  is  that  of 
“output foreclosure” (i.e. if business operators are prevented from accessing 
customers).  This  risk  should,  however  be  mitigated  by  the  fact  that  it  is 
generally in the platforms best interest to act as catalysts and create business 
opportunities for its stakeholders. Platforms should therefore generally have 
the incentives to create value for all of the members of the ecosystem. 

As in the case of Q18.7, one of the features identified in Q18.9 refers to the 
need to accept the business conditions of the platform “to reach the customers 
that  use  the  specific  platform”.  The  formulation  of  the  question  seems  to 
conflate different questions (i.e. customers that use the specific platform with 
customers  in  the  relevant  market).  The  fact  that  a  platform  may  somewhat 
have control over (exclusive or not-exclusive) access to its customers is not 
in itself problematic or the source of concerns. Problems may only arise when 
the  platform  at  issue  controls  an  asset  that  is  indispensable  for  rivals  to 
operate viably in an adjacent market. 

19. Do you consider that there is a need for the Commission to be able 
to  intervene  in  gatekeeper  scenarios  to  prevent/address  structural 
competition problems? 

No. 

19.1. Please explain your answer. 

The  European  Commission  should  retain  its  current  ability  to  intervene  in 
gatekeeper  scenarios  and  to  apply  the  law  on  the  bases  of  the  analytical 
frameworks set by the EU Courts. For enforcement to be more effective and 
timely, we would call for competition authorities to enjoy greater resources. 
There are no clear “gatekeeper” issues that are currently not addressed either 
by the competition rules or by regulatory initiatives, including the GDPR and 
the Platform-to-Business Regulation. 

19.2  Do  you  consider  that  Articles  101  and  102  of  the  EU  Treaty  are 
suitable  and  sufficiently  effective  instruments  to  intervene  in  markets 
characterised  by  ‘gatekeeper  platforms’  in  order  to  preserve/improve 
competition? 

Yes. 

19.3. Please explain your answer. 

Over the past few years competition authorities and Courts from all over the 
world  have  grappled  with  issues  relating  to  network  effects,  multi-sided 
markets and platforms. In the EU we now benefit from a clear and balanced 
framework that factors in the relevant trade-offs in the application of Articles 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 39 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

101 and 102 TFEU. The Commission has succeeded in challenging platform 
restrictions  in  multi-sided  settings  in  a  variety  of  cases,  including  cases 
involving  Microsoft,  Google,  and  in  a  number  of  payment  card  cases.  The 
adoption  of  a  new  competition  tool  on  the  basis  of  “gatekeeper”  concerns 
would require the clear identification of real life-cases where Articles 101 and 
1022 have fell short that currently do not appear to have been put forward.  

Multi-sided  platforms  are  mainly  characterized  by  the  complexity  of  cross-
market interactions. This may be a challenge for competition enforcement as 
it adds an additional layer of complexity. However, as recently emphasized by 
the CJEU in Budapest Bank (C-228/18, para. 80), the complexity inherent to 
these settings does not justify relying on inadequate presumptions in either 
direction; restrictions, like efficiencies, must be established by reference to the 
relevant economic and legal context and a realistic counterfactual.  

Moreover, if a new competition tool is finally established, it should be only for 
clear  and  undisputed  cases  where  the  accumulated  experience  (and  EU 
courts  as  well  have  confirmed)  shows  that  they  give  rise  to  a  very  high 
likelihood  of  anticompetitive  effects.  The  approach  would  be  similar  to  the 
concept of restrictions “by object” that are prohibited “per se” under Art. 101 
TFEU even if the conduct did not have effects. If a conduct or a situation is 
ex-ante  subject  to  possible  intervention,  and  even  more,  to  possible 
enforcement  measures  and  remedies,  it  should  be  undisputed  that  this 
intervention is justified and has a preventive character of a loss for competition 
that will very likely take place otherwise. 

In  which  sectors/markets  do  you  consider  that  structural 

20. 
competition problems may occur? 

Structural competition problems may occur in some specific sectors/markets 
(including but not only digital sectors/markets). 

20.1. Please explain your answer and identify the sectors/markets your 
reply refers to. 

Experience  with  sector  inquiries  at  the  EU  level  as  well  as  the  CMA’s 
experience  with  regard  to  market  investigations  shows  that  concerns  may 
exist across a wide variety of sectors. 

21.  If  in  response  to  question  7  you  indicated  that  other  forms  of 
structural  competition  problems  in  addition  to  the  ones  listed  above 
exist, do you consider that there is a need for the Commission to be able 
to  intervene  in  order  to  address  these  other  forms  of  structural 
competition problems in order to preserve/improve competition? 

No.

21.2.  Do  you  consider  that  Articles  101  and  102  of  the  EU  Treaty  are

forms of structural competition problems? 

Yes – N/A 

22.  Article  101  of  the  EU  Treaty  prohibits  agreements  between 
companies which prevent, restrict or distort competition in the EU and 
which  may  affect  trade  between  Member  States  (anti-competitive 
agreements). These include, for example, price-fixing or market-sharing 
cartels.  Is  Article  101  of  the  EU  Treaty,  in  your  view,  a  suitable  and 
sufficiently  effective  instrument  to  address  structural  competition 
problems? 

Yes. 

22.1. Please explain your answer. If you replied ‘no’, please indicate the 
types of conduct and situations that in your view, Article 101 of the EU 
Treaty does not sufficiently or effectively address, and why. 

As  explained  in  other  replies,  Article  101  TFEU  is  built  on  imprecise  legal 
concepts and has a remarkably wide scope. Beyond the examples offered in 
Q22, it has also been applied, for example, in cases involving platform rules 
(e.g.  Microsoft,  Visa  and  Mastercard  cases),  price  signalling  in  oligopolistic 
settings  (e.g.  in  the  liner  shipping  sector),  and  in  technological  collusion 
scenarios (e.g. in Eturas, Case, C-74/14). The interpretation of this provision 
is flexible enough to accommodate any reality that may involve concertation 
or a meeting of minds. Under Regulation 1/2003, the Commission also enjoys 
very wide remedial powers to give effects to these provisions. 

There is ample consensus among the members of the association that a new 
competition  tool  should  not  be  used  in  a  way  that  would  lower  the  existing 
standards of intervention set by the case law of the EU Courts under Arts 101 
and 102 TFEU. In particular, it would not be sufficient to show that there is a 
‘risk’ of anticompetitive outcomes or that such outcomes are plausible. Such 
a threshold of intervention would in effect justify intervention in virtually any 
instance,  thereby  jeopardising  the  delicate  balance  between  intervention  in 
the public interest and companies’ rights and freedoms. Some members have 
pointed to the need to ensure timely enforcement and proper remedy design.

23.  Article  102  of  the  Treaty  prohibits  any  abuse  by  one  or  more 
undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a

Is  Article  102  of  the  Treaty,  in  your  view,  suitable  and  sufficiently 
effective to address structural competition problems? 

Yes. 

23.1. Please explain your answer. If you replied ‘no’, please indicate the 
type of conduct and situations that in your view, Article 102 of the EU 
Treaty does not sufficiently or effectively address, and why. 

Article 102 TFEU is based on imprecise legal concepts and has a remarkably 
wide  scope  of  application.  It  is  a  provision  that  the  Commission  has 
successfully  deployed  to  challenge  a  wide  array  of  business  practices  in 
complex settings. Reliance on this provision going forward may, moreover, be 
facilitated in the near future following the ongoing review of the 1997 market 
definition  Notice,  which  may  facilitate  the  finding  of  intra-platform  relevant 
markets. 

Under  Regulation  1/2003,  the  Commission  also  enjoys  very  wide  remedial 
powers to give effects to these provisions. 

There is ample consensus among the members of the association that a new 
competition  tool  should  not  be  used  in  a  way  that  would  lower  the  existing

D. Assessment of policy options 

24. In light of your responses to the questions of Section C, do you think 
that  there  is  a  need for  a  new  competition  tool  to  deal  with  structural 
competition  problems  that  Articles  101  and  102  of  the  EU  Treaty  (on 
which  current  competition  law  enforcement  is  based)  cannot  tackle 
conceptually or cannot address in the most effective manner? (Article

101  of  the  EU Treaty  prohibits  agreements  between  companies  which 
prevent, restrict or distort competition in the EU and which may affect 
trade  between  Member  States  (anti-competitive  agreements).  These 
include, for example, price-fixing or market-sharing cartels. Article 102 
of  the  Treaty  prohibits  any  abuse  by  one  or  more  undertakings  of  a 
dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of 
it.) 

No. 

24.1.  Please  explain  your  answer.  Please  indicate  which  structural 
competition problems the new tool should tackle or address. 

Most of our members believe that Competition law, and particularly Articles 
101  and  102  TFEU,  are  effective  and  sufficiently  broad  and  flexible 
instruments to fight against most competition problems – including structural 
ones - arising in all sorts of markets, from traditional to most innovative ones. 
In  our  answer  to  section  C  we  have  referred  to  many  precedents  affecting 
digital markets (e.g. Microsoft, Cisco, Google cases, current investigations on 
Apple activities, Amazon Marketplace, etc.) which show that market abuses 
and  restrictive  agreements  (either  horizontal  or  vertical)  can  be  effectively 
tackled by using current legislation and enforcement tools by the European 
Commission and by national Competition authorities.  

Moreover,  in  relation  with  structural  competition  conditions  of  any  specific 
market, Merger Control mechanisms also play an important role, whenever a 
player tries to increase its power in any market by acquiring control over other 
companies (this is a very common way to proceed, as experience has showed 
in digital markets). 

Hence, effective protection of consumers and players in new digital markets 
can  be achieved  through  the  enforcement  of  the  currently existing rules;  in 
particular,  we  believe  that  the  currently  existing  rules  can  guarantee  an 
appropriate  balance  between  the  principles  of  an  open  and  free  economy, 
legal  certainty  and  the  limits  imposed  to  dominant  players  whenever  they 
abuse  of  their  market  power  (acting  as  gatekeepers,  limiting  access  to 
essential  facilities  in  new  markets,  imposing  unfair  trading  conditions  to 
entrants or other players in the market, etc.). 

In particular, different legal tests have been developed by case law, especially 
in the field of abuse of dominance, to strike a delicate balance between i) the 
restriction of rights of (even dominant) companies under national constitutions 
and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the “Charter”), 
on  the  one hand, and  ii) the  need for public  intervention  to  avoid a  greater 
harm to the general interest in undistorted competition, on the other hand. An

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

illustrative  example  is  provided  by  the  essential  facilities  doctrine,  which 
imposes stringent conditions (the so-called “exceptional circumstances”) with 
a view to pondering an intense interference on dominant companies’ freedom 
to  conduct  a  business  (enshrined  in  Article  16  of  the  Charter)  as  is  the 
mandate  to  deal  against  the  greater  harm  represented  by  the  removal  of 
effective  competition  in  a  market.  We  are,  in  general,  afraid  that  a  new 
competition tool may tamper with this careful balance by lowering the standard 
for intervention. 

Additionally,  although  it  is  true  that  some  structural  problems  may  exist  in 
markets where no dominant player can be identified, we believe this can be 
considered as an exceptional situation, as most markets where no dominant 
players  –  either individual or collective  –  can  be  identified  offer competitive 
solutions to players and consumers.  

implemented  by 

As to the possible structural problems affecting specific markets, we believe 
that the use if the new competition tool is in general not justified in view of the 
specific  ex  ante  sectorial  regulation 
the  European 
Commission. The existing ex-ante regulation could also be an effective tool, 
which  could  complement  the  current  competition  rules  (most  of  them  to  be 
applied ex post, in case of infringement of the rules by companies) and ensure 
that  access  and  operation  in  these  markets  by  independent  players  is 
competitive  enough.  Again,  there  are  many  examples  of  successful 
combination  of  ex  ante  sectorial  regulation  with  ex  post  enforcement  of 
competition law in the telecoms, energy, postal, financial or transport markets. 
We believe this combination is an appropriate way to impose  – if needed – 
some limits to players in the market, and at the same time providing them with 
legal certainty as to their rights and obligations. The new tool would lead to 
and additional and, hence, disproportionate limitation and above all, a source 
of legal and economic uncertainty in these sectors that may reduce incentives 
to invest in them in the EU.  

At this point, and for digital markets in particular -which seems to be one of 
the main concerns and drivers of the proposed new tool- clearly the need for 
the new tool cannot be analysed in isolation from the proposal of Digital 
Services  Act  package  that  is  subject  to  a  parallel  consultation  (the 
“Proposal”).  

   The AEDC is not making specific comments to the Proposal, although 
[many/the  majority?]  of  the  members  that  participate  in  this  paper 
consider that is not needed nor adequate for several reasons many of 
which coincide with the ones that leads us to believe that the new tool is 
not necessary either.  

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 44 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

   Nonetheless  if  the  Commission  were  finally  decided  to  adopt  such  a 
legislative  package,  again,  there  would  be  a  duplicity  of  tools  and 
overlapping measures, whose combination and limits are very uncertain, 
for digital markets in general, and more particularly for online platforms 
that  in  the  Commission’s view,  act  as  “gatekeepers”  (the  “Gatekeeper 
Rules”).  

   As a mere example, the Proposal mentions that for Gatekeeper Rules, 
it could be possible to impose remedies “where considered necessary 
and  justified  following  a  prior  assessment”.    If  this  prior  assessment 
process  affects  more  than  one  company  and  is  closer  to  a  sectorial 
investigation, there is no real clear cut difference between this ex-ante 
new regulation  and  the  scope  of  the  new competition tool.  Confusion, 
legal  uncertainty  and  risk  of  duplicities  and  contradictory  approaches 
between these two ex-ante measures (one of regulatory character and 
the other more optional but also of regulatory nature) should be avoided.  

the  new  competition 

   Moreover,  if  the  Commission  follows  the  “blacklist  option”  for  the 
Proposal, which would be the preferred one by the AEDC (if any), as it 
provides more legal certainty and meets the goal of ex-ante regulation 
(i.e., prior identification of prohibited acts and obligations in markets with 
structural  problems),  introducing  additional  uncertainty  and  burdens 
under 
tool  would  be  unjustified  and 
disproportionate. In fact, operators in digital markets would be subject to 
specific  regulations  with  the  goal  to  prevent  ex-ante  competition  risks 
and also can be subject to additional ex-ante remedies and regulations 
even in cases of no infringement of competition laws (arts. 101 & 102 
TFEU).  This  would  be  contradictory  and  a  demonstration  that  the  ex-
ante regulation has failed. Instead of introducing through the back door 
ad-hoc  remedies  when  the  “ex-ante  regulations”  have  not  worked  as 
they were not well defined or did not cover an specific new ambit, what 
the Commission should do is to review/revisit on a regular basis such 
legislative  ex-ante  legislative  package  and  adapt  it.  However,  the 
Commission  should  not  use  the  new  tool  as  a  sort  of  blanket  tool  to 
correct the gaps of its ex-ante regulation.  

In this same line, and also concerning digital markets, the need for the 
new tool should be analysed taking into account other pieces of ex-ante 
regulation which seek directly or indirectly to ensure that digital markets 
remain  competitive,  consumers  are  not  harmed  and  that  operators 
(including the so called, gatekeepers and online platforms) do not incur 
into “unfair” practices (which is a test well below Art. 102 TFEU). Inter 
alia, we may refer to:

o  Directive 2019/2161, amending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and 
Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU of the European 
Parliament and of the Council as regards the better enforcement 
and  modernisation  of  Union  consumer  protection  rules.  This 
Directive addresses relevant aspects that were supposed to be 
“gaps” under the new competition tool, such as rankings of offers 
in on-line marketplaces and on-line search results (whereas 17 to 
26), portability of personal data and of digital content...,  

o  Geoblocking Regulation 2018/302; 

o  Regulation  (EU)  2019/1150  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of 
the  Council  of  20  June  2019  on  promoting  fairness  and 
transparency for business users of online intermediation services. 
This  regulation  establishes  clear  limits  of  possible  “unfair 
practices” by online intermediation service providers, which can 
be  assimilated  to  a  large  extent  to  marketplaces  and  digital 
platforms (see for instance, paragraph 2: “Given that increasing 
dependence, the providers of those services often have superior 
bargaining  power,  which  enables  them  to,  in  effect,  behave 
unilaterally in a way that can be unfair and that can be harmful to 
the legitimate interests of their businesses users and, indirectly, 
also  of  consumers  in  the  Union.  For  instance,  they  might 
unilaterally  impose  on  business  users  practices  which  grossly 
deviate from good commercial conduct, or are contrary to good 
faith and fair dealing. This Regulation addresses such potential 
frictions  in  the  online  platform  economy”.  Article  10  addresses 
MNF clauses. 

Furthermore, should the competition tool be finally adopted, it is worth 
noting that it entails a substantial restriction of the right to property and the 
freedom to pursue a trade or profession (enshrined in Articles 16 and 17 of 
the Charter, see  supra). As such, it cannot be used to “fill the gaps”,  but 
only  as  last  resort  and  in  compliance  with  Art.  52  of  the  Charter.  This 
implies, in particular, that it can only be used on condition that it complies 
with the principle of proportionality. Accordingly: 

(i)  

if there are other less restrictive means to achieve the same objectives 
-including the new Proposal of ex-ante regulation for digital markets or 
an  amendment  of  other  already  existing  ex-ante  regulations  in  other 
sectors  (telecoms,  energy,  etc.)-,  that  address,  in  full  or  in  part,  the 
problems aimed  by  the  new competition tool,  the  latter  should not  be 
enforced. Otherwise, the new competition tool may be incompatible with 
the proportionality and necessity test of art. 52 of the Charter; 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 46 - 

 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

(ii)  

the drafting  of the new competition tool (if any) should clearly require 
the  Commission  to  thoroughly  analyse  any  other  alternatives  to  the 
enforcement of the new competition tool and also to duly state reasons 
each  time  it  wishes  to  apply  it  indicating  why  the  Commission  has 
discarded the other alternative tools at its disposal (as mentioned, i.e., 
adapting  existing  ex-ante  regulation  or  introducing  new  one,  soft-law 
inquiries/investigations,  commitment 
recommendations,  sectorial 
decisions  under  art.  9  of  Regulation  1/2003,  merger  control  (if 
applicable) and above all, procedures under Arts. 101 or 102 TFEU. 

All  in  all,  based  on  the  above,  the  European  Commission  should  carefully 
consider whether the new competition tool is indeed needed and, if so, clearly 
identify the so-called “gap cases” that cannot be effectively analysed under 
Article 101 and 102 TFEU -and in the worsk case scenario, for digital markets, 
also with the new Proposal if finally adopted- and would justify an intervention 
through  this  new  tool.  In  particular,  the  European  Commission  should  be 
cautious while intervening in markets prone to “tipping”, which is one of the 
new  competition  tool’s  key  areas  according  to  the  Inception  Impact 
Assessment. In fact, tipping should not be regarded as anticompetitive per se 
and an early intervention, in the absence of dominance and a restriction of 
competition,  could  be detrimental for  innovation  and  competition  as  well as 
problematic from a legal certainty standpoint.

establish an infringement by a company and would not result in fines) 
should  also  be  able  to  prevent  structural  competition  problems  from 
arising and thus allow for early intervention in the markets concerned? 

No. 

25.1.  Please  explain  your  answer.  Please  indicate  which  structural 
competition problems the new tool should prevent. 

As indicated in answer to question 24, we believe there is no real need for a 
new competition tool in order to effectively face most - if not all of them - of 
the specific problems of emerging new markets, as current Competition Law 
(in  particular  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU,  but  also  Merger  Control 
mechanisms),  together  with  ex  ante  sectorial  regulation,  whenever  needed 
(as it is the case in Telecoms, Energy, Postal, Financial or Transport markets), 
have demonstrated to be effective tools in order to tackle most structural and 
behavioural restrictions of competition, either unilateral (abuses of unilateral 
dominant position) or multilateral (abuses of collective dominant position and 
restrictive agreements between companies).

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

We  must  bear  in  mind  that  the  European  Commission  could  impose 
behavioural  and  structural  remedies  under  the  current  regime  and  has  the 
power  to  make  them  binding  commitments  under  Article  9  of  Regulation 
1/2003.  Article  9  does  not  require  to  establish  a  clear  cut  competition 
infringement  (for  instance  a  clear  abuse  of  dominant  position)  but  a 
reasonable theory of harm and likely risk of competition. Only if the company 
concerned is not wishing to provide remedies satisfactory to the Commission 
the  latter  would  have  to  pursue  a  complete  infringement  case  for  imposing 
remedies.  Nonetheless,  Article  9  is  indeed  a  well  suited  mechanism  to 
address some of the concerns that the Commission is pursuing with the new 
tool.  

In addition, merger control mechanisms have also proved to be an efficient 
way  to  impose  some  limits,  ex  ante,  to  companies  preventing  them  from 
distorting  competition  not  only  in  highly  concentrated  markets,  but  also  in 
markets where structural competition problems may arise. 

Structural  problems  have  been  identified  in  the  past  in  relation  with  many 
markets.  In  some  cases,  this  has  motivated  the  establishment  of  ex  ante 
regulation guaranteeing access and fair trade conditions in those markets (e.g 
access  to  essential  energy  or  telecom  networks  and  facilities  which  are 
essential for the provision of services in downstream / retail markets).  In other 
cases, competition law has been applied whenever a dominant company has 
used  its  market  power  with  exploitative  or  exclusionary  purposes.  Some  of 
these cases have motivated the imposition of behavioural or even structural 
remedies to parties – not only economic sanctions – which are effective tools 
to redress some of the structural problems identified.  

Structural  and  behavioural  remedies  are  also  very  frequently  imposed  to 
companies in merger control cases in order to redress structural competition 
problems in specific markets even before a dominant position is identified or 
abuse is committed. 

As we stated before, we understand that structural problems in markets where 
no dominant position by any player – either individual or collective - can be 
identified should not be that frequent. 

In  any  event,  those  markets  that  are  more  prone  to  the  sort  of  structural 
problems  that  come  to  mind  when  thinking  of  the  new  competition  tool 
(platform-based  digital  markets)  are  characterized  by  ambivalent  network 
effects.  Depending  on  a  complex  case-by-case analysis  of  switching  costs, 
indirect network effects may either create barriers to entry and expansion (i.e. 
positive feedback loop reinforcing strong brand effects and, in the worst-case 
scenario,  customer  lock-in)  or  make  large  market  positions  contestable 
(through  multi-homing  or  one-click-away  competition  in  the  presence  of

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

portability and interoperability). These effects may play out one way or another 
and, therefore, its assessment should be related to a specific theory of harm 
(be it abusive leveraging or merger-specific significant impediment to effective 
competition). However, we are, in general, uncertain that such effects can be 
judged undesirable in abstract as a matter of structural characteristics of the 
market and justify intervention through the new competition tool. 

26.  What  are  in  your  view  the  most  important  structural  competition 
problems that should be tackled with such a new competition tool? 

We refer to our answer to questions 24 and 25, which motivate why current 
Competition  Law  –  together  with  sectorial  ex  ante  regulation,  whenever 
needed  –  could  effectively  tackle  with  most  kind  of  structural  competition 
problems arising in new and emerging markets.  

In case that the European Commission considers it necessary to introduce a 
new competition tool, probably problems related to market access are those 
which  should  be  the  priority  of  such  new  instrument.  In  particular,  the 
European  Commission  should  ensure  that  i)  there  is  an  unavoidable  (or  at 
least very important) point of entry or bottleneck (as the market for client PC 
operating systems was deemed to be for access to the market for work group 
server operating systems in the Microsoft case – not to mention more recent 
cases still under debate); ii) there are significant and permanent barriers to 
entry  and  expansion  in  the  bottleneck  (even  if  the  European  Commission 
decides not to make dominance a requirement); and iii) effective competition 
either  in  the  bottleneck  market  or  for  the  adjacent  market  is  distorted  (e.g. 
dominant  company’s  leveraging  the  in  the  bottleneck  market  or  self-
preferencing  its  business  in  the  adjacent  market,  to  put  it  in  terms  of 
dominance). 

27. In your view, what should be the basis for intervention for the new 
competition tool? 

If  adopted,  respondents  believe  that  the  tool  should  focus  on  structural 
competition problems and thus be potentially applicable to all undertakings in 
a market (i.e. including dominant but also non-dominant companies) as far as 
the  criteria  mentioned  in  the  response  to  the  previous  question  or  similar 
conditions  set  to  establish  certain  distortion  of  effective  competition,  as  a 
result of high and permanent barriers to entry and expansion, are met.

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

As  indicated  in  our  answer  to  the  questions  24  to  26  above,  respondents 
believe that no new competition tool is needed to tackle with most structural 
competition problems which could be identified in new & emerging markets, 
such as the digital or digitized ones. 

Without  prejudice  of  the  above,  respondents  also  believe  that,  should  the 
European  Commission  consider  it  necessary  to  introduce  such  a  new 
competition ex ante tool, it should focus on structural competition problems 
and thus be potentially applicable to all undertakings in a market (i.e. including 
dominant but also non-dominant companies). 

The  reason  why  we  propose  that  the  new  tool  should  be  applicable  to  all 
companies is that we understand that Article 102 of the TFEU is an effective 
tool  which  can  already  be  used  to  tackle  with  most  kind  of  structural 
competition problems which arise in markets where a dominant player can be 
identified. In these situations, the investigation of possible abusive conducts 
can  result  in  the  imposition  of  behavioural  or  structural  remedies  to  the 
dominant  player  which  help  to  redress  the  structural  problems  (such  as 
access  to  the  market  in  fair  conditions,  lack  of  discrimination,  control  of 
potential excessive prices, control of potentially exclusionary conducts such 
as tying strategies, loyalty rebates, etc.). 

As explained above, we understand that, if the European Commission were 
to conclude that a new competition tool is to operate regardless of dominance 
but on the basis of a vague notion of “market power”, it should still be subject 
to legally certain criteria based on distorted effective competition as a result 
of significant and permanent barriers to entry and expansion in strategically 
important points of access. 

28. In your view, what shall be the scope of the new competition tool? 

It  shall  be  limited  in  scope  to  sectors/markets  where  clear  structural 
competition problems are the most prevalent and/or most likely to arise. Such 
could be the case of, for example (but not limited to) multi-sided platforms or 
ecosystems where concentration is liable to stem from network effects, and, 
if these were to result in barriers to entry and expansion (which as mentioned 
above  is  not  necessarily  always  the  case),  they  would  confer  on  certain 
companies gatekeeper powers to set the competitive conditions in the same 
or  an  adjacent  market.  It  is  important  to  note  that  respondents  for  not 
recommend  a  “sectorial”  tool (for instance,  only for digital, much  less  if  the 
parallel legislative regulation ex-ante Proposal is adopted -see Q24 above). If 
the tool is finally implemented, it should have a horizontal character and be 
applied in general to sectors that present permanent (not transitory) and clear 
structural  problems  that  competition  dynamics  and  other  tools  at  the 
Commission’s disposal (see answer to Q.24 above) cannot solve.

N/A 

28.1.  Please  explain  your  answer.  If  you  indicated  ‘limited  in  scope’, 
please  indicate  what  sectors/markets  should  be  covered  by  the  new 
competition tool, and why. 

As previously indicated, we believe that Competition Law provides European 
authorities  (administrative  and  judicial  ones)  with  effective  ex  ante  tools 
(merger control, state aid control) and ex post tools (prohibition of horizontal 
and  vertical  restrictive  agreements,  prohibition  of  abuses  of  dominant 
positions)  in  order  to  tackle  most  structural  competition  problems  arising  in 
many  different  markets.  European  and  national  courts  of  justice  have 
developed - and still do - a complete case law which ensures that these rules 
are applied with due respect of citizens and companies’ rights. This results in 
a  good balance  between administrative enforcement powers,  on one hand, 
and  the  principles  of  legal  certainty  and  free  economy  which  govern  our 
markets, on the other hand. 

A  new  competition  tool  which  would  work  ex  ante,  without  the  need  of 
identifying  any  infringement  of  competition  rules  by  any  company,  could 
represent a significant limitation to free economy and free development of the 
markets and may also affect fundamental rights (right to property in case of 
structural remedies, for instance). As mentioned in our response to question 
24, from the legal point of view, respondents are, in general, afraid that a new 
competition tool could jeopardise the delicate balance between intervention in 
the  public  interest  and  companies’  rights  and  freedoms  by  lowering  the 
different standards that case law has developed for each type of infringement 
according to its potential harm to welfare. Also the proposal would lead to a 
divergent  approach  and  possible  interpretation  of  what  is  prohibited  or  not 
under competition rules, distorting the consistency in the application of Arts. 
101 and 102 TFEU. From the economic point of view, type I errors could lead 
to unintended consequences in rapidly evolving markets where new business 
could be nipped in the bud. 

This  is  why  respondents  believe  that,  should  the  European  Commission 
consider it necessary to have such a new tool, it should have a limited scope. 
More specifically, if finally adopted, the new competition tool should be limited 
in  scope  to  sectors/markets  where  structural  competition  problems  are  the 
most prevalent and/or most likely to arise, and fulfil certain criteria based on 
distorted  effective  competition  as  a  result  of  significant  and  permanent 
barriers to entry and expansion in strategically important points of access.

28.2. Do you consider that the new competition tool should apply only 
to markets/sectors affected by digitisation? 

No. 

28.3. Please explain your answer, indicating what markets/sectors you 
would consider as affected by digitisation. 

The  European  Commission  has  identified  some  structural  problems  which 
arise in markets affected by digitisation which apparently cannot be effectively 
tackled  with  currently  existing  competition  laws  and  ex  ante  sectorial 
regulations. 

Although respondents do not share that starting premise, it is true that new & 
emerging markets, with new distribution channels  - such as apps, or online 
services – have characteristics which are quite particular, including the zero 
pricing,  the  relevance  of  personal  data,  strong  network  effects,  etc.  This  is 
something typical from services which have been digitised. Nowadays, more 
and more services are being digitised; and we believe that, if finally adopted, 
the new competition tool should be applied in relation to any market where 
digital and online services are provided, provided that criteria are set in order 
to ensure that significant and permanent barriers to entry and expansion in 
important point of access may lead to distorted effective competition.    

This  notwithstanding,  as  indicated  in  our  response  to  question  28.1  above, 
respondents  believe  that,  if  the  Commission  finally  decides  to  adopt  a  new 
competition tool, the new instrument should be subject to certain criteria along 
the  aforementioned  lines  (related  to  significant  and  permanent  barriers  to 
entry and  expansion  in  important  point of  access), and  it  will  be  in  practice 
essentially limited to digital markets (but without ruling out the possibility for 
other markets to also fulfil these criteria). 

29.  If  a  new  competition  tool  were  to  be  introduced,  how  should  a 
smooth interaction with existing sector specific legislation (e.g. telecom 
services, financial services) be ensured? 

Respondents understand that existing sector specific legislation provides very 
important legal certainty to players acting in the fields which are the object of 
such  regulations  (telecoms,  energy,  transport,  financial  or  postal  services). 
Because of the existence of written and objective rules, companies of any size 
(incumbent players and new entrants) acting in these strategic markets are 
perfectly aware of their rights and obligations. 

AEDC: Comentarios Consulta NCT (Sección C)  - 52 - 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

If a new competition ex ante tool were to be introduced, it would be essential 
not to distort such legal certainty. Therefore, detailed guidance on the criteria 
of enforcement by the European or national authorities of any new competition 
tool  should  be  provided  to  companies,  especially  if  the  new  tool  allows 
authorities to investigate behaviors where no infringements at all of the law 
can be identified. 

30.  Do  you  consider  that  under  the  new  competition  tool  the 
Commission should be able to: 

•  Make  non-binding  recommendations  to  companies  (e.g.  proposing 
codes of conducts and best practices): Yes, if at all. 

•  Inform and make recommendations/proposals to sectorial regulators: 
Yes, if at all. 

•  Inform and make legislative recommendations: Yes, if at all. 

•  Impose  remedies  on  companies

identified  and 

30.1. Please explain your answers indicating why you consider that the 
new competition tool should include or not include the options above. 

As indicated in our answer to questions 24 to 26, respondents believe there 
is  no  real  need  for  a  new  competition  tool  in  order  to  effectively  face  the 
specific problems of emerging new markets, as current Competition Law (in 
particular Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, but also Merger Control mechanisms), 
together with ex ante sectorial regulation, whenever needed (as it is the case 
in  Telecoms,  Energy,  Postal,  Financial  or  Transport  markets),  have 
demonstrated  to  be  effective  tools  in  order  to  tackle  most  restrictions  of 
competition,  either  unilateral  (abuses  of  unilateral  dominant  position)  or 
multilateral  (abuses  of  collective  dominant  positions  and  restrictive 
agreements between companies).  

Without prejudice to the above, should the European Commission consider it 
necessary to introduce such ex ante new competition tool, we would suggest 
that authorities have quite limited powers when using such tool. Such powers 
could include issuing recommendations to companies, trade associations and 
governments on measures which would be appropriate to adopt in order to 
minimize the risk of foreclosure or distortion of competition in specific markets 
as  a  result  of  some  structural  problems.  These  recommendations  could 
propose measures to ensure fair competition between players and welfare of 
consumers.

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

By  contrast,  respondents  believe  that  the  imposition  of  structural  or 
behavioural  remedies  to  companies  by  and  administrative  authority  should 
definitely not be included as part of the powers of authorities using such new 
tool,  much  less  if  i)  there  is  an  ex  ante  sector  specific  regulation  imposing 
clear  obligations 
the  competitive 
to  companies  aimed  at  protecting 
environment and ii) remedies are imposed by public authorities whenever an 
infringement of the rules (competition or the said ex-ante sectorial regulation) 
is identified, on a particular case.  

From  the  legal  point  of  view,  the  power  to  impose  specific  remedies  to 
companies represents an administrative intervention which can significantly 
limit companies’ freedom of behaviour in the market. Legal certainty implies 
the right of companies to know which are the strict and exact limits to their 
behaviour in the market. From an economic point of view, over-enforcement 
could disincentive new business models before they reach the point at which 
efficiencies  are  generated,  while  the  accumulation  of  market  power  can  be 
tackled  by  means  of  Competition  Law  or  regulation  at  a  later  stage  where 
harm to welfare is to manifest itself. 

31.  Do  you  consider  that  in  order  to  address  the  aforementioned 
structural  competition  problems,  the  Commission  should  be  able  to 
impose appropriate and proportionate remedies on companies? If yes, 
which? 

•  Non-structural  remedies  (such  as  obligation  to  abstain  from  certain 
commercial behaviour): No. 

•  Structural  remedies  (for  instance,  divestitures  or  granting  access  to 
key infrastructure or inputs): No. 

•  Hybrid remedies (containing different types of obligations and bans): 
No.

N/A 

32.1. Please explain your answer. 

As explained in our answer to question 30 and 30.1, we understand it would 
not be reasonable nor appropriate that the European Commission might be 
able  to  impose  any  sort  of  remedies  –  either  behavioral  or  structural  – 
whenever applying a possible new ex ante competition tool, with no clear rules 
known by companies as to the limits of their behavior in the market. We have 
highlighted above the unintended consequences that these may bring about 
from both the legal and economic points of view. 

Compulsory divestment of a business is a very serious matter, which limits 
the  development  of  economic  activity  of  any  company  in  a  free  market 
economy, from the legal point of view, and may affect their incentives, from 
the economic point of view. We understand that such a measure should only 
be imposed on the basis of very clear and objective rules previously known 
by companies, e.g. in cases where a company has  incurred in very serious 
infringement  of  competition  law  in  the  market  (e.g.  abusing  its  dominant 
position).  The 
to  strict 
proportionality limits and is the “last resort” when applying Articles 101 or 102 
TFEU. Allowing a similar intrusive measure via “enforcement”, not agreed with 
the company (for instance, some recent commitment cases under Article 9 of 
Regulation  1/2003  include  this  type  of  remedies)  and  with  no  previous 
infringement,  would  be  unjustified  and  will  face  serious  legal  and  even 
constitutional problems.  

imposition  of  structural  remedies 

is  subject 

Structural remedies have also been imposed in cases where a new merger 
threatens the maintenance of effective competition in any market. In merger 
cases, divestment remedies can either be offered to competition authorities 
by merging companies themselves – which is a legitimate decision made by 
a  company  – or they can  be  imposed  by the  authorities,  in  which  case  the 
company has the right to decline and stop its merger project. 

Most  of  our  members  understand  that  a  competition  new  tool  which  could 
impose structural remedies such as compulsory divestment of business to any 
company which has not infringed any rules would threaten the principles of 
legal  certainty  and  free  economy  and  risk  affecting  disproportionately 
economic  incentives  to  develop  potentially  welfare-enhancing  business 
models. If the Commission finally decides to include it, it should establish strict 
proportionality  tests  and  also  ensure  that  all  the  procedural  guarantees  of 
Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are respected (including hearings, evidence and 
judicial review). 

E. Institutional set-up of a new competition tool

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

Section E of the questionnaire bears the heading ‘Institutional set-up of a new 
competition tool’. However, none of its questions (33 to 39) seek any views 
on the institutional framework that would apply this mechanism, as if it should 
be obvious that the Commission should be the sole enforcement authority. 

The respondents to this Questionnaire would like to stress that, in their view, 
the NCT can only be understood as an instrument for the public interest. As 
such, it lacks a clear definition of principles and rules, being more concerned 
with empowering agencies than on setting limits from the outset which would 
confine those powers to their intended aim. There is additionally little mention 
of  checks  and  balances.  It  is  expected  that  this  will  be  eventually  debated 
along the legislative process. 

In anticipation of that debate, we would suggest that the institutional scheme 
that would enforce the NCT should be open to the participation of Member 
States, including national competition agencies and national authorities with 
jurisdiction  on  digital  regulation  and  neighbouring  areas,  irrespective  of  the 
balance ultimately reached between the NCT and eventual ex-ante regulation. 
True, this should be weighed against the efficiency of the scheme; but this is 
too important not to consider it carefully. 

We address the specific questionnaire below.  

* 33. Do you consider that enforcement of the new competition tool by 
the Commission would require adequate and appropriate investigative 
powers in order to be effective? 

Yes. 

33.1. Please explain your answer. 

If  there  is  to  be  a  new  competition  tool  to  be  managed  by  the  European 
Commission  (please  see  above,  answer  to  question  11,  Section  C),  there 
need  be  rules governing  the  exercise  by  the  Commission  of  the  necessary 
enforcement powers under Article 103 TFEU. It is apparent that Regulation 
1/2003  would  not  automatically  apply,  as  these  powers  may  not  fall  strictly 
under  Articles  101/102  TFEU,  which  define  its  scope,  and  therefore  a  new 
vehicle  would  be  needed.  This  new  vehicle  should  ensure  that  the  parties’ 
rights  of defence  and their  right to  appeal the  decisions  are  preserved  in a 
way similar to Regulation 1/2003, with a fair contradictory procedure, proper 
investigation, statement of objections/conclusions, monitoring systems, etc.

In contrast with other industrial or economic sectors, the amount and quality 
of  publicly  available  information  is  limited  and  quickly  degrades.  In  many 
cases, only market players have the information that is needed to understand 
what is happening. And they have little incentives to share that. 

There are probably acceptable and questionable reasons for this. A part of 
the  information  is  extraordinarily  sensitive.  In  other  cases,  not  even  the 
players themselves have a clear use for data they retain but guess it could 
develop into something of value. Discussing their projects is difficult from a 
PR  standpoint.  There  is  a  clear  need  for  mechanisms  to  break  those 
resistances.

Questionnaire for a public consultation on a New Competition Tool 

At the same time, and partly for the same reasons, careful balancing in the 
intervention is essential. Forcing companies to cooperate, including through 
interviews with their management, are likely to be necessary. Dawn raids are 
unlikely  to  provide  value  and  would  most  probably  disrupt  the  necessary 
dialogue. 

This dialogue might be reinforced with mechanisms ensuring constant access 
to data and projects as well as regular reporting. This can be enforced under 
general information access mechanisms and therefore no additional specific 
tools are advised at this stage. 

As regards the powers to request information and to interview management 
and personnel, the respondents to this Questionnaire consider that the NCT 
should be somehow flexible in relation in particular to the length of the time 
periods granted for the companies to respond to RFIs. On the one hand, we 
understand the amount of data, not only in digital sectors/markets may be very 
significant  and  difficult 
the 
Commission’s potential questions within the tight deadlines typically imposed 
by the Commission in the context of Regulation 1/2003 and the EUMR; on the 
other  hand,  while  there  might  be  structural  competition  problems  as  the 
Commission  points  out,  the  NCT  will  not  lead  to  the  establishment  of  an 
infringement or the imposition of fines (according to question 25 of the present 
questionnaire) and, therefore,  this  is not  a  situation  comparable  to  those  in 
which the Commission sends RFIs in the context of infringement proceedings.

binding legal deadlines? 

No. 

34.1.  Please  explain your answer,  including the  resulting benefits  and 
drawbacks. If you replied yes, please specify the type of deadlines. 

It is understood that the question refers to binding deadlines for the agencies, 
like  those  under  Regulation  1/2003  and  the  EUMR.  That  is  likely  to  be 
counterproductive. The logic behind a deadline-based procedure is to return 
to  a  ‘clearance’  base  situation  soon.  If  adopted,  the  new  competition  tool 
should rather operate as a constant monitoring of digital markets, without any 
haste in terminating any specific procedure.  

It is on the other hand understood that deadlines to respond to questions or 
provide  information  would  be  needed,  without  prejudice  to  the  flexibility 
pointed out in the response to question 33.3 above.

35.  Do  you consider that the  new  competition  tool  should include  the 
possibility to impose interim measures in order to pre-empt irreparable 
harm? 

No.  

35.1. Please explain your answer. 

Respondents  are  concerned  about  the  possibility  of  imposing  interim 
measures  given  the  risk  that  such  measures  would  disrupt  the  companies’ 
business model and cause irreparable harm or at least an unjustified harm to 
entities  not  having  found  liable  of  any  infringement,  particularly  if  such 
measures are adopted by an authority whose powers would not be limited by 
law.  

It is worth noting that despite the questionnaire using a term known in law for 
years, these measures would be fundamentally different from the provisional, 
conservatory measures that are known and used in infringement proceedings, 
which require not only an imminent risk of irreparable harm, but also an initial 
finding  of  contradiction  with  the  law  (the  so-called  fumus  boni  iuris).  In 
contrast, the interim measures here considered would, by implication, require 
only  a  risk  of  irreparable  harm,  as  by  definition  the  conduct  would  not  be 
illegal. This makes these initiatives quite dangerous, as the authority would 
not  act  upon  limits  set  by  law  and  its  actions  would  constitute  a  severe 
interference  in  the  right  of  freedom  of  enterprise,  property  and  could  also 
cause an unjustified harm to perfectly legal business models.  

In these circumstances, respondents believe that it would be safer to maintain 
the possibility of interim measures for cases of clear infringements of Articles 
101  and  102  TFUE,  where  the  rights  of  defense  and  necessity  of  the 
measures would be considered.  

In the event these new set of “interim measures” were accepted, against the 
opinion  here  expressed,  the  procedure  should  definitely  provide  for  a  fully 
contradictory procedure for the affected parties and also before the European 
Courts in order to minimize the risk of false positives.

36.  Do  you consider that the  new  competition  tool  should include  the 
possibility  to  accept  voluntary  commitments  by  the  companies 
operating 
identified  and 
demonstrated structural competition problems? 

in  the  markets  concerned  to  address 

Yes. 

36.1. Please explain your answer. 

The  question,  as  formulated,  is  confusing.  The  NCT  should  indeed  make 
provision  for a  dialogue  with  the  undertakings  operating  in  the  market  (it  is 
unclear if  the  term  ‘companies’  is used  in  that  sense).  As  in other areas  of 
competition  law,  commitments  should  be  preferred  to  unilaterally  imposed 
remedies. However, the reference to ‘voluntary’ is misleading in this context 
(there  is  hardly  anything  voluntary  in  receiving  an  invitation  from  an 
enforcement  authority).  Leaving 
their  presentation  as 
“commitments”  appears  to  suggest  an  analogy  with  commitments  under 
article  9  of  Regulation  1/2003.  That  identification  would  be  misplaced,  as 
Article 9 concerns a way to avoid an infringement decision, not an amendment 
to an (initially legal) commitment initiative. That fundamental distinction would 
make  it  necessary  to  ensure  that  these  measures  are  fully  reviewable.  For 
total clarity – undertakings should have the right to question their ‘voluntary’ 
commitments before the European Courts as well as have the possibility of 
adapt  such  commitments  if  the  change  of  circumstances  render  them 
disproportionate.

37.  Do  you  consider  that  during  the  proceedings  the  companies 
operating  in  the  markets  concerned,  or  suppliers  and  customers  of 
those  companies  should  have  the  possibility  to  comment  on  the 
findings of the existence of a structural competition problem before the 
final decision? 

 Yes. 

 37.1. Please explain your answer. 

It is understood that the question refers to ‘market testing’. If so, that is a most 
useful  mechanism  that  should  be  standard,  not  only  to  comment  on  the 
findings but also on the appropriateness of any solutions or remedies. 

38.  Do  you  consider  that  during  the  proceedings  the  companies 
operating  in  the  markets  concerned,  or  suppliers  and  customers  of 
those  companies  should  have  the  possibility  to  comment  on  the 
appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies?

No, as respondents understand that, if adopted, the new instrument should 
not allow for the imposition of remedies. 

38.1. Please explain your answer. 

Please see the response to question 37.1 above. 

39. Do you consider that the new competition tool should be subject to 
adequate procedural safeguards, including judicial review? 

Yes. 

39.1. Please explain your answer. 

The NCT arguably needs stronger standards than when enforcing Articles 101 
and  102  TFEU.  The  reasons  are  many:  lack  of  defined  standards,  risk  of 
interference with economic freedoms, risk of stifling technical and economic 
development, etc. In order to minimise enforcement errors (type I or II) hearing 
all  interested  parties  in  candidness  will  be  essential,  again  arguably  even 
more than with the classic prohibitions. 

This should result in a close examination of the necessity and proportionality 
of  any  eventual  commitments,  even  where  offered  by  market  players 
themselves. The logic of the Alrosa case-law (essentially, that parties are free 
to propose commitments that the authority may not need to justify as adequate 
or proportionate) is understood in an infringement setting, but should not be 
followed in connection with the NCT: any and all remedies should be justified 
as  necessary  and  proportionate,  and  it  should  be  possible  to  seek 
confirmation by the Courts that this is the case.
