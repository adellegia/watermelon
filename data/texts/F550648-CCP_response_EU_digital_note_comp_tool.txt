The Centre for Competition Policy (CCP) 

CCP  is  an  independent  research  centre  established  in  2004.  CCP’s  research  programme  explores 
competition  policy  and  regulation  from  the  perspective  of  economics,  law,  business  and  political 
science.  CCP  has  close  links  with,  but  is  independent  of,  regulatory  authorities  and  private  sector 
practitioners.  The  Centre  produces  a  regular  series  of  Working  Papers,  policy  briefings  and 
publications. An e-bulletin keeps academics and practitioners in touch with publications and events, 
and a lively programme of conferences, workshops and practitioner seminars takes place throughout 
the year. Further information about CCP is available at our website: www.competitionpolicy.ac.uk

Additional CCP comments: EU consultation on New Digital Tool and New 
Digital Regulation. 

In light of the nature of the possible changes in EU legislation and potential new regulatory 

structure, and the stated indication that there might not be a second opportunity for open 

comment, the UEA’s Centre for Competition Policy provides the following observations. These 

draw  out  key  points  for  which  we  did  not  feel  able  to  express  responsive  points  in  the 

questionnaire  format.  We  note  also  a  recent  2020  paper  by  Amelia  Fletcher  “Market 

Investigations  for  Digital  Platforms:  Panacea  or  Complement?”  (attached  and  available  at 

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3668289)  and  another  by  Elias 

Deutscher (attached). 

The Centre for Competition Policy is a leading inter-disciplinary research centre focused on 

competition and regulation based at the University of East Anglia. This response was prepared 

by Andrea Calef, Elias Deutscher, Sean Ennis, Amelia Fletcher and Bruce Lyons, though not all 

views are attributable to each person. 

We proceed with comments by theme, with an emphasis on brevity and focus, and without 

suggesting that these points provide a complete coverage of important topics: 

Structure,  location  and  funding  of  body  for  new  competition  tool.  DG  Competition,  as 

currently  constituted,  is mainly  set  up  for  casework.  Although  it  has performed  occasional 

market studies, any addition of responsibilities to the European Commission, such as those 

outlined, would require that the body handling those powers (if pre-existing) would receive 

an additional budget sufficient to ensure that balanced and procedurally fair conclusions can 

be  drawn.  This  issue  is  particularly  relevant  if  remedies  need  ongoing  monitoring.  If  the 

competition tool and digital regulation go to one or more existing DGs, then the budget of the 

DG(s) would need to be raised concomitantly. We note that often the funding of competition 

authority work may come from general taxation (though there are exceptions within the EU, 

such as in Greece) while regulators are very often financed by a levy from the industry they 

oversee, given that the focus is so much more specific on a limited area of economic activity. 

To  the  extent  that  these  powers  focus  very  much  on  one  sector,  the  question  of  how  to 

finance their application is relevant.

Remedies.  With  the  described  powers  in  hand,  it  will  be  important  to  devise  checks  and 

balances to aid in resisting the temptation to enter directly into structural remedies when 

behavioural  remedies  are  possible.  Demand  side  remedies  can  be  valuable  in  many 

circumstances, particularly when structural remedies are inappropriate; for example, in the 

presence  of  strong  network  externalities  or  when  consumer  behaviour  results  in  lack  of 

competition  despite  an  apparently  competitive  market  structure.1  When  designing  such 

remedies, it is important to consider how consumers really behave, with a particular focus on 

relative salience and relative consumer engagement.2 Moreover, intuitively sensible remedies 

may sometimes have unexpected effects, as might occur with price disclosure requirements.3 

When remedies are adopted, there needs to be an appropriate body (e.g. DG) that has the 

capacity for on-going monitoring and review.   

Coordination. Coordination between EC and EU national regulators will be important, as well 

as coordination between regulators and competition authorities. The governance challenges 

and  benefits  from  coordination  between  sector  and  competition  authority  regulators  are 

described  in  Ennis  (2019)  which  includes  a  discussion  of  the  merits  and  disadvantages  of 

combining  regulators  and  competition  authorities.4  It  will  be  particularly  valuable  to  find 

appropriate  mechanisms  for  sharing  confidential  information  from  investigations  and 

ensuring  that  comparable  information  is  provided  to  different  authorities  with  legitimate 

interest and with powers that enable gathering and sharing the type of information shared. 

In particular for digital companies, information needed in one jurisdiction may commonly be 

found  in  another.  The  signing  on  2  September  2020  of  the  Mutual  Assistance  and  Co-

operation Framework for Competition between five competition authorities outside the EU 

is a positive development and it may be useful for the EU to take those steps necessary to 

ensure it has access to relevant confidential information wherever it may be held in the world.

In addition to the new mutual assistance framework, examples of ways to share information, 

investigative and decision-making powers include: 

-European Competition Network; 

-Dual  powers  in  the  UK  between  the  competition  authority  and  regulators 

(concurrency). We note that in the UK, if CMA writes a report, it may send the 

design of remedy to the regulator or monitoring to the regulator. 

We  note  in  particular  that  it  may  be  worth  looking  to  experience  with  other  domains  of 

regulation. For example, the experience of cooperation in the Single Supervisory Mechanism 

(SSM) at ECB may illustrate alternative mechanisms for ensuring that activities are overseen 

both at national and ECB level. We note that DG Competition may not have the direct pseudo-

legislative power of the SSM at the ECB (even if that power is not used by the ECB). 

One of the authors of this note believes that even if cross-jurisdiction mandatory coordination 

is possible, differentiated enforcement across geographies can permit comparative studies to 

help  determine  which  policy  options  are  most  effective,  which  may  be  valuable  if  the 

corporate  cost  from  implementing  different  local  versions  of  their  product  is  moderate. 

Uniform and coordinated action can make such evaluation more difficult. But such evaluation 

is  particularly  important  in  a  context  in  which  unexpected  regulatory  consequences  are 

possible and the evidence base for specific regulatory approaches is somewhat limited.5  

Monitoring  and  subsidiarity.  As  already  pointed  out,  the  monitoring  of  commitments  by 

private companies on their behaviour may be a major future activity. For monitoring elements 

on  the  demand  side,  related  to  perceived  retail  activity,  national  authorities  may  be  well-

suited  to  such  monitoring.  On  the  other  hand,  monitoring  of  behaviour  behind  the  retail-

customer interface (including business customers) may involve examination of algorithms or 

examinations  of  multi-country  related  business  documents.  In  some  respects,  this  type  of 

monitoring  may  be  particularly  well-suited  to  a  large  authority  with  multi-country 

competence, suggesting some monitoring may be best performed by the EC.

Checks and balances. We note that the UK government has given UK competition authority 

strong powers that amount to quasi-legislative authority around market investigations (e.g. 

break-up or price regulation of firms that have not broken any law). Giving such authority to 

an entity in the European Union context may be more of a political concern than it is in the 

UK. 

Powers.  The  distribution  of  powers  would  an  important  aspect  of  forthcoming  legislation, 

considering whether member states would be required to set up a comparable digital tool 

and regulatory apparatus to that at the European Union level, on the one extreme, or having 

the  powers  for  review  handled  exclusively  at  the  central  level.  In  the  energy,  sector,  for 

example, EU policies tend to be operationalised via the mechanism of national regulators. 

While it might be unwise to require putting in place of such regulation in all member states, 

given the limited size and budget of smaller states and complexity of the digital field at the 

moment, there may be benefits that come from regulatory diversity that ultimately allows for 

a better assessment of alternative policy options at the EU level.  

When comparable powers exist at Member State and EU level, a mechanism is needed to 

prevent inconsistent outcomes. We note that, while the UK had market investigation powers 

that  could  potentially  overlap  with  those  of  the  EC,  no  UK  market  investigations  are 

performed in areas that would potentially intervene with EC competences.  

Limiting focus to digital.  Moreover, there is a risk that if new powers are justified for digital 

purposes, but are actually much broader, they will then be used later for purposes beyond 

the  initially  envisioned  legislative  remit,  and  that  they  could  be  used  for  broader  political 

intervention in corporate structuring. However, it will be increasingly difficult to distinguish 

separate digital and non-digital markets as transactions move online and consumer durables 

become  part  of  the  ‘internet  of  things’.  Placing  the  powers  within  DG  Competition  would 

ensure that other investigations can take priority over  a given market study (e.g., cartel or 

abuse  of  dominance),  both  limiting  scope  of  market  studies  and  ensuring  that  market 

investigations are not stopping enforcement against otherwise illegal acts for which classic 

competition law enforcement would be the preferred outcome.
