Deliveroo’s response to the New Competition Tool consultation  

Summary  

1. We welcome the opportunity to respond to the EU’s consultation on the New
Competition Tool. It is important that technology and the regulatory landscape within
the European Union continue to drive innovation and improved outcomes for
consumers, businesses and citizens alike. We agree it is important to ensure “fair
and undistorted competition in the internal market,” as the NCT Roadmap sets out.   

2.

3.

4.

However,
the online food delivery market is highly competitive and the risks to
competition the European Commission (EC) are concerned with do not arise in this
sector. Increased regulation of this sector would make it less dynamic because
players are likely to refrain from competing and innovating if new regulation makes it
too difficult to do so. This would result in a negative impact on competition.  

Any legislative changes the EC chooses to implement need to protect the high levels
of competition and innovation that exist in the online food delivery sector. 

It is essential the EC develops clear standards setting out when it will launch an NCT
study and detailing when intervention would be justified.  

5. We have serious concerns around the NCT proposal where it would enable the EC to
be able to intervene and impose remedies before any infringement of competition
rules actually occurs. If the EC is intent on pursuing the introduction of an NCT there
are some key considerations we would highlight. These include the need for clear
criteria around what would be required to trigger an investigation under the NCT and
a set of guidelines for any application of remedies or enforcement action.

self-employed riders and 100,000 restaurants across over 500 towns and cities
globally.
As of 2019, 59,000 additional jobs have been created by Deliveroo in the
restaurant sectors in the markets in which we operate. We operate across 12
markets globally, of which 6 are in the EU: France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Ireland.  

8. We work with independent, self-employed riders who have the freedom to choose if,
when, where and for how long they work, who are free to reject deliveries offered to
them, work with several businesses at once, and appoint substitutes to conduct
services on their behalf.  

9.

10.

Having the freedom to choose when and where you work, cancel or finish at any
point is ideally suited to people who have other commitments; for example a student
who wants to change their plans on a weekly basis depending on their coursework,
or someone who wants to make some top-up income for a few weeks to save up for
a special occasion. 

For our restaurant partners, we provide an opportunity to reach new customers,
increase revenues and improve profitability. A major study by Capital Economics, an
independent economic consultancy,
revealed in 2019 the significant benefits
Deliveroo brings to the restaurant industry in Europe. The study shows that, as of
2019, Deliveroo supported the generation of €2.25bn in revenue in the European
economy, which has helped to create over 46,000 additional jobs in the European
restaurant sector.  

Recent challenges faced through COVID-19 outbreak. 

11.

12.

13.

The restaurant sector has been one of the hardest hit during the recent outbreak of 
COVID-19. While Deliveroo has been a valuable service for the restaurant sector in 
normal times, it has become an even more important service for restaurants and 
customers alike in recent months.  

During the COVID-19 crisis, platforms like Deliveroo have been a lifeline for 
restaurants in Europe, with delivery becoming 
industry during the national lockdowns. Thanks to Deliveroo, restaurants have 
reached customers they would not otherwise have reached and as a result, our 
partners have been able to keep a certain degree of economic activity to maintain 
jobs and to avoid closure. 

the only source of income for the 

The crisis has also highlighted the symbiotic relationship between Deliveroo and the 
restaurants on our platform. At the height of the crisis, many restaurants chose to 
close entirely, which had a significant negative impact on the selection of restaurants 
available to customers and, as a direct consequence, saw a reduction in the sales 
made over our platform. We want our restaurant partners to succeed, which was 
underlined by the actions we took during the outbreak and associated lockdowns.

To help restaurants struggling with cash flow, we brought
forward the normal
payment cycle so that restaurants could receive their payments on a daily/weekly
basis. To ensure restaurant staff were protected during the crisis, and to give
consumers confidence that delivery is safe, we initiated contactless delivery
handovers with riders to minimise the risk of contagion. We invested in marketing
campaigns, aimed at boosting customer sales for local, independent restaurants and
we introduced a new feature in our app allowing consumers to round up their order
and provide tips which go directly to restaurants. We also invested in new tools to
enable customers to return to restaurants for dine-in, when regulations allowed. 

Just as we take our responsibilities to restaurant partners seriously, so we take our
responsibilities to the self-employed riders who work with us seriously as well. All our
riders are covered by accident and injury insurance. We also took steps to protect
riders during the COVID-19 outbreak. As mentioned above, we quickly initiated a
new contactless delivery process to minimise interaction between riders, restaurant
staff and customers. We set up a Rider Hardship Fund, ensuring riders had access to
financial support if they were ill through Covid or were forced to self-isolate by a
medical authority. We have also sent regular communications to riders, advising
them on the latest government information and advice to keep safe, and distributed
masks and sanitiser.  

For consumers too, Deliveroo has played an important social role since its creation, 
which has been strengthened during the crisis, bringing food to vulnerable and 
isolated people in their homes, initiating campaigns and donations to hospital staff 
and those in need. Deliveroo has also adapted its offer and its operations to cater for 
changing consumer needs during the crisis, making sure the highest levels of safety 
were adhered to and by ensuring essential foods were available, for example by 
starting to work with supermarkets to ensure food could be delivered to those who 
were self-isolating.  

The online food delivery sector  

17.

The online food delivery sector is highly competitive. As a result it does not give rise
to the risks to competition the EC is concerned with. 

Limited economies of scale advantages  

18.

There are inherent limitations in the food delivery logistics model which significantly
inhibits Deliveroo from scaling quickly at
low cost. This means that scaling up
involves taking on more costs - and so there are limited scale efficiencies that could
disadvantage smaller players. These limitations can be summarised as follows:  

● Inherent Costs:

 Deliveroo scales by increasing orders, increasing restaurant 
selection and having a rider network that can fulfil all orders, whilst taking into 
account the nuances of each geographical location. Deliveroo has to spend 
money to achieve sca
le in each of the markets in which it operates. This is in 
contrast to other online market players where there are zero marginal costs to 
scaling (e.g. Facebook acquiring new users).

● Efficiencies 

are Capped:

 There is a ceiling as to how efficient Deliveroo’s 
rider network can become through scale.This is because Deliveroo delivers 
highly perishable food meaning it must be delivered to customers quickly (i.e. 
under 30 minutes) to retain its quality. Further, there are only so many orders 
a rider can physically deliver within any given hour. This feature of Deliveroo’s 
point to point logistics model prevents Deliveroo from (for example) holding 
back cooked orders to collate them for delivery in either a single bulk drop or 
multiple drops via a more efficient route. This is in contrast to the efficiencies 
that can be achieved through scale by other online market players who 
operate a travelling salesman model.  

Limited network effects 

19.

20.

Unlike some other online platforms, food delivery platforms’ ability to benefit from
network effects are limited by the physical nature of the service we offer. The
distinction between different platforms’ business models needs to be considered
when determining policy in this area. At Deliveroo, we aim to deliver food within 30
minutes of ordering. This means our operation is necessarily local - we will only ever
display a limited number of restaurants to a limited number of customers within an
approximate 30 minute delivery time radius. This means any potential benefit from
network effects will always be capped. 

Having lots of restaurants in Paris, for example, will not attract a customer in Madrid
to place a purchase over our platform. Even within a country, the same holds true.
The availability of riders in Milan will not help to deliver a customer’s order on time in
Rome. Similarly, riders will not be incentivised to log into the app in Rome if there is a
surge in orders and higher delivery fees offered in Milan. 

21. We cannot benefit from large network effects in the way platforms will be able to
when the service is not physical (e.g. services provided solely over the internet, like
Facebook and Google), or where the delivery of an item sold over a platform is not
time sensitive (e.g. Amazon, where goods can be shipped over a much longer
delivery time than 30 minutes). 

Limited ability to scale data advantages 

22.

Deliveroo’s business is to deliver food from point A to point B quickly, while giving
customers accurate estimates of delivery times upon which they can rely when
determining the restaurant from which they wish to order. We must dispatch riders to
deliver orders in the most efficient manner possible, factoring in: 

A. How long the food will take to be prepared by the restaurant;  
B. The rider’s location (which is constantly changing) and mode of transport; 
C. The rider’s likelihood of accepting an order (self employed riders are free to

accept/reject orders when they like);

D. The distance and likely route between the rider and the restaurant, and

1
therefore the likely travel time;   

E. The likely wait time at the restaurant (which will vary by restaurant, time of

day, day of the week, etc.); 

F. The distance and likely route between the restaurant and the customer (and
also whether the customer is in a house or a block of flats, which will affect
delivery times); and 

G. All the other live and predicted orders in the system, i.e. what might be most
efficient for one order will not be most efficient when all orders are considered
together. Solving the operational challenge of delivering food from one point
to another is hard enough for one order, but determining what is best for all
orders introduces a 

 degree of complexity. 

high

23.

Our algorithm will calculate all the above, but will produce varying estimations which
will differ from country to country depending on (for example); the infrastructure of a
city (roads, buildings), weather, preferred vehicle types and traffic; local laws and the
prevalence of multi-apping amongst riders; the relative split between take-away and
dine-in orders for restaurants; and the prevalent cuisine types and associated food
preparation time in different markets. Usable insights from the data are not easily
transferable between countries and it is therefore difficult for Deliveroo to leverage
such data to launch, scale and improve its operations in other countries. 

Several strong players in each market 

24.

As we strive to provide a better service we innovate on all three sides of the
marketplace to compete against other companies in our sector. This competition
ensures that all sides of the marketplace are provided with an ever improving service
level. In all the European markets in which we operate, we face fierce competition
from at least 2 other players: 

UK: Just Eat, Uber Eats 
IE: Just Eat, Uber Eats  
FR: Just Eat, Uber Eats 
ES: Just Eat, Uber Eats, Glovo 
IT: Just Eat, Uber Eats, Glovo 
, Uber Eats 
BE: 
, Uber Eats 
NL: 

Takeaway.com
Takeaway.com

25.

There are also smaller players in each of the European markets in which we operate,
eg. Foodhub, Easyfood and Tastecard (launching in September 2020) in the UK. 

Widespread multihoming 

1 Deliveroo even factors in the length of the street when determining the likely travel time between the rider and the restaurant
and between the restaurant and customer (with bikes being quicker than scooters where the streets are shorter in length).

27.

The barriers to switching service provider in the food delivery industry are very low.
This encourages multi-homing amongst all
three sides of our marketplace;
customers, restaurants and riders. 

2

Customers will use multiple apps simultaneously, typically driven by which app has
a customer’s favourite restaurant In 2019, 47% of consumers on Deliveroo also used
UberEats, and 42% also used Just Eat . The effort required to download a new app
there are no costs associated with downloading an additional food
is minimal,
delivery app, and the benefits of customer loyalty (i.e. ordering from the same app
repeatedly) are minimal too. This demonstrates the absence of any consumer lock-in
effects which when present, as the NCT Roadmap suggests, are often associated
with a gatekeeper position and are a typical characteristic of structural competition
problems. But because customers can easily switch between service providers, all
food delivery platforms are forced to constantly compete on price, service levels (i.e.
providing accurate delivery times, ensuring food is delivered as quickly as possible
and arrives hot), and selection of restaurants. 

28.

Restaurants often work with multiple online food delivery players and many refuse to
list exclusively with one platform . This preference to multi-home demonstrates the
absence of any lock-in effect which, as cited in the NCT Roadmap, when present is
often associated with structural competition problems.  

3

29. While restaurants have always listed on multiple platforms, we saw an increase in
this trend during the COVID-19, with restaurants ending exclusivity arrangements
and choosing instead to maximise the number of platforms on which they listed in
order to increase the number of customers they were able to reach. This trend is
likely to increase as the sector continues to recover from the recent difficulties faced
during the pandemic.  

30.

Riders who work with Deliveroo are all self-employed contractors. The same is true
of those who work with most online delivery platforms within the EU. Because they
are self-employed, riders are free to work with multiple businesses at the same time.
This could be different types of courier service companies as well as other online
food delivery companies. As the contract makes clear, ‘throughout the term of [the]
Agreement [riders] are free to work for any other party including competitors of
Deliveroo’. Riders are also entirely free to reject deliveries which are offered to them.
Many riders will be logged into multiple platforms simultaneously, meaning we must
ensure we offer an attractive fee to riders. If we do not, they are likely to accept a
more attractive offer from one of our competitors. Again, barriers to multi-homing for
this side of the marketplace are incredibly low. 

2 Source: AppAnnie 
3  Third party reports, like “The Sift Report 2020” largely corroborate these figures. On Page 18, for 
example, it states of “More brands are increasing the number of platforms they use also, with two 
fifths that offer delivery now partnering with more than one third-party delivery operator”.

31.

Deliveroo not only competes with other online food delivery platforms, but also
vertically integrated chains, who take orders directly from customers, and directly
over a restaurant’s own website (often for collection as opposed to delivery).
Because of multi-homing, and the fact that many restaurants can sell directly to
customers who live locally themselves, Deliveroo and others in the area have to
compete vigorously to offer the best proposition. We do not have gatekeeper power
because these restaurants and take-away outlets have always traditionally served
customers who live locally and can continue to do so and forego online sales if they
believe the benefits are insufficient and they are not being offered competitive and
fair commercial terms. 

32. Multi-homing is common, easy and there are no barriers whatsoever preventing
customers, restaurants or riders switching between platforms. This means Deliveroo
must compete vigorously to offer the best proposition to customers, restaurants and
riders.  

Highly competitive sector 

33.

The EC is concerned with tackling structural competition problems which, as it sets
out, can result in inefficient market outcomes like higher prices, lower quality, less
choice and innovation. However, not every platform market is susceptible to the kind
of competition concerns the EC is focused on. As demonstrated above, the online
food delivery sector is highly competitive and these characteristics do not arise.  

34.

Online food delivery platforms have: 

(i) limited economies of scale advantages; 
(ii) limited network effects; 
(iii) limited ability to scale data advantages; 
(iv) several strong players in each market and  
(v) 

widespread multihoming.  

35.

The COVID-19 crisis has emphasised how important each side of our three-sided
marketplace is to the success of the other, and ultimately to Deliveroo. But this is a
reality which has always been self-evident to us. For Deliveroo to succeed, we need
to attract and retain customers,
restaurants and riders. We face significant
competition on each side of our marketplace, which forces us to constantly innovate
and improve our offering to each group. We know each side of the marketplace cares
about different things: 

● Customers 
● Restaurants care about sales, margins and forming a partnership with

care about price, service and selection. 

Deliveroo via B2B tools.  

● Riders 

care about pay, flexibility and benefits.  

36.

other digital sectors. The variation in levels of competition between different
industries and sectors demonstrates that not all digital markets require additional
regulation.

The EC proposes to use the NCT to address a) structural risks for competition and b)
a structural lack of competition. The characteristics associated with a) structural risks
for competition such as extreme economies of scale, strong network effects and data
dependency do not apply to the online restaurant food delivery sector. In addition, the
characteristics associated with b) a structural
lack of competition such as high
concentration and entry barriers, consumer lock in and data accumulation do not
apply to our sector. 

Key considerations for the European Commission 

Any intervention and possible remedies must be proportionate, targeted and precise

Regulation should be applied where necessary to solve a problem, but should not be
used where there is no problem to solve. The NCT would allow the EC to intervene
and impose remedies before any infringement of competition rules actually occurs.
This raises serious concern. The need for proportional action cannot be overstated.
We believe proposed intervention and remedies should focus on addressing actual
distortion of competition based on evidence rather than theoretical and speculative
risks to competition. Intervening in already competitive markets like the online food
delivery sector would risk dampening competition and slowing innovation, to the
detriment of consumers, restaurants and riders. We strongly believe intervention
must protect and strengthen competition and that enforcement action should be
limited to businesses which are clearly undermining competition and unfairly treating
users of their platform.  

In order for the NCT to be a legitimate and effective mechanism it will be necessary
to outline when the use of the tool would be appropriate and why the application of
existing competition law or an inquiry would not be sufficient. It is important that if
new powers are taken, these are well-targeted and used proportionately, only where
there are genuinely new problems which cannot be fixed through existing provisions.
We believe the rules need to be as tightly defined as possible to prevent an
overreach of intervention in instances where there are either no harms which need
addressing or where existing powers could be used instead.  

Enforcement powers that regulatory agencies have should be accompanied by a set
of criteria and guidelines required to trigger an investigation under the NCT and any
application of remedies or enforcement action. In addition, the EC will need to define
who may trigger intervention under the NCT. These guidelines should outline how the
EC will decide which remedies are appropriate and proportionate in different
scenarios.

In addition, there should be clear and transparent safeguarding measures in place to
protect stakeholders, maintain and ensure due process is followed through
appropriate checks and balances, and to ensure the rights of defence. The NCT
should facilitate companies to submit voluntary commitments at an early stage if they
desire. Given the potential powers to impose remedies and restructure markets, it is
important to have strong Court oversight for this process, enabled via swift access to
the European Courts. 

The EC’s NCT Roadmap states that the NCT proposal is complementary to the EC’s
new initiative on platform-specific ex-ante regulation. Given the significant chance of
overlap between these two mechanisms it is essential that the EC explains how both
tools will operate alongside each other. 

Gatekeepers

the framework of

The EC’s NCT Roadmap sets out
the structural competition
problems it is seeking to tackle in the context of the development of “gatekeepers.”
The Roadmap says, “The ensuing risks for competition can arise through the creation
of powerful market players with an entrenched market and/or gatekeeper position,
the emergence of which could be prevented by early intervention.” We note that the
EC’s parallel piece of work, on ex ante regulations, directly addresses the
development of so called “gatekeepers” and sets out a range of possible options to
regulate large online platforms benefitting from significant network effects and acting
as gate-keepers.  

Deliveroo is focused on being a specialist food company. We believe businesses
which focus on specific markets, and which do not leverage data from one market to
develop business in other markets, and which do not in turn bundle these services
together to form a proposition which customers or businesses would then find it
difficult to disentangle themselves, should not be considered ‘gatekeepers’ for the
purposes of the NCT and ex ante regulations. This is particularly true where the
market in which they operate is so competitive that no single business would be able
to dictate the commercial
institute unfair or
damaging practices without businesses choosing to take their services elsewhere. 

terms offered to businesses, nor

The data we hold cannot be leveraged easily in different countries as it is very
specific to the locality. It would be even more difficult for us to leverage this data to
develop activity in an adjacent market. 

Deliveroo clearly does not have a dominant position in the markets in which it
operates given the highly competitive nature of the sector. Our concern, therefore, is
that in looking to extend its definition of dominance to a looser ‘gatekeeper’ definition,
the EC may inadvertently capture platforms which are not dominant and which
operate in highly competitive markets. The work to encompass a definition of
gatekeeper is centered on the ex ante proposals. But inevitably the impact of any ex

ante regulations will have a direct impact on the application of any potential NCT
regulations, hence our desire to reiterate here that Deliveroo is not a gatekeeper. 

47. We believe the EC needs to carefully assess whether consumer and business choice
is limited in a market, either because one single business is significantly larger than
all others, or because the barriers to switching services and/or multi-homing are high.
Again, this is clearly not a situation which users of Deliveroo’s service find. 

48. We believe in defining the characteristics of a gatekeeper, the EC should consider

whether the business: 

○ Has a dominant position in at least one sector 
○ Is able to maintain its dominant position because barriers to multi-homing and

switching service provider are high  

○ Utilises its dominant position in one market, and the data gathered in the

process of establishing its dominance, to move into adjacent markets.  

Conclusion 

49.

50.

51.

The online food delivery market is highly competitive and the risks to competition the
EC are concerned with do not arise in this sector. Increased regulation of this sector
would make it less dynamic because players are likely to refrain from competing and
innovating if new regulation makes it too difficult to do so. This would result in a
negative impact on competition.  

The example of the online food delivery sector demonstrates that not all online
markets are likely to need the type of intervention being proposed through the NCT.  

It is essential the EC develops clear standards setting out when it will launch an NCT
study and detailing when intervention would be justified.
