ESC POSITION PAPER  
BLOCK EXEMPTION REGULATION 

The European Shippers’ Council represents the interests of more than 75.000 cargo owners in the 
European Union, both SMEs and large multinational companies. For all of them, transport is an 
indispensable link to their customers. Efficient and sustainable transport & logistics are therefore 
critical for the competitiveness of the European industry and the socio-economic welfare in Europe.  

ABSTRACT - KEY CONCEPTS OUTLINE 

§  None of the consortia are fully compliant with the current BER-criteria. 
§  Consortia market shares and relevant markets should be more clearly defined and monitored. 
§  Consortia and / or Alliance market power should bring responsibility and accountability. 
§  A mechanism for  transparent compliance procedures through regular reporting and independ-
ent  monitoring  of  market  disruptions,  should  be  put  in  place.  This  could  be  achieved  without 
neither modifying DG Comp’s mission nor draining its resources. 
If the requirements of shippers are not met, the entire BER should be revoked.

1.  BACKGROUND  

The Consortia BER has, since it was first adopted in 1995, established the relationship between 
carriers and their customers on the need to achieve maximal productivity and service improve-
ments. It has a major effect on the market and the relationship between suppliers & users as set 
out below. 

§  Market 
Regulation 246/2009 makes it clear that a fair share of the benefits and efficiencies gener-
ated by the BER should be passed onto shippers1. It sets out criteria that need to be met: 

- 
- 

Improvement in productivity benefitting the users of the shipping services.  
Improvement in frequency of sailings, port calls, scheduling and better qual-
ity of services. 

-  Other criteria which may be proof of benefits for users. 

As  demonstrated  by  the  shippers’  previous  fillings,    the  attached  complementary  infor-
mation (as an addendum to this document), and as supported by various official reports2 as 
well as other stakeholders’ data, the conclusion of last years market operations assessments 
is that the above criteria have generally not been met. 

During the past years, the market situation has - and is still – suffering from low service levels 
as evidenced by the publicly available statistics on blank sailings and the total lack of sched-
ule reliability. Also, the experience of many customers concerning unacceptably poor com-
munication and incident handling management by several carriers, reflects a regrettable ten-
dency mode of current supplier-customer relationship patterns. 

Shippers have been experiencing – and still do – a new configuration of freight costs, where 
surcharges3  have  been  frequently  used  as  an  instrument  to  cover  additional  costs  or  get 
around agreed contractual conditions. If sea freight rates have been reduced in average, this 
is mainly due to the massive injection of very large box ships into the fleets, which may have 
taken place anyway, even if no major alliance had been set. 

1 Council Regulation 246/2009, Recital 10 : In order to ensure that all the conditions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty are 
met, conditions should be attached to group exemptions to ensure in particular that a fair share of the benefits will be 
passed on to shippers and that competition is not eliminated.

The benefits, upon which the BER is conditional, have not been delivered by the consortia to 
the transport users. As a conclusion, we can say that the market is not performing properly 
due to the following points, considered to be a direct consequence of the BER: 

-  Very high concentration between competitor carriers on the two main trades 

to/from Europe. 

-  The resulting service uniformity. 
-  Uncertainty that requires further clarification: very few consortia are located 

within the scope of 30% threshold. 

The  purpose  of  the  BER  -  providing  legal  advantages  to  certain  categories  of  consortia  in 
order for them to achieve a level of integration of operations which would in turn allow them 
to be more efficient and share the resulting efficiency gains with their customers -  is there-
fore put in question by the operational background of the 3 major alliances. 

Although  clear  underperformance  has  been  evidenced,  it  cannot  be  fully  quantified  nor 
properly remedied because the objectives of the consortia, in terms of efficiency, have never 
been made public and are not transparent to other stakeholders, in particular, the carriers’ 
customers,  or  the  relevant  competition  authorities.  The  BER  presently  lacks  an  effective 
monitoring tool ensuring transparent compliance and allowing for an open verification of 
how the full benefits are actually passed onto the carriers’ customers.  

§  Stakeholders’ relationship 
Despite some service level performance information available by the industry or by neutral 
third parties on punctuality, reliability and freight rates, this information is neither sufficient 
to allow shippers to challenge the performance of their carriers nor to provide them with a 
good forecast of future liners schedules based on their past execution accomplishments. 

The absence of direct constructive communication between carriers and customers on the 
capacity, service level and performance of shipping companies also triggers a confusing/con-
flicting appreciation of the unsatisfactory situation root cause. Indeed, carriers invariably ex-
cuse their shortcomings by the impossibility to forecast demand and adapt to its fluctuations, 
and by a lack of shippers’ interest for tailor made/non-commodity type of services. End cus-
tomers perceive on their side a prevailing structural lack of resources in carriers’ organiza-
tions which prevents them to differentiate themselves on the non-sea faring part of their 
service. 

All in all, the absence of dialogue, evidenced by the lack of an asserting approach, is raising 
the frustrations and is negatively impacting on the economy on both sides.

On top of that, the present BER introduced an unbalanced legal treatment of alliances on 
the one hand, and alliance customers as well as the other stakeholders, on the other. For 
instance, the status of large alliances, as falling within or outside the scope of application of 
the BER and thus being exempted or not from the application of Article 101 (1) TFEU, remains 
unclear. This is not insignificant as the burden of proof of compliance or non-compliance to 
competition law shifts from one side to the other depending on such status.  

This resulting opaque and distant stakeholders’ relationship places shippers and other stake-
holders in an uncertain situation to defend their interests. This conflictual and legally unbal-
anced situation should be ended. 

§  Recommendation 
ESC  has  thus  concluded,  jointly  with  other  Associations,  that  the  European  Commission 
should repeal the Consortia BER unless a revised regulatory framework clarifying the scope 
of application of the BER is adopted. 

2.  ADVOCACY 

The specific measures advocated by ESC as an indispensable part of a reformed BER are described 
below: 

2.1 EXEMPTION BASE DEFINITION.  

The present BER criteria used to identify those consortia which are exempted are neither 
defined  clearly  enough,  nor  measurable.  This  may  have  accommodated  the  setting-up  of  
large consortia. ESC acknowledges the importance of the benefits of the BER for smaller con-
sortia but calls for the following points to be reviewed in order to clarify the status of larger 
consortia: 

§  Market threshold 

A re-definition of the threshold to consider the market power should be introduced. It would 
trigger the obligation to abide to fulfilling efficiency targets and undergoing regular monitor-
ing of performance, also by taking into  consideration all the individual “relevant markets” 
percentage as the reference figure percentage level. 

§  Market share measurement 

The market share should be calculated based on an assessment of the effects arising from 
the combined fleets of each consortium member as well as capacity of carriers/consortia per 
trade lane, and not on volumes, as the statistics on volumes are not readily available and 
market power is proportionate to capacity.

In addition, it is necessary to consider the market shares of consortia on all trade lanes as-
sessed.  Indeed,  it is conceivable that the market share of a consortium may exceed the BER 
threshold on a given trade lane and at the same time, be below the threshold on another 
trade lane. This poses the question if a consortium may credibly claim the benefits of the BER 
on the trade lane where its market share is below the BER threshold; whilst operating outside 
the BER. Additionally, subject to Article 101 TFEU on the trade lane where its market share 
exceeds  the  BER  threshold,  it  is  also  necessary  to  clarify  the  provision  on  exceeding  the 
threshold longer than what the regulation mentions as two consecutive calendar years. 

Consortia members will have necessarily acquired  significant knowledge  of business sensi-
tive information and practices of each other when operating on a given trade lane under the 
benefits of the BER and this fact makes it difficult to accept that they compete at arm’s length 
against each other on the trade lane where the BER threshold requirement is not met.   In 
such circumstances, it would strongly appear that the benefit of the BER should not be avail-
able  to  consortium  members,  also  with  regard  to  the  trade  lane  where  the  consortium’s  
market share satisfies the BER requirements.  

§  Relevant markets  

The BER should provide more specific guidance on relevant service and geographic market 
definition, particularly significant for high traffic trade lanes. 

2.2  INTRODUCTION  OF  OBLIGATIONS  FOR  CONSORTIA  WITH  A  SIGNIFICANT  MARKET 
POWER 

The  large alliances have a significantly greater impact on the market than the smaller VSAs. 
New provisions should be introduced in the BER to identify such highly powerful consortia, 
as proposed in Section 2.2.1 and specific measures should apply to such consortia, detailed 
in Section 2.2.2 below: 

2.2.1 Market power considerations.  
A large, but still eligible for exemption, market share of a consortium in a highly con-
centrated market should be the first criterion to define market power.  
Influence of large consortia’s members on the markets related to other operations of 
overseas maritime transport, such as “domestic” intra EU feeder services, ports ter-
minal operations and inland transport, should also be considered when assessing the 
market power of consortia.

2.2.2 Obligations to be imposed on  consortia with a significant market power 

The EU rarely measures  efficiency gains as a result of consortia or the fair sharing of 
such benefits  between liners and their customers. ESC calls for specific perfor-
mance and transparency commitments to be included in a revised BER for consortia 
enjoying a significant market power as follows: 

§  Quality ratios  
Large  consortia  would  have  to  adhere  to  obligations  of  reliable  communication  of 
targeted and achieved performance, resulting from their joint operations, quantified 
as Key Performance Indicators (“KPI’s”): 

-  KPIs’ should bear on punctuality, reliability and optimized freight operational 

costs. 

-  Sharing of such information should be enforced as an obligation of transpar-

ency to be assessed as well. 

§  Regular reporting for compliance 
In order to allow the monitoring of KPI’s, consortia should be subject to annual re-
porting  requirements  allowing  the  European  Commission  to  ascertain  (1)  the  effi-
ciency gains brought about by each large  consortium operations; (2) the fair sharing 
of such efficiency gains with other parties; and (3) to increase regular data transpar-
ency on consortia, on coverage and relevance. 

§  Monitoring trustee 
Alternatively, the European Commission would be discharged of most of the regulat-
ing workload  by appointing  a monitoring trustee for each large consortium, having 
the task to regularly report to the European Commission on the continued compli-
ance of each consortium with the BER requirements; and if needed propose neces-
sary changes in the operations of a consortium in order to meet the amended BER 
requirements. 

3.  CONCLUSIONS 

ESC recommends to revoke the BER, and replace it with verifiable provisions and mechanisms en-
suring the transfer of benefits arising from consortia operations to shippers and other stakeholders, 
as was the intention of the legislators when introducing the BER. If all these conditions are not met, 
ESC prefers the BER to be completely discontinued.
