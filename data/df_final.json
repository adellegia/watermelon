scale, direct and indirect network effects, control of large data sets by a small number of operators, etc. There is therefore a growing consensus among competition policy experts that these factors create structural competition problems, including market concentration. ","1":"The fact that some platforms, such as Google and Facebook are allowed to combine the large troves of data they collect through their user-facing products (e.g., Search, YouTube, Instagram) and business-facing products (online advertising intermediation services, authentication services, etc.) also protects their dominance in some markets and makes market entry difficult. \nThe most problematic scenarios are those involving:\n-\tMarket tipping: Digital markets often tip due inter alia to customer behaviors, high fixed costs and the presence of strong direct and indirect network effects. When tipping is facilitated (or maintained) by anticompetitive behaviour, competition law can be used to bring such behaviour to an end, but as noted above, competition proceedings may be too slow to prevent tipping or in some cases competition law may not apply to the conduct in question (e.g., monopolization).\n-\tMonopolization: Article 102 TFEU only becomes applicable when dominance can be shown. A direct and quantifiable harm is also often required. EU competition law thus suffers from an enforcement gap. In markets that quickly tip, this is problematic considering that it may delay intervention until such time competition harm has been created and may be irreversible. Worse, ending anticompetitive behaviours may not be sufficient to restore competition if no entrant comes to invest and challenge dominant firms supported by network effects. \n-\tVertical leveraging: Digital gatekeepers seek to leverage the market power they have on their core market, which are often consumer-oriented, to adjacent markets. While competition law can be used to bring such attempts to an end, competition law investigations take time and competitive damage may be permanent by the time investigations are completed. Measures equivalent to those imposed by the EU in network industries (telecoms, energy, transport, etc.) to prevent vertical leveraging and discrimination are also needed here.\n-\tGatekeeper scenarios: When digital platforms control access to a vast number of users, which do not multi-home, they often refuse to negotiate and engage in both exclusionary and exploitative behaviours. For instance, they may self-preference their own products (e.g., Google may preference its ad exchange over rivals) or they may impose unfair trading conditions on the users of their platforms (e.g., 30% commissions to access users on many platforms).See our response to questions 8.3 and 8.4.As illustrated by the Commission decisions against Google (Google Shopping, Android), vertical leveraging can eliminate competition in an otherwise competitive market. If vertical leveraging strategies are not curbed, there is a risk that many digital markets will be dominated by a few digital gatekeepers, depriving consumers from quality, choice and innovation. ","2":"Vertical leveraging is not novel and has been used by incumbents in network industries (telecoms, energy, etc.) until they were subject to access regulation. And it is not unique to Google as the other digital gatekeepers engage in similar strategies. Vertical leveraging, also called vertical discrimination, differs from traditional vertical integration and does not remove double-margins. When Google leverages its Search dominance to increase its take-rate in digital advertising, it does not benefit anyone but Google.\nGoogle\u2019s self-preferencing strategy on Search is the perfect example where a tool is needed to intervene in the case of repeated strategies. Although in its Google Shopping case the Commission focused on the comparison-shopping services market, the same conduct affected many vertical markets. ","3":"Competition proceedings have to be manageable and cannot involve multiple vertical markets and repeated proceedings against the same company for similar conduct in different markets. Therefore, in an effort to conserve enforcement resources, another tool is needed to address repeated strategies by digital gatekeepers. This tool should allow the Commission to address the problem at its source and adopt remedies that would assess the conduct \u201cas a whole\u201d rather than its impact in a narrow market. For instance, a general prohibition for digital gatekeepers to engage in self-preferencing in the absence of objective justification is more helpful than repeated antitrust cases seeking to prohibit that behaviour. \nWe do not believe that Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are suitable and sufficiently effective to address those market situations. \nArticle 101 TFEU only captures anticompetitive agreements, while most of the issues identified above result from unilateral action. \nArticle 102 TFEU suffers from several limitations. First, dominance needs to be shown. Second, the Commission is subject to a heavy burden of proof, which it may have difficulties to meet in particularly complex and opaque markets. Third, remedies are also limited to addressing the competition concerns identified in the specific market(s) at hand. Finally, fines are not sufficient remedies for behemoth companies, such as Google, Apple and others.\nAs a result, while Article 102 TFEU is the right instrument for the Commission to address one-off conduct in a given market, it is not an ideal tool to address structural problems, such as those observable in some digital markets.Digital markets.Our understanding of the notion of monopolization is that it is a course of conduct pursued by a company in order to acquire monopoly power through anticompetitive means. Thus, unlike in the case of Article 102 TFEU, an antitrust intervention in monopolization cases does not require a showing of dominance.","4":"Google has for instance monopolized the entire supply chain in the ad tech sector through a combination of practices, including acquisition of vertically-related companies with established positions, reduced interoperability (including under the guise of privacy), data hoarding, exclusive dealing, etc. Because these practices often take place under the radar screen through subtle policy changes, competition may be permanently harmed by the time competition authorities are able to intervene. ","5":"By combining data from various user-facing and business services, digital gatekeepers may also create competitive advantages that will reduce or eliminate the ability of rivals to compete. Once again, these practices can be made through subtle changes in privacy policies, that may not be visible until such time it is too late to intervene.See our response to question 10.3.See our response to question 10.3.Because digital markets can tip quickly, swift intervention, even below the dominance threshold level, may be necessary to protect competition.Article 101 TFEU may not be the right tool when the harmful conduct takes the formal of unilateral action and Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance, which may delay intervention until the damage to competition has become permanent.","6":"-  E-commerce marketplace: Here again, it seems that Amazon is an extremely strong market position, which will be hard to challenge by actual or potential rivals. \nThe expert reports that have been prepared under the aegis of the EC (Competition Policy in a Digital Era), the UK government (the Furman report), the University of Chicago (Stigler report), etc., all confirm that the presence of the market features listed in question 10.3 makes a market prone to tipping. The evidence is overwhelming.Yes, see our response to question 16.2.The first four factors listed at 16.7 are both linked and very important.","7":"When a market tips, harm to competition may become permanent. As a result, even efficient companies may find it hard to enter the market in the presence of large economies of scale and strong network effects. This explains why companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon have maintained significant market power in their core market for the past decade.","8":"The absence of competition will expose consumers to reduced (or absence of) choice, lack of innovation (compared to the counterfactual of a competitive market), and higher prices \/ lower quality.Because it is generally difficult to restore competition once the market has tipped, the Commission should have a tool that allows it to intervene beforehand.Article 101 TFEU does not apply to unilateral conduct and Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance, which may delay intervention.","9":"Other tools are needed to allow the Commission to intervene before damage to competition becomes permanent.Because of the characteristics of some key digital markets (large economies of scale, presence of strong direct and indirect network effects, etc.), a small subset of companies will end up dominated critical online services, such as algorithmic search, social networking, the separate markets for the distribution of apps to iOS and Android device users; e-commerce, etc. Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are gatekeepers.","10":"-\tThe fact that business users need to accept the terms and conditions of a platform even if they are anticompetitive \/ unfair shows that this platform enjoys significant market power and that there is little multi-homing.The three competition concerns identified in 18.9 are in line with our experience. \nWhen dealing with digital gatekeepers, companies have to accept their terms and conditions even if they are highly unfavorable to them. Gatekeepers act as private regulators and participants have no choice but to accept their rules, however anticompetitive\/unfair they may be.Yes, a special tool is needed to address the structural competition problems created by digital platforms as Articles 101 and 102 TFEU may not be the adequate vehicles to address these problems.  Competition law investigations are fact-specific (and thus tend to be narrow in their scope, as well as in the remedies ultimately adopted) and such investigations take a great deal of time. \nA tool that would allow the Commission to take a broader, market-wide view of the problems and adopt broader remedies is thus desirable.See our response to 19.1Structural competition problems can potentially arise in other sectors than the digital sector if these sectors share some of the features of the digital sector, e.g. the presence of gatekeepers. \nThus, in theory, there is no reason why the New Competition Tool should be limited to digital markets only, except if extending the scope of this tool to other sectors threatened its existence.","11":"\nAs already noted above, Article 101 TFEU will generally not capture problematic unilateral conduct.It can be in any market situation where the conduct is unilateral.While Article 102 TFEU has allowed the Commission to intervene to bring a wide range of anticompetitive practices to an end, it nevertheless suffers from some limitations:","12":"-\tBecause a showing of dominance is needed, Article 102 TFEU is unable to capture monopolization strategies. There is therefore an enforcement gap, which is particularly problematic in markets prone to tipping.\n-\tBecause of the heavy burden of proof imposed on the Commission and the need to show effects to establish an infringement, Article 102 TFEU investigations take time, which is again problematic in markets prone to tipping.\n-\tRemedies need to address the competition concerns specifically identified by the Commission, hence they tend to be narrow.","13":"The Commission should also actively enforce Article 102(a) TFEU. This leaves platform participants without protection from exploitative practices of digital gatekeepers.The issues identified in 23.1 are not specific to any digital market in particular, although they have particularly manifested themselves in the search engine market where Google has used its market power to systemically exclude rivals in adjacent markets. They represent general limitations to Article 102 TFEU given the scope of this provision or the way it has been interpreted by the Commission.See our responses above.See our responses above.","14":"In particular, the imposition of mandatory remedies subject to strict monitoring (or when monitoring is not possible structural remedies). \nThe Commission should have an important degree of flexibility when defining remedies. Hence, it should be allowed to do all of the above as the type of remedies needed depends on the identified problem.","15":"Structural remedies are preferable when monitoring is likely to be difficult, which is often the case given the complexity and the opacity of the digital gatekeepers\u2019 practices.Appropriate investigative powers are necessary to address structural competition problems.See our response above.If deadlines are not binding they will not be complied with, particularly given the digital gatekeepers\u2019 strategy of obfuscation.While the ability to adopt interim measures belongs with the EU competition arsenal, they have rarely been used. The adoption of interim measures is desirable especially in markets prone to tipping and where harm to competition, if challenged too late, may become permanent.Yes, voluntary commitments may be a way to obtain faster results than a full market investigation.Yes, that is important from a due process standpoint, but this should not create an opportunity to delay the final decision.*?Yes, that is important from a due process standpoint, but this should not create an opportunity to delay the final decision.Yes, that is important from a due process standpoint, but this should not create an opportunity to delay the final decision.See our response above.","16":"The  instinct  of  regulators  and  policymakers  to  hold  large  platforms  like  Facebook  and  Google  to \naccount for their role in the proliferation of online disinformation and in the undermining of quality \njournalism is right. With the necessary political will, solutions exist that will help rein in the epidemic \nof  disinformation  that  is  sweeping  away  trust  in  established  facts,  in  scientific  method  and  in \ndemocratic institutions designed to protect us. ","17":"The  basis  of  such  solutions  lies  in  taking  on  disinformation  at  its  source,  that  is,  by  taking  on  the \nbusiness model of large platforms such as Facebook and Google which stoke outrage for revenue and \nengage  in  the  \u201cmonetising  of  lies\u201d  as  the  European  Commission  itself  has  called  it.

Foreign  powers  continue  to \nsubvert democratic processes via manipulative campaigns on the largest platforms. ","19":"At the same time, the power of the platforms is has grown exponentially, not only via their dominant \nposition but also through widely-reported influence-buying campaigns that have gone a significant \nway to co-opting  the very information sectors they undermine: journalism and media organisations \nincreasingly  dependent  on  fact-checking  contracts  from  the  platforms;  academia  increasingly \ndependent  on  data-analysis  contracts  from  the  platforms,  and  even  policymakers  who  see  no \nalternative but depending on the platforms for rooting out illegal and borderline illegal content one \npost at a time.

In case if a given conduct does not fullfill the above mentioned criteria, it shall not raise competition concerns.","36":"In case of oligopolistic markets, undertakings may be able to enter into tacit collusion, meaning parallel behaviour without pre-existing anti-competitive behaviour. This can happen in any market of this structure. Highly prevalent in case of gas stations and other markets with few players.In our opinion, proving tacit collusion is a highly difficult task, which requires a case by case examination. All of the criteria listed above can be to some extent relevant, however, it is not possible to assess their relevance ex ante.","37":"Tacit collusion is one of the most distortive practices for the competition and the European Commission should be able to intervene in such cases. However, we have to stress that there is nothing in current regime established under Art. 101 and 102 that would hold back the Commission from investigating and penalising such behaviour. In order to maintain consistency and simplicity of the European legal order, we would highly recommend the Commission to look into possibilities of more effective investigation of oligopolies under the existing legislative framework in the first place.","38":"The phenomenon of tipping can happen in various markets. Whereas it is true that tipping can happen relatively often in digital markets, one should note that digital market is a highly misleading name for a big and diversified sector.In order to identify tippng, we would suggest to use all the above mentioned criteria on a case by case basis and perform a weighing exercise. It is very hard, if not difficult, to propose a specific weight to a given criterion ex ante. Moreover, we would recommend the Commission to provide a rigorous guidance on the interpretation of the above mentioned concepts as to ensure their uniform application and understanding.Please see the answer to question 16.2.Please see our anwser to question 16.4.The current legal framework of Art. 101 and Art. 102 might be insufficient to address the issue of tipping effectively - in case of 101 there is no agreement or concerted practice, whereas in case of 102 the undertaking might not necessary be dominant and hence would not fall under the article. Therefore, we reckon that it might be beneficial for the protection of competition in the market for the Commission to extend its' powers in such cases.","39":"The Commission seems to identify a gatekeepers with undertaking of very high market share, enjoying economies of scale as well as direct and indirect network effects. In our opinion, such a definition is applicable to various quasi-monopolistic, veritcally integrated sectors.Please see anwser to question 18.4.As in previous cases, we consider all of the mentioned critreria as highly relevant. The European Commission should provide thorough guidance as to the precise meaning of proposed concepts.We believe that such assessment would require a case-by-case analysis.The Commission should intervene to protect fair competition in the EU market. If gatekeeping is to have anti-competitive effects on downstream undertakings, the Commission should take appropriate actions.","40":"We would support a new competition tool, which would allow for greater data portability, consequently facilitating multi-homing and decreasing barriers to entry for new market players.\nMoreover, such new tool could provide an efficient way to analse and understand the markets better via advanced evidence-gathering.We understand the willingness of the Commission to create a tool, which could be used both ex post and ex ante. However, we would like to bring the attention of the Commission to the fact that an ex ante tool can have a chilling effect on innovation and competition, especially in the early stages of its implementation. Therefore, we would urge the Commission to provide thorough and concrete guidance as well as adequate safeguards, which will allow undertakings to defend their interests, especially in the early phases of utilization of the new tool.","41":"In order to maintain consistency between Commission's various functions, the new powers granted for the execution of the New Competition Tool should match these enjoyed by the Commission within the framework of antitrust proceedings.Please refer to our response to question 31.1.We believe that imposition of strict deadlines can lead to more procedural efficinecy, however it can lead to certain risks. To be precise, deadlines should not lead to prioritization of time over mertis of the investigation.Yes, however only under strict requirements. At the same time, we would like to invite the Commission to assess the effectiveness of antiturst investigations under the current material and procedural framework.The Union of Entrepreneurs and Employers fully supports the idea of extending volutary commitments to the new competition tool. The system has been tested and worked well under Art. 102. Moreover, it increases procedural efficiency and incentivizes the undertakings to change their behaviour.Even though such a provision could increase procedural fairness and position of parties to the proceedings, we would like to draw the attention of the Commission to the fact that it might stand in opposition to well-established competition procedure. For the sake of the EU legal system, the Commission should in the first place assess the compatibiltiy of new proposals with existing framework.Please see the response no. 37.1.In our view, all competition tools have to be subject to adequate procedural safeguards, indlucing judicial review, in order to guarantee procedural fairness and equality of arms. \nIn order to increase procedural fairness, the new competition tool could be appelable. It would also increase democratic legitimacy of the EU and the Commission.","42":"See our position paper attachedThese practices are common in the digital sector as there is a business advantage for the online platforms due to their size.

Secondly, to address these business practices,we would need an ex ante regulation process, that identifies a list of good practices to follow, and allows the regulator to intervene before the damage is created and impossible to repair.See our position paper attachedIn the audivisual sector, and morevover in the production of Films and TV Series The question of data covers several fields: the data transparency about audiences, the data transparencies about revenues, the data transparency to fulfill the regulation, the data transparency on the uses of algorithms.\nEach of these fields have a different player in front and different interests.","43":"The lack of transparency about the audiences of the shows:\nThe practice of information retention when it comes to online streaming as opposed to the public information shared by broadcasters or theaters brings an uneven balance of power in our industry. It leads to a lack of industry information  when evaluating the market.\n \nRights holders supplying content to VOD services and to the Film and TV series production sector as a whole are not given full access to the audience figures and data for their works. As rights holders, we need to keep the knowledge of our audiences in order to be able to be creative and to innovate. Some SVOD platforms have started to share data about the shows they commissioned to the rights holders of these shows. But they are voluntary based, partial and difficult to compare across services. This is in marked contrast to cinema distribution and broadcasting where box office and audience figures are available through specific services gratuitously or at a reasonable cost.\n \nThis need for transparency regards the knowledge of the audiences but also the share of revenues. Rights holders need to have access to the audience figures in order to have a share of revenues on the works they created.

These principles are  deeply enshrined in the \nUnion\u2019s legal system and in the case of free trade, fundamental to its existence. They are vital \nin  ensuring  that  the  conditions  are  right  for  investment  and  innovation  and  in  ensuring  the \ncompetitiveness of the European market.   ","49":"With  these  core  principles  in  mind,  Sky  would  urge  the  Commission  to  proceed  cautiously \nbefore proposing new regulation.  The Commission must be confident that there is a clear and \nobvious gap within its existing toolkit and any new ex ante rules that are introduced and clear \nas to the specific problems that cannot be addressed with greater use of those powers. If, at \nthe end of these consultations the Commission is satisfied that this threshold (which is a high \none) is passed, then it must proceed cautiously in the design of any new NCT, to ensure it is \nthe  minimum  required  to  address  clearly  identified  harms.    Failure  to  do  so  risks  significant \nunintended  consequences,  chilling  investment  and  undermining  the  significant  achievements \nmade to date via the single market.   ","50":" \n \n \n \n\fThe proposal to develop a \u2018new competition tool\u2019 has emerged as part of the debate about the \nadequacy of existing competition law, and associated processes, to address issues associated \nwith digital markets.  Indeed, the proposal forms part of the Commission\u2019s package in relation \nto a Digital Services Act, and the inception impact assessment explicitly refers to its origin in \nrelation to the broad discussion about whether competition law is fit for purpose in the digital \nage.  The proposal that it should apply to all sectors of the economy, rather than in relation to \ndigital services, is an extremely significant extension of that original idea, and is not justified. ","51":"As  noted  above,  the  impact  assessment  refers  to  the  fact  that  there  has  been  extensive \ndiscussion, and numerous in-depth inquiries, across the world, on the subject of the adequacy \nof existing competition law and processes in relation to digital products and services.  There \nhas been no such discussion or debate in relation to the adequacy of existing competition law \nand processes in more traditional markets.  We consider that a proper debate and discussion \nof this issue is a critical pre-requisite for a proposal for a NCT that applies to all sectors of \nthe economy.      ","52":"The  current  justifications  put  forward  for  a  broad  NCT  do  not  withstand  scrutiny.    The \nassertion that all sectors of the economy are becoming digitised, and therefore arguments in \nsupport  of  the  introduction  of  the  NCT  in  digital  sectors  apply  equally,  does  not  stand  up.  \nEqually,  propositions  such  as  the  NCT  being  required  to  deal  with  undesirable  market \nstructures, or behaviour of non-dominant firms, in all markets across the economy,  lack any \njustification and cannot form a proper basis for a wide-ranging NCT.  ","53":"If a NCT is required at all, to fill clearly identified gaps not currently served by Articles 101 \nand  102,  sector  inquiries,  or,  importantly,  to  be  served  by  any  new  ex  ante  rules,  then  Sky \nconsiders that a more targeted and proportionate form of intervention, in digital markets only, \nis appropriate. ","54":"Without  prejudice  to  this  position,  if  a  NCT  is  introduced,  in  any  form,  it  would  require \nfundamental changes to the current approach to checks and balances in the area of European \ncompetition policy.  A NCT of the type currently proposed would give the European Commission \nenormous  ability  to  intervene  in  markets  in  ways  that  have  potentially  far  reaching \nconsequences  \u2013  for  example,  by  forcing  companies  to  make  major  changes  to  their \nbusinesses,  including  requiring  divestments  \u2013  without  any  finding  of  wrong-doing  or \nanticompetitive behaviour.   ","55":"In particular, appeals of competition decisions in Europe currently take too long.   For example, \nthe judgment overturning the European Commission\u2019s decision in Three\/O2 happened some 5 \nyears  after  the  deal  was  announced  and  long  after  it  could  be  resurrected.      Given  the \npotential  significant  economic  damage  that  could  result  from  inappropriate  interventions  in \nmarkets under the NCT, appeal processes would need to be much quicker.

Given the special responsibility applied to these companies, the notion of dominance should not be extended to somewhat vague concepts of important market power. Doing otherwise would significantly jeopardize legal certainty and market intervention may lead to undesired effects.\nAs explained earlier, highly concentrated markets are not a problem per se.  If the market is characterised by regular\/constant innovation, high quality products, and heterogenous products, the chances for competitors to align their market behaviour are pretty low, even when there are not many competitors around.\nA gatekeeper scenario is not per se a structural competition problem, it is problematic where a company is dominant and abuses its market power to exclude competitors, for example by locking-in customers who can no longer go to a competitor.   \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU provide for the sufficient legal basis to catch any of these scenarios. \nTipping markets are usually very prone to innovation with fast rises and equally fast falls. As a result, these should not be treated as structural competition concerns.","59":"The European Commission should not have the power to intervene in cases where there is no dominance.In principle, Article 101 and 102 provide for the necessary legal basis to deal with most situations.Anti-competitive monopolisation strategies cut across all sectors and markets and are not specific to the digital sector.Please see our response above.Anti-competitive monopolisation strategies cut across all sectors and markets. They are not specific to the digital sector.By definition, monopolisation achieved through anti-competitive means raises concerns \u2013 this is however not a new theory of harm but the very essence of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.The Commission may need to intervene before a company reaches the status of \u201cmonopoly\u201d because of their essential function for competition. However, in such a case, the Commission should bear the burden of proof of demonstrating such monopolisation, the monopolising status must be rebuttable, and operators should be in a position to have this reviewed any time by means of a submission of their own initiative, as market conditions evolve.Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are suitable and sufficiently effective to address anti-competitive monopolisation.Oligopolies are present in a variety of markets and sectors. However, as in non-digital markets, where vertical integration (of essential infrastructure) companies created similar harm, these can be addressed sufficiently by Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.Not all oligopolies constitute a competition problem. Only certain oligopolies may lead to tacit collusion and this only if the market presents certain features, as those described in the Table in 12.3.Oligopolies are noticeable in a multitude of markets, also in digital markets, even if to a lesser extent. Even if oligopolistic, the majority of digital markets are driven by innovation, offer technically complex products which are typically not homogenousThe Commission should only intervene to the extent that the behaviour in question raises a competition issue under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.","60":"Article 101 TFEU is sufficient to address markets with pricing algorithms, as in traditional cases of collusion.Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are perfectly suitable to deal with all competition issues arising in this context.  The Commission could deal with this in the same way as in traditional cases of collusion, treating new techniques simply as a new means of collusion between operators (see Ethuras case).Tipping markets are prevalent in a wide variety of markets and sectors with strong network effects.Direct network effect are essential in a tipping market. If coupled with single home customers this may create an additional lock-in effect. \nEconomies of scale are also of the essence for tipping markets, as the number of customers and the fact of achieving a critical threshold of customers is key.  A competitor would need a significant number of customers to make its average costs fall below the market.  Without such critical amount there are no profits and thus the competitor may be obliged to leave the market.  \nHowever, there are many scenarios, where digital markets appear to have tipped but later they are disrupted by a novel business model. In the digital economy, competition can be non-linear and based on (very often radical) innovation  \nCertain types of digital business models and technologies operate on the basis of large amounts of users for their technology\/product to be successful.  However, other digital markets are not more prone to tipping than non-digital markets where penetration is also a factor of success.All of the above competition concerns are risks linked to dominant firms who abuse their position. Existing competition law can tackle that and tools like interim measures can also help prevent further monopolisation through early intervention. \nMarkets can be disrupted by changing consumer attitudes, new entrants and new technology. Intervening prematurely under the assumption of tipping could lead to distortion of competition.\nTipping is a relative concept and premature intervention may damage technological innovation and progress.Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are able to address effectively gatekeeper scenarios. Additionally, the Commission can already use interim measures against an undertaking if there is a risk that it uses anticompetitive means to tip the market.Certain key technologies, key datasets, and key digital infrastructures can play a role in helping certain operators with a gatekeeper status. This status can however be lost again over time and is in flux as markets evolve, just as in non-digital markets.A gatekeeper scenario can also occur in non-digital markets. This would be the case, for example, of a paper magazine given for free to users and making profits through advertising.The lack of multi-homing can be a very important factor as it can prevent others from entering the market thus leaving all control to one single entity. This should be assessed on a case by case basis in combination with other factors, including the competitive pressures on all sides of multi-sided markets. \nThe fact that business users need to accept the conditions of the gatekeeper is not relevant given that any platform that is open to users \u2013 whether businesses or final consumers \u2013 must determine the user experience and the conditions for engaging on the platform. Standard terms and conditions are widespread in the economy, with companies of all sizes, digital or not. They create efficiencies, enable scale, consistency of services, and help ensure users are treated equally.  The use of standard terms and conditions is what makes it possible to successfully host users.  A model based on individually negotiated terms would massively increase transaction costs and cause substantial delays on onboarding new users. This could only be a competition concern if these conditions are unfair. \nSee 18.8The Commission should be able to intervene against abuses of their dominant position by gatekeepers i.e. where a gatekeeper infringes Article 102 TFEU. The mere achievement of a gatekeeping position is not as such an infringement of competition, just like holding a dominant position is not a problem. Companies should not be prevented by the Commission from becoming successful.As explained in question response to question 18.2, Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are sufficient to address competition concerns that may arise from a gatekeeper situation. \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU have been applied by the Commission and interpreted by the EU Courts in a way that can address any behaviour that may raise antitrust concerns, including behaviour related to those raised by so-called gatekeepers.  The Commission should not depart from well-defined concepts of dominance, as it is likely to lead to significant uncertainty.","61":"Article 101 TFEU is sufficient to address any collusive behaviours that would result from structural competition problems. The scope is already broad enough to cover pricing algorithms, as in traditional cases of collusion.See response to Q. 20.1Article 102 TFEU is sufficient to address potential competition concerns.See Answer to Q. 20.1See our response to Question 25.1AmCham EU appreciates the efforts of the Commission in reviewing the effectiveness of the current competition rules, including the adequacy of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. These reviews based on new facts and insights are important to ensure that competition remains buoyant and its enforcement not only effective, but also timely and proportionate. \nThe Commission has highlighted that it is focusing on network effects, economies of scale, multi-homing and lock-in effects which can potentially distort competition and we agree that the prevention of the distortion of competition should indeed remain a key objective for regulators. \nHowever, AmCham EU believes that the Commission is well equipped and already has the necessary legal tools to address any potential competition concerns. Therefore, there is no need to introduce a new competition tool as currently proposed. This notwithstanding, should the Commission decide to implement a new competition tool (NCT), we would recommend the following guiding principles:","62":"2.\tThe \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d, which are the focus of the proposed NCT, cannot be any kind of \u201cstructural competition problem\u201d. The NCT can only be used for new \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d.  The NCT must not be used to address \u201ctraditional\u201d competition problems (structural or otherwise), as these problems (structural or otherwise) have so far been (satisfactorily) addressed with the existing legal toolbox.","63":"AmCham is of the view that there should not be a new competition tool. Therefore, the above questions are not applicable.  Nevertheless, should the Commission  decide to forego AmCham\u2019s recommendations on the matter and move forward with its new competition tool, \nwe believe that a continuous and appropriate dialogue is vital. Indeed, AmCham EU regularly facilitates a dialogue in relation to competition policy through its Committee activities (e.g., its Annual Competition Conference), and supports any additional measures that may be necessary to ensure a well-functioning competitive landscape. \nAs part of this dialogue, we encourage the Commission to ensure that industry players and regulators continue to exchange views and approaches in the context of a clear and proportionate regulatory framework. \nAmCham EU is of the view that the Commission should not have the ability to impose remedies on companies where there is no clear infringement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.  In this respect, AmCham EU reiterates the need for strong and effective competition law enforcement grounded in sound economic analysis, fair and in any event predictable.As explained above, AmCham EU considers that the Commission should not be able to impose remedies where it cannot establish an infringement of Articles 101 or 102 TFEU. \nAdditionally, given that the proposed new competition tool seems to target to a very substantial extent single firm conduct without providing the substantive and procedural safeguards enshrined in Article 102 TFEU, AmCham EU notes that this creates an incentive to bring cases under the NCT instead of Article 102 TFEU and hence, without the appropriate substantive and procedural guarantees. This is a significant risk, and it should be avoided at all cost that any potential NCT is being used to circumvent existing legal substantive and procedural standards.","64":"As explained above, AmCham EU considers that the Commission should not be able to impose remedies where it cannot demonstrate an infringement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.The Commission already has wide-ranging investigative powers at its disposal to perform its role of enforcing Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, including the power to request information from all undertakings (whether or not they are suspected of infringing the rules) and to carry out investigations at their premises.  The Commission also has the power to engage in sector inquiries","65":"AmCham is of the view that, if the Commission were to decide to introduce such tool, any effective investigative\/redressive competence in respect of competition laws, be it under article 101\/102 TFEU or any potential new competition tool, should be enforced within certain limited time frames.  Especially in fast-moving industries, it is in the interest of any industry and all its participants and stakeholders that investigations are carried out as quickly as possible to enhance legal and economic certainty. At the same time, it is important however that the Commission take the time to properly consider and understand market dynamics before reaching any conclusion, and allow the time for companies to be heard and provide input at various stages in the procedure.Interim measures should only be used in the context of Article 101 or 102 TFEU proceedings, where there is prima facie evidence of an infringement.If the Commission were to decide to introduce an ex ante competition tool, AmCham takes the view that the key in the success of any such potential tool lies in the quality and transparency of the dialogue between enforcers, industry and respective experts.  As indicated above, dialogue and fostering initiatives from within the industry is preferable to any remedy imposed by the Commission or any other regulator.If the Commission were to decide to go ahead with the new competition tool, it is critical that rights of defence and procedural safeguards are incorporated in any new competition procedure. It is important that parties be offered an opportunity to comment on any of the Commission\u2019s findings in such procedures before a final decision is issued. Such safeguards are important to ensure that conclusions are based on firm industry knowledge, and that any remedies are proportionate to the true extent of the potential problem under consideration.Given that AmCham EU is of the view that the power to impose remedies should not be granted to the Commission where there is no infringement of Article 101 and 102 TFEU, third parties should not have the opportunity to review them.The EU is founded on the rule of law and there are strong traditions in EU competition law to protect procedural fairness and rights of defence. \nEU law is based on the primacy of the rule of law and the respect of fundamental procedural rights. The EU Courts require that EU competition enforcement is equally equipped to protect due process and procedural fairness and rights, including rights of defence, rights to be heard, right to appeal and the general principles of proportionality. These procedural safeguards are of the essence and need to be guaranteed. \nThe envisaged new competition tool would be highly intrusive given that it could empower the Commission to impose intrusive remedies. Such measures must be subject to strong procedural safeguards that protect rights of defence effectively.\nBy way of example, the UK markets regime which is similar to the new competition tool that the Commission seems to be considering provides for a number of safeguards.  For instance, at the end of \u201cPhase I\u201d, the CMA is required to consult on its decision to refer a \u201cmarket(s)\u201d for in-depth investigation and to specify which \u201cfeatures\u201d it intends to investigate. The subsequent referral decision can be appealed to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (under a judicial review standard) and thereafter to the UK Court of Appeal.  These consultation and appeal rights provide an important guarantee of companies\u2019 rights of defense. The decision to impose remedies at the end of a market investigation is also subject to judicial review. The phase II decision itself is made by a panel of independent CMA members retained for that purpose rather than by the CMA hierarchy.  There are several examples of successful appeals that have resulted in a decision being quashed (in whole or part) and\/or remitted to the CMA for reconsideration (e.g., Groceries (2009), Payment protection (2009), Private healthcare (2013)).In view of the fact that AmCham EU is a representative body of many companies active in various industries. It is not well-positioned to respond to this question.","66":"Once we recognize that economies of scale and scope on the supply and demand side of the \nmarket create efficiencies, we must accept the proposition that there will be small numbers of \nfirms supplying the functionalities that consumers want because their costs and prices will be \nlower. This is an infrastructure problem that has existed since the birth of capitalism. The answer \nhas always been to design a structure that provides the shared infrastructure and makes it \navailable to all users on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms. There have \nbeen a variety of solutions, from regulated, private, franchise provision (common carriers, \nturnpike trusts) to state ownership.  Unregulated private provision has been a disaster for well \nover a century because the economic interests of the private actors conflict with the public \ngood.  The question is not whether to regulate the behavior, but how.   ","67":"Regulated competition is the answer, where the goal is to promote competition in decentralized \ncapitalist markets along two dimensions\u2014the core infrastructure market and markets that rely on \nsuch infrastructure\u2014both of which require constraints on market power, which is \u201cinefficient.\u201d \nInefficiency can be measured by prices and profits above costs, diseconomies of scale and scope, \nor artificial barriers to entry.  Thus, along the first dimension, because we do not know the \nprecise limits of the economies of scale and scope, we hold out the hope that there can be \ncompetition for the core infrastructure services.  Along the second dimension, we are much more \nconfident that there can be competition for the complements that ride on the \ninfrastructure.  Anticompetitive behavior that limits potential competition along either dimension \nmust be regulated and eliminated or diminished.  ","68":"Sometimes, we break the infrastructure into pieces, either horizontally (considering economies of \nscale) or vertically (considering economies of scope).  However, that is not always the best \nanswer.  Sometimes it is better to ensure FRAND access to the infrastructure, which, above \nall,  addresses the problem for the competition from complements, but which can also lower the \nbarriers to entry for head-to-head competition for the provision of infrastructure (i.e., competitors \ncombine FRAND access to parts of the infrastructure with other parts that they self-supply). \nThe answer is complicated but so too is the digital economy.  Anticompetitive conduct is \ngenerally easy to define, but may be difficult to prove.  Clearly identifiable complements that \nshould not have been integrated with the infrastructure may be easy to see, but identifying \nwhether the right solution is divestiture or structural separation is more \nchallenging.  Encouraging the entry of competitive supply of complements is always the right \nthing to do, but response to the removal of entry barriers may be too slow without action against \nvertical integration.        ","69":"The high degree of concentration among big data platforms is reinforced by three other factors \nthat create a \u201ctight oligopoly on steroids,\u201d which the commission highlights in its discussion of \ntacit collusion. High concentration is reinforced by multi-market contact, technological \nspecialization, product segmentation, and geographic separation (for Big Broadband Networks) \nor must-have bundles (for Big Data Platforms). As shown in the following table, our working \npapers show that the tight oligopoly on steroids afflicts both the communications networks (Big ","70":"Gatekeeper control of chokepoints, reinforced by steroids, gives the small number of firms that \ndominate the digital communications sector immense market power. They have demonstrated \ntime and again that they have the willingness and ability to abuse that market power. Specific \nareas where policy can move forward in spite of the complexity include: ","71":"While some of these policies should apply to all firms in the market and may be addressed by \ngeneral policies \u2013 e.g., a structure of supply side transparency and demand side consumer choice \n(sovereignty) \u2013 others should focus on dominant firms. A \u201ctraditional\u201d measure of dominance \nshould be used.  A tight oligopoly exists where the top four firms have a 60% (or more) market \nshare, and all firms that could constitute this market share should be well regulated. While action \nagainst anticompetitive structures and conduct should be taken against firms who constitute the \ntight oligopoly, scrutiny should not stop there. The empirical evidence we have reviewed shows \nthat \u201cfour is few, six may be enough, and ten are many.\u201d  Scrutiny of higher numbers of firms \n(4\u201310) should be subject to complaint and might shift the burden to complaining firms. ","72":"While dual jurisdiction (antitrust and regulation) has been essential to oversight over the \ncommunications sector, and should remain so, it is important to have clear regulatory \nresponsibility vested in specific agencies (we prefer a new digital regulatory agency). Because of \nthe large benefits, the approach should be to achieve the desired pro-competitive, pro-consumer \noutcomes with the least amount of intervention necessary.   ","73":"Subject to agency expertise and practice, no remedies should be taken off the table, and the threat \nof extreme action is a useful prod to corrective action. However, no remedies should be \nmandated before careful consideration has been given to the costs and benefits of more extreme \nactions. In order to accomplish its goals with the least intervention necessary, the regulatory \nagency must have full investigative authority, power and resources and it must be subject to \ndeadlines to avoid foot dragging by firms under investigation.  ","74":"The European Games Developer Federation e.f. (EGDF) unites national trade associations representing game developer studios based 18 European countries:  Austria (PGDA), Belgium (FLEGA), Czechia (GDACZ), Denmark (Producentforeningen), Finland (Suomen pelinkehitt\u00e4j\u00e4t), France (SNJV), Germany (GAME), Italy (IIDEA),  Malta (MVGSA), Netherlands (DGA), Norway (Produsentforeningen), Poland (PGA), Romania (RGDA), Spain (DEV), Sweden (Spelplan-ASGD), Slovakia (SGDA), Turkey (TOGED) and the United Kingdom (TIGA). Altogether, through its members, EGDF represents more than 2 500 game developer studios, most of them SMEs, employing more than 35 000 people. ","75":"Games industry represents one of Europe\u2019s most compelling economic success stories, relying on a strong IP framework, and is a rapidly growing segment of the creative industries. European digital single market area is the third-largest market for video games globally. In 2019, Europe\u2019s video games market was worth \u20ac21bn, and the industry has registered a growth rate of 55% over the past 5 years in key European markets. All in all, there are around 5000 game developer studios and publishers in Europe, employing closer to 80 000 people. ","76":"The games industry is one the biggest and the fastest-growing segments of the European cultural and creative industries. The games industry is the forerunner of the digital era. The ever-increasing technological requirements of new games are pushing the boundaries of artistic, technical and business innovation. During the last decade, the games industry was a pioneer of big data analytics and community management. Now, it is taking the same role with, for example, the use of AI in the data-driven creative process.","77":"The games industry is also one of the sectors where market access happens almost exclusively through digital distribution platforms. Especially in the mobile games industry, the two leading large online platforms have a problematic gatekeeper role.Members of the members of European Games Developer Federation develop games on all possible digital distribution platforms: mobile, consoles, PC\/Mac, smartwatches, VR headsets, smart TVs, chat and social media platforms just to name a few.EGDF represents game developers developing digital games, including developers of mobile game apps, console game developers and PC and Mac game developers.Our members use all major digital distribution platforms (e.g. Apple Appstore, Google Play and consoles like Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Switch). Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that game developers do not just use the Alphabet\u2019s services to access the markets through Google Play as a distribution platform. They also use Alphabet\u2019s ad networks for advertisement, attribution and analytics services to measure the effectiveness of the advertisement, the operating system for running the game, cloud services for hosting the files, crash analytics, performance measurement tools, hosting services, machine learning tools, database services and authentication and cloud messaging services.The high degree of horizontal integration: Many of the leading platforms are a part of a huge global conglomerate. Game developers, for example, do not just use Alphabet\u2019s services to access the markets through Google Play as a distribution platform. They also use Alphabet\u2019s ad networks for advertisement, attribution and analytics services to measure the effectiveness of the advertisement, the operating system for running the game, cloud services for hosting the files, crash analytics, performance measurement tools, hosting services, machine learning tools, database services and authentication and cloud messaging services. Consequently, it is not enough to evaluate the vertical integration downstream and upstream the value chain. It is equally important to examine the role of the dominant company horizontally in the ecosystem. \nIf the games industry structural market problems easily lead to a dominant market player extending its market power from the core market to related markets or anti-competitive monopolisation. In the end, these harmful market practices lead highly concentrated markets where companies like Apple and Google become major gatekeepers and de facto oligopoly. ","78":"Examples of practices how dominant market players extend its market power from the core market to related markets: \n- Bundling:  often platforms are bundling the use of one of their services together with the use of another of their services. Google, for example, forces game developers to use Google analytics while using Google advertisement networks. This creates a significant market access barrier for small specialized European service providers.","79":"Examples of anti-competitive monopolisation:\n- Contract terms setting technical limitations: Often, the contract terms of large platforms make it very difficult to use third-party service providers. For example, Apple has set contractual limitations for allowing third party payment systems on its platforms and is now establishing new technical limitations for using other advertisement attribution solutions than their SKAdNetworks. Furthermore, Apple recently threatened to hinder the use of the Unreal game engine to pressure its developer Epic games to stop challenging its contractual terms.\nThese techniques are used by both Apple and Google that are the two dominant market players in the mobile application economy. On the other hand, SKAdNetwork, the solution developed by Apple for advertisement attribution is more privacy-friendly than competing services. On the other hand, it is completely based on data Apple collects from its application store that it does not provide to anyone else and it had made market access for competing services extremely difficult by limiting the use of advertisement identifiers. This demonstrates how it is equally important to analyse the data platforms collect from users and the data platforms block other services from collecting front the users. \nBoth bundling and contract terms setting technical limitations for market access easily push small specialized European services out front the markets.Instead of adopting just a competition law approach, the Commission should consider introducing regulation on unfair non-negotiable B2B contract terms and market behaviour, as it would not require as long investigation to be enforced.In theory yes, however, the competition investigation process is usually so slow that intervention is coming too late for most of the companies struggling with anticompetitive behaviour of the large platforms (often they go bankrupt before the investigation ends).Mobile gamesContract terms setting technical limitations: Often, the contract terms of large platforms make it very difficult to use third-party service providers.

Furthermore, the regulation should limit the possibilities of platforms to introduce anti-competitive contract terms (e.g. banning the use of third-party services.)-For example, in application stores in both Apple and Google market places take about 30% revenue share of all transactions.-","81":"--This happens in smartphone markets, where it is extremely difficult for competing manufacturers to

","94":"Reflecting the industry\u2019s progressive approach to embracing innovative methods of \nproviding access to recorded music online, record companies have licensed hundreds \nof digital music services with more than 60 million tracks1. By 2019, more than 57% of \nrecording industry revenues came from digital uses of recordings, with some 42% from \nsubscription streaming, which is driving a return to growth for the industry.  ","95":"But today\u2019s  recorded  music  market  is  largely  and  increasingly  digital.  That provides \nseveral important advantages. For example, there are few barriers to entry for new \ncompanies. Companies of all sizes have access to global sales channels. As a result, \nconsumers have more choices than ever before, enjoying easy and affordable access \nto  60  million  licensed  tracks  on  music  streaming  services,  while  also  being  able  to \nenjoy music in other digital and physical formats. ","96":"But it is not solely the distribution of recorded music that has evolved. The marketing \nopportunities  for  recording  artists  have  also  diversified  enormously.  For  example, \nartists can now choose to go direct-to-market by producing their own recordings and \nmaking  them  available  on  the  digital  music  platforms  of  their  choice  or  they  can \npartner  with  a  number  of  service  providers  who    have  begun  to  offer  their  own \npackages, from digital distribution to marketing and more.  ","97":" \n \n \n \n \n\fcompany supports all aspects of an artists\u2019 career including distribution, marketing, \npromotion,  touring  and  other  areas.  The  diversity  in  routes  to  market  means  that \nartists have a vast array of choices in how to get their music to their fans and record \ncompanies face stiff competition to partner with them. ","98":"However,  record  companies  remain  the  primary  investors  in  artists  and  repertoire \n(A&R),  supporting  artists\u2019  career  development,  marketing  and  more  to  help  them \nachieve creative and commercial success. Each year, record companies spend about \nUSD 5.8 billion in A&R and marketing combined (USD 4.1 billion going to A&R and USD \n1.7  billion  to  marketing)  to  support  their  artists  \u2013  more  than  one-third  of  the \ncompanies\u2019  revenues.  Furthermore,  record  companies  invest  more  than  financial \nresources, but also human and industry resources. A record company offers the artist \naccess to its network of other music professionals, to its expertise in music production, \nmarketing, promotion and distribution services and numerous other services.   ","99":"A thriving digital music market therefore embodies robust and fair competition at all \nlevels in the value chain. In this short paper, we distinguish between music production \n(the process leading up to and including the production of sound recordings) and the \nultimate distribution of those recordings (the point at which the consumer has access \nto recorded music). ","100":"Music production  \nThe market today is intensely competitive. Thousands of record companies compete \nwith each other and with service providers to attract artists by offering them a vast \nrange of services that cater to their unique needs. Artists may choose not to partner \nwith a record company nor to engage any other service, instead going direct to market \nthemselves.  ","101":"The  existing  competition  rules  and  applicable  thresholds  for  applying  those  rules \nremain valid. We are not aware of any new factors affecting competition which would \nrequire a re-assessment of the adequacy of those rules. As illustrated above, the music \nproduction market is vibrantly diverse, with easy market access for record companies, \nartist  service  companies  and  artists  alike.  The  new  competition  tools  currently \ncontemplated  by  the  Commission,  if  applied  generally  rather  than  in  a  targeted \nmanner to digital services with strategic market power, would raise concerns as they \nwould create legal uncertainty, which in turn is likely to hinder innovation. ","102":"One of the new factors that may require attention, and which is also already identified \nby the Commission, is control of data (such as that collected and kept by the large \ncontent sharing platforms, including social media platforms) as a relevant factor to be \ntaken  into  account when  considering  a  service provider\u2019s positioning  in  the  market \nfrom a competition law perspective.   ","103":"As a digital industry, we are interested in the work undertaken by the Commission to \nexplore  competition  in  digital  markets,  and  we  would  welcome  the  opportunity  to \ncontribute  further  to  this  project.  Our  industry  supports  and  depends  upon  strong \ncompetition, which is already underpinned by the existing regulatory framework. We \nagree that any adjustments to this framework must be based upon clear evidence-\nbased policy, and we look forward to the findings of the present consultation, after \nwhich we hope the Commission will be in a position to more clearly demarcate any \nareas that it considers require further consideration.

","108":"In  this  paper,  we  explain  our  views  on  the  NCT.  Rather  than  addressing  all  of  the  questions  the \nCommission  puts  forward  in  its  questionnaire,  we  have  opted  to  focus  in  more  detail  on  a  more \nlimited  number  of  fundamental questions that the NCT poses in  our view. These are intended to \nillustrate and explain our principal thesis, which is that we believe introducing a new competition tool \ncould provide the Commission with a valuable tool to promote competition, provided that sufficient \nsubstantive and procedural safeguards are put in place.   ","109":"The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides an assessment of the issues which the \nNCT  is  intended  to  address.  Drawing  on  this  analysis,  Section  3  provides  an  evaluation  of  the \nsuitability of the policy options (including existing competition rules) to address those concerns. After \nconcluding that a broad NCT is most appropriate, Section 4 then discusses the outer limits of this \noption  and  the  problems  it  may  not  be  suited  to  address.  Section  5  considers  the  legal  test \nunderpinning the NCT and the need for consistency and coherency with the existing competition law \nframework. Section 6 addresses the remedial powers of the NCT. Section 7 outlines the need for \nadequate procedural safeguards and what that may entail. Section 8 discusses the importance of \neffective  judicial  oversight  of  the  NCT  and  Section  9  concludes  with  an  assessment  of  the \nappropriate legal base for the NCT.  ","110":"To address these issues, we believe that a market structure-based instrument (Options 3 and \n4)  is  the  more  appropriate  tool,  as  it  would  allow  for  market-wide  remedies  which  may  be \nuseful to address both unilateral conduct and structural competition problems. There are also \ngood reasons why the tool should not be limited to certain sectors, notably that the boundaries \nbetween the \u201cdigital sector\u201d and other sectors would be very difficult to define in advance.

","112":"o  Scope:  The  NCT  should  be  designed  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  competitive \nprocess,  not  to  pursue  issues  of  consumer  protection.  It should  not  be  considered \nbroadly as a \u2018market failure tool\u2019, conferring the ability to intervene in markets where \nthey are working poorly \u2013 for any reason.  Whether competition policy is the right tool \nto  address  a  market  failure  depends  on  whether  there  is  a  problem  with  the \ncompetitive process, and whether this can be successfully addressed by intervening \nto fix the competitive process. However, if the objective of the NCT is to fully address \n\u201cstructural  competition  problems\u201d,  the  Commission  should  be  able  to  address \nconcerns regardless of whether they stem from private or public conduct. ","113":"o  Consistency: The NCT should adhere to a legal standard for intervention consistent \nwith the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. Failure to ensure consistency with \nthese  existing  provisions  would,  in  practical  terms,  allow  the  NCT  to  be  used  to \ncircumvent the application of the existing competition rules, potentially undermining \ndecades  of  accumulated  practice  and  jurisprudence.  While  the  fact  that  the  NCT \nwould not result in the imposition of fines may allow more flexibility to create a new \nprecedent,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  rules  set  down  by  existing  provisions  and \ncases can be ignored. Importantly, there is a need for a priority rule to set out in what \ncircumstances  the  NCT  should  apply.  This  requires  a  clear  and  predictable  set  of \nrules which dictates which of the legal tools \u2013 the NCT or existing rules \u2013 is applicable. ","114":"o  Remedies: Plausible remedies should be identified early in the investigative process. \nThis allows the Commission to define the correct counterfactual and make a proper \ncompetitive assessment, and also ensures that investigations are not pursued where \nthere is no plausible competition remedy. Remedies must be proportionate and must \naddress the competitive process: where the Commission is unable to do so, it should \nnot have broad powers to impose, for example, industry price regulation. ","115":"o  Procedural  safeguards:  The  process  must  safeguard  the  rights  of  defence  and \nensure the powers under the NCT are not misused. The NCT should follow a two-\nstage process with clear legal tests for opening an investigation and pursuing an in-\ndepth investigation, to avoid lengthy investigations without a clearly defined theory of \nharm  or  suitable  remedies.  Strict  legal  deadlines  for  each  phase  should  apply. \nMoreover,  affected  parties  should  be  provided  with  the  opportunity  to  make \nsubmissions  (both  in  writing  and  at  hearings)  on  provisional  findings  concerning \nsubstantive  issues  and  remedies.  Indeed,  the  NCT  provides  an  opportunity  to \nstrengthen the oral hearing safeguard, which has been criticised in the past as not \nsufficiently engaging key decision-makers (and as a result, the affected parties).  ","116":"o  Legal  basis:  In  our  view,  it  is  doubtful  whether  Article  103  TFEU  constitutes  an \nappropriate  legal  basis  for  the  adoption  of  the  NCT.  Article  103  TFEU  refers  to \nlegislation  \u201cgiving  effect  to  the  principles  set  out  in  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU\u201d. \nHowever, a distinguishing feature of the NCT, particularly so in respect of the market \nstructure-based Options 3 and 4, is that this tool would be detached from the discrete \ntreaty prohibitions set out in those articles. ","117":"In each case, we  describe the underlying economics of the  topic, with a  particular focus on how \neconomic harm might arise (primarily to consumers) as a result of failures of competition.  We focus \non  where  the  gaps  may  arise  within  the  existing  framework  of  competition  law,  although  a  full \nevaluation of whether new tools are needed to address these concerns is left for the subsequent \nSection 3.  ","118":"For most of these issues, the obvious existing instrument is Article 102 TFEU (although Article 101 \nTFEU is also relevant, especially for the assessment of tacit collusion, as we discuss).  A \u2018gap\u2019 in the \nenforcement of Article 102 TFEU could presumably arise in one or other of the following situations: ","119":"We do not, here, discuss (a) or (b) in detail.  If the concern is just with the evidential weight and due \nprocess requirements of Article 102 TFEU itself, then a new competition tool is unlikely to be the \nright solution.  Similarly, a lower threshold for intervention, below that of foreclosure (which as the \nCommission\u2019s prioritisation guidance establishes, in any case, does not require complete exclusion \nfrom the market), but in a tool focused on similar conduct to Article 102 TFEU should not require a \nnew instrument.  To do so would confuse firms exposed to both.  Furthermore, if the Commission \nbelieves  that  significant  competitive  harm  does,  in  fact,  result  from  exclusion  short  of  what  is \ngenerally understood by \u2018foreclosure\u2019, the obvious solution is to increase the role of effects-based \nanalysis  in  evaluating  concerns  within  Article  102  TFEU  itself.    If,  as  a  pragmatic  matter,  the \nCommission believes that some markets (such as those dependent on digital platforms) require a \npre-existing set of rules to ensure faster treatment of concerns than the existing Article 102 TFEU \ntypically provides, then the ex-ante regulatory tool  proposed in  parallel  by DG  CNECT may  be a \nbetter approach than a new competition instrument.   ","120":"However,  before  dealing  with  the  specific  concerns,  it  is  worth  setting  out  some  more  general \nthoughts on how and why anti-competitive exclusionary effects might arise that cannot be dealt with \nusing Article 102 TFEU.  Dominance is a precondition for Article 102 TFEU because it is generally \nassumed that only a dominant firm would have (a) the ability and (b) the incentive to attempt most \nforms of abuse. Furthermore, the competitive process presumes any firm will  engage in conduct \nintended to increase its revenues partly at the expense of reducing rivals\u2019 revenues. This includes ","121":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fconduct that is generally procompetitive and stimulates investments, including bundling, exclusive \ndealing, loyalty inducing rebates or refusals to deal. In principle, according to economic theory and \nempirical evidence, these practices may lead to foreclosure to the detriment of consumers only when \na firm has significant market power (i.e. enjoys a dominant position). ","122":"The Commission\u2019s guidelines on enforcement priorities make clear that the test of such exclusion is \n\u2018foreclosure\u2019, which should not be understood to mean complete exclusion from the market but a \nsignificant competitive disadvantage (for example, by losing economies of scale and thus becoming \nless  competitive)  imposed  on  a  competitor  by  the  abusive  behaviour.  Many  commentators, \nespecially economists, would add \u2018to the detriment of consumers\u2019 to that definition, not least because \nsuch a rider helps distinguish anti-competitive behaviour which is against consumers\u2019 interests from \npro-competitive behaviour. That has been the subject of much debate in recent years and we do not \nreprise that here. ","123":"In  some  circumstances,  anti-competitive  effects  can  arise  when  a  non-dominant  firm  engages  in \nconduct at one point in time that may allow it to acquire a dominant position in the future - not through \ncompetition on the  merits,  but  through restricting  or distorting  the competitive process in a given \nmarket, or a set of related markets.  ","124":"Take, for example, predatory conduct by a non-dominant firm with very deep pockets.  Consider a \nmarket with very homogenous goods and easy customer switching. A firm with a 30% market share \ncould cut its price below cost. If it had deep pockets to sustain the resulting loses for a long time, \nthis may allow it to capture a large share of the market, perhaps even monopolise it. If rivals had \nexited the market and re-entry barriers were significant the firm may then be able to increase prices \nto  monopoly  levels  and  recoup  the  earlier  (sacrificed)  loses.  At  that  point,  the  firm  is  already \ndominant,  but  the  predatory  conduct  was  initiated  at  a  time  which  the  firm  was  not.  In  principle, \npredation by a non-dominant firm cannot constitute an infringement of Article 102 TFEU unless and \nuntil  it  is  clear  the  market  has  been  monopolised.  Even  ex-post,  it  may  be  extremely  difficult  to \ndistinguish  aggressive  price  competition  by  efficient  firms  from  predatory  (below  cost)  pricing  by \nrelatively less efficient ones. Making the wrong determination in this context can have severe chilling \neffects  on  price  competition.  Yet  arguably,  firms  that  can  extract  excess  rents  in  markets  they \ndominate can finance predatory practices in other, even completely unrelated markets, to acquire a \ndominant position. Having done so, they can raise prices. This may harm consumers overall, even \nconsidering the lower prices during the sacrifice phase.  ","125":"It is not clear how common this is: whether it is a serious concern in practice or merely an interesting \ntheoretical possibility. Only if the exclusion is sufficient to drive competitors entirely from the market \nirreversibly  because  barriers  to  entry  are  high,  could  the  strategy  succeed.  This  is  theoretically \npossible,  but  the  Commission  may  want  to  consider  whether  the  prevalence  of  this  situation \noutweighs  any  economic  harm  that  would  result  from  abandoning  the  reassurance  that  the \ndominance  threshold  provides,  for  non-dominant  firms.    This  applies  particularly  to  evaluating \nconcerns about repeated leveraging and monopolisation. ","126":"The  same  concerns  potentially  arise  when  considering  tipping  markets,  but  in  such  markets  and \n(especially)  in  gatekeeper  scenarios,  the  concern  is  also  likely  to  be  with  point  (d),  above:  when \nactions by firms with control over market conditions could have profound effects on the effectiveness \nof competition in those markets, even if such actions were not aimed at anti-competitive exclusion \nof rivals.  We discuss that concern when we deal with tipping and gatekeepers, in sections 2.6 and \n2.7 below. ","127":"Leveraging could take the form, inter alia, of bundling, in which platforms can leverage their existing \nmarket power by requiring or encouraging the sale of their products in the adjacent market(s) with \ntheir existing services in their core market. Bundling can have anti-competitive or pro-competitive \neffects,  depending  on  the  extent  to  which  it  leads  to  foreclosure  and  efficiencies.  For  instance, \nplatform providers often cite the benefits of more seamless user experience, directly benefiting users \nand  perhaps  allowing  third  parties  such  as  app  developers  to  use  the  platform\u2019s  existing \nfunctionalities.  ","128":"Leveraging can be \u2018offensive\u2019 (to generate more profits) or \u2018defensive\u2019 (preventing entry in the core \nmarket from an adjacent, often niche, market). Offensive leveraging is usually considered less of a \ncompetition concern than defensive leveraging. The former tends to increase competitive pressure \nand  has  positive  effects  on  innovation  in  adjacent  markets.  The  latter  is  often  purely  based  on \nleveraging of market power and rarely has positive effects on innovation in adjacent markets. ","129":"A specific form of bundling in platform markets is \u2018envelopment\u2019 when a platform with market power \nenters a new market pioneered by a rival platform and forecloses it. If the enveloping platform can \nleverage  its  customer  base  from  its  core  market  to  the  adjacent  market  (by  bundling  its  existing \nplatform service with the new platform service), it can benefit from significant network effects when \nit enters the new market, making it more competitive in that market.  In some cases, this advantage \nmight make it more competitive than the incumbent platform, in others, it might merely put the two \non  a  similar  footing.   Therefore,  while  in  some  cases,  rivals  might  be  foreclosed,  in  other  cases \nenvelopment  can  be  efficient  and  pro-competitive,  speeding  up  what  might  otherwise  be  a  slow \nprocess  of  user  adoption  (resolving  the  \u2018chicken  and  egg\u2019  problem  of  how  to  generate  network \neffects). ","130":"We understand that the Commission\u2019s concerns relate to possible leveraging by firms not currently \ndominant (as well as a practical concern as to whether existing tools efficiently address repeated \nleveraging,  which  we  discuss  when  evaluating  the  tools,  in  Section  3,  below).   As  noted  in  the \nintroduction  to  this  section,  as  a  matter  of  economics,  leveraging  strategies  can  be  successfully \nimplemented  by  non-dominant  firms  with  a  certain  degree  of  market  power,  even  short  of \ndominance. Market power can result from, inter alia, control over an essential facility or interface, \nsuperior  access  to  information,  and\/or  more  general  characteristics  of  the  core  market  such  as \nbarriers to entry and customer lock-ins, etc. It can also emerge endogenously, through investments \nin R&D, advertising or direct and indirect network effects.  By leveraging its market power, a non-\ndominant firm could impede competition just enough in an adjacent market to tip it in its favour. ","131":"As Article 102 TFEU applies only to dominant firms, such action would not be covered by existing \ncompetition  law.    However,  this  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  there  is  a  significant  gap  in \nenforcement that requires a new tool because (a) it would need to be demonstrated how common \nsuch non-dominant leveraging strategies are in practice and (b) identifying and effectively dealing \nwith the conduct by a non-dominant firm could be difficult, as we discuss later.  This assessment of \nconduct by non-dominant firms must also consider whether the conduct could be pro-competitive, \njust as (if not more so than) when assessing such conduct by dominant firms.  For this, it is essential ","132":"Similar considerations apply to monopolisation by a non-dominant supplier, as we discussed above \nfor non-dominant leveraging.  Again, the Commission would need to consider both how common \nand  serious  the  problem  is,  as  well  as  the  practical  aspects  of  identifying  and  investigating  non-\ndominant firms, as part of its evaluation. Furthermore, as noted above, it is essential to recognise \nthat some conduct that leads to monopolisation may be efficient.   ","133":"The Commission might be concerned about conduct that appears non-abusive, taken by dominant \nor  non-dominant  firms,  in  a  nascent  market\u2019s  early  days  that  may  lead  to  monopolisation  in  the \nfuture. In practice, the breadth of scope makes it hard to see how intervention could effectively target \nthose actions which turn out to have anti-competitive consequences further down the line, while not \ndeterring those that turn out to be pro-competitive.4 It is near-impossible to \u2018pick winners\u2019, particularly \nin  markets  based  on  technical  standards  in  which  network  effects  can  create  unstoppable \nmomentum, based on tiny or even random initial differences in conditions. The Commission might \nhave  been  concerned  about  the  market-leading  position  or  dominance  of  the  Symbian  O\/S,  for \nexample \u2013 wrongly, in retrospect.  Monopolisation after the fact is easy enough to recognise, but it \nis exceptionally difficult to  identify which small  innovator today might be the  dominant firm  of the \nfuture, let alone discriminate between conduct that would inevitably lead to monopoly power in the \nfuture and harm consumers to the point of offsetting the benefits brought about as the firm acquired \nits dominant position. ","134":"More generally, the prospect of acquiring significant market power and being able to exploit it in the \nfuture is often the most powerful incentive to take investment risks, roll out new ideas, develop new \ntechnologies,  continue  to  improve  upon  existing  products,  and  in  effect,  engage  in  dynamic \ncompetition. Interfering with this process can have the opposite effect intended by antitrust rules. ","135":"Consequently, although monopolisation can occur through actions or by players which might not be \ncaught by the existing Article 102 TFEU provision, any action by the Commission should not seek \nto identify specific firms and actions in advance.  We strongly advise against relying on the NCT to \ntarget  specific  acts  of  nascent  or  attempted  monopolisation  by  non-dominant  firms.  There  is  no \nrobust  economic  framework  that  can  discriminate  between  monopolisation  strategies  by  non-\ndominant firms that would, eventually, end up harming consumers, and competition on the merits ","136":"Rather,  in  applying  either  the  NCT  (most  likely  in  one  of  the  broader  \u2018options\u2019  considered  in  the \nconsultation  \u2013  see  below),  or  ex-ante  regulation  of  the  form  proposed  by  DG  CNECT,  the \nCommission should focus on setting rules of the game in a way that is likely to promote competition, \nrather  than  specifically  targeting  firms  and  conduct,  ex-post,  as  if  it  were  applying  an  instrument \nanalogous  to Article  102 TFEU  (and  stopping  conduct  by  specific  firms  that  may  be  dominant  in \nfuture).   ","137":"Oligopoly markets are pervasive across many sectors of the economy. In such markets there are \nrelatively small numbers of firms who are interdependent and can each, to some degree, influence \nthe  market  price.  In  recognition  of  these  perceived  interdependencies,  profit-maximising  firms  in \noligopoly  markets  will  rationally  consider  their  rivals\u2019  behaviour  and  anticipated  reactions  when \nsetting  prices  and  other  competitive  variables.  When  there  is  repeated  interaction  over  time, \noligopolists may sustain supra-competitive prices.  ","138":"The above situations may present superficially similar outcomes: a few firms, little price-cutting and \nweak competition \u2013 but they are very different in economic terms and are likely to require different \nremedies.  The  first  \u2018market\u2019  could  almost  be  characterised  as  several  separate  markets:  each \nsupplier behaves independently, perhaps because of customer inertia, technological lock-in or poor \ncustomer information. In the second and third scenario, oligopoly results in collusive outcomes even \nthough participants\u2019 actions need not infringe Article 101 TFEU. ","139":"5 The Sherman Act in the United States provides for an offence of \u2018attempted monopolisation\u201d, which has been applied by \nthe courts to require anticompetitive conduct undertaken with \u201ca dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.\u201d \nSpectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456 (1993). However, it has also been interpreted to require \u201cspecific \nintent to monopolize.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court has explained that this offence \u201cdirects itself not against conduct which is \ncompetitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.\u201d Id. at 459. As a \nresult, the intent element requires \u201ca specific intent to destroy competition or build monopoly.\u201d Times-Picayune Pub. Co. \nv. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 626 (1953).   ","140":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThese oligopolistic markets may be characterised as not working well, but for very different reasons, \nresulting  in  excessive  pricing. Arguably,  these  firms  can  be  considered  to  have  a  joint  dominant \nposition and to be exploiting it to sustain excessive prices: the conduct potentially falling under Article \n102 TFEU.  However, the same difficulties in establishing when a single dominant firm is engaging \nin  excessive  pricing  are  present  and  indeed  exacerbated  when  considering  excessive  pricing  by \njoint dominant firms. It follows that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are not well suited to address these \ncompetition problems. Indeed, an attempt to legitimise existing antitrust rules to deal with the above \nproblems would stretch both Articles 101 and 102 TFEU beyond their intended limits. This would not \nonly generate significant legal uncertainty (since even non-dominant firms engaging in non-collusive \nbehaviour could be subject to antitrust enforcement),  but  it would also restrict (or worse, punish) \noligopolists\u2019  profit  maximising  conduct,  which,  in  effect,  is  what  drives  the  competitive  process. \nAgain, the chilling effects can be severe.  ","141":"The question then is whether NCT could  help tackle  the problems resulting from competition not \nworking well in tight oligopolies. In our view, provided that the NCT properly identifies and targets \nthe cause of the problem (e.g. tacit collusion and its enabling factors such as barriers to entry) and \nnot  the  consequence  (i.e.  excessive  prices),  one  can  improve  upon  outcomes  in  oligopolistic \nmarkets with appropriate remedies that would not harm competition in unintended ways.      ","142":"Algorithms and AI present a double-edged sword to competitive markets. On the one hand, they can \nenhance competition by facilitating rapid response to changing competitive conditions and customer \ndemand. Enhanced price discovery and dissemination are likely to make markets more efficient and \ncompetitive.  On  the  other  hand,  increased  prevalence  of  algorithms  and AI  may  facilitate  (tacit) \ncollusion and even make explicit cartels more stable.  ","143":"Coordinated effects\/tacit collusion by AI pricing algorithms have received much attention in recent \nacademic literature and policy debates, although we are not aware of any actual studies or cases to \ndate that have found such effects in the real world, as opposed to experimental settings. The concept \nis  not  inherently  different  from  (tacit)  collusion  more  generally.  It  is  sometimes  expressed  as \nautomation of price setting that potentially means that behaviour that could be considered a breach \nof Article 101 TFEU if carried out by humans is not necessarily such a breach. The concerns raised \nover potential collusion using pricing algorithms can be grouped into three scenarios:  ","144":"Contrary to the economic approach, which considers collusion a market outcome, the legal approach \nfocuses on the means used by competitors to achieve such a collusive outcome. Competition laws \ngenerally do not prohibit collusive outcomes as such, but prohibit anti-competitive agreements or \nconcerted practices, or more generally an exchange of information that could facilitate collusion by ","145":"In (a), algorithms merely amplify conduct which is already caught under the current legal \nframework  and  therefore Article  101  TFEU  is  in  principle  capable  of  dealing  with  these \nissues.  The  most  obvious  and  simple  role  of  algorithms  as  facilitators  of  collusion  is  in \nmonitoring competitors\u2019 actions to enforce a collusive agreement. This role may include the \ncollection of information concerning competitors\u2019 business decisions, data screening to look \nfor  any  potential  deviations  and  eventually  the  programming  of  immediate  retaliation. \nAlgorithms may also reduce the cost  of initiating the  collusion  in the first place. Although \nsignalling may be observed virtually in any market, it usually does not come without a cost. \nWhenever a firm increases the price to indicate an intention to collude, if most competitors \ndo not receive the signal or intentionally decide not to react, the signalling firm loses sales \nand profits. This risk might encourage firms to wait for other competitors to signal, eventually \nleading to delay or even failure to coordinate. Algorithms might reduce or even eliminate the \ncost of signalling, by enabling companies to automatically set very fast iterative actions that \ncannot be exploited by consumers, but which can still be read by rivals possessing good \nanalytical algorithms. ","146":"In  (b),  algorithms  also  amplify  conduct  which  is  already  caught  under  the  current  legal \nframework  and  therefore Article  101  TFEU  is  in  principle  capable  of  dealing  with  these \nissues. In particular, the widespread knowledge and use of common pricing algorithms by \ncompetitors  may  have  a  similar  effect  to  information  exchange  in  reducing  strategic \nuncertainty.  Furthermore,  if  competitors  decide  to  delegate  their  pricing  decisions  to  a \ncommon intermediary which provides algorithmic pricing services, this may also result in a \nhub-and-spoke-like  framework  emerging.  The  main  issue  in  the  assessment  of  such \nconduct  is  the  determination  of  the  level  of  knowledge  of  each  company  about  the \nanticompetitive coordination taking place through algorithmic setting. ","147":"In  (c),  algorithms  create  new  risks  related  to  behaviours  not  covered  by  prohibitions  on \nexplicit  collusion.  The  most  complex  and  subtle  way  in  which  algorithms  can  achieve \ncollusive outcomes is through the use of machine learning and deep learning technologies, \nwhich  may  potentially  enable  a  monopoly  outcome  even  without  competitors  explicitly \nprogramming algorithms to do so. In other words, there is the risk that some algorithms with \npowerful predictive capacity, by constantly learning and readapting to the actions of other \nmarket players (who may be human beings or artificial agents themselves), will be able to \ncollude without the need for any human intervention. ","148":"When  considering  the  likelihood  of  this  last  concern  arising  and  \u2018innocuous\u2019  profit-maximising \nalgorithms learning to collude, the nature of price setting in the market is likely to be important. In \nmarkets with very frequent price-setting, the possibilities for experimenting with pricing strategies \nthat collectively can result in collusively high, even monopoly pricing, is greater. Thus, the concern \nis as much with high-frequency pricing as with the AIs\/algorithms as such.6 ","149":"6   Possibly  very  high  frequency.  One  experimental  study,  for  example,  found  algorithmic  collusion  to  emerge  after  an \naverage of 165,000 price-setting periods. This is equivalent to 13,750 years if firms change prices monthly or about 115 \ndays if firms change prices every minute.

","150":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\fTheoretical and experimental models of tacit collusion confirm that frequent interaction is necessary \nfor successful collusion without communication to raise prices. Economists model tacit collusion as \nbeing enforced by the threat of price wars triggered by prices below the collusive level, so the ability \nto monitor and react quickly to rivals\u2019 prices is essential. Frequent interaction enables firms seeking \nto reach tacitly collusive outcomes to punish such \u2018defection\u2019 with price cuts and also to experiment \nby  raising  prices,  without  incurring  large  risks  from  doing  so.  Conversely,  if  rivals  do  not  reduce \nprices, over time, even though they reconsider prices frequently, that builds trust among the colluding \nfirms in one another\u2019s understanding of the \u2018collusion game\u2019 and commitment to it. Higher frequency \nprice-setting makes all of this behaviour more likely, as (perhaps) does price setting across a large \nnumber of different products and markets, as it enables experimentation with pricing patterns on a \nsmall,  low-risk scale. No signalling would need to  be  involved  in  any such outcome, so it seems \nunlikely to be caught by the existing provisions. ","151":"In  summary:  if  an  algorithm  is  designed  to  collude,  as  under  (a)  and  (b)  above,  then  that  is  not \ninherently different from companies giving sales staff instructions not to undercut certain rivals. That \ncould  be  seen  as  a  specific  commitment  to  collusion,  as  a  deliberate  act  by  the  company  to \n(eventually) collude. More problematic is the case (c) when the algorithm has no instructions except \nto maximise profit and \u2018discovers\u2019 tacit collusion by itself through trial and error. This will only occur \nin  markets  with  very  frequent  price  setting.    Some  commentators  have  suggested  that  there  are \nparticular  \u2018patterns\u2019 of behaviour  that could be outlawed  to  make such  outcomes less  likely \u2013 for \nexample, banning the use of rivals\u2019 past pricing data in setting today\u2019s prices. Thus, one of the main \nrisks of algorithms is that they expand the grey area between unlawful explicit collusion and lawful \ntacit  collusion,  where  firms  could  take  steps  to  make  tacit  collusion  more  likely  but  without \nnecessarily  engaging  in  behaviour  that  is  itself  collusive  or  even  (although  this  would  be  more \nborderline) concerted practices.  Such behaviour may be a gap in the existing legislation (although \nas no such cases have been brought, to our knowledge, the question remains untested).  ","152":"A \u2018tipping market\u2019 is one in which, under some circumstances (such as the emergence of a leading \nfirm), normal (non-abusive) market processes can lead to monopolisation. Abusive behaviour can \nalso lead to such monopolisation, but this may be covered by existing competition law (and we briefly \ndiscussed the issues involved in such behaviour by non-dominant suppliers, above).  ","153":"There are several reasons for markets to \u2018tip\u2019 but most relate to some kind of feedback loops. If an \nincreasing number of other users makes a product more attractive to an individual user, then there \nis potential for a runaway effect that leads to monopolisation or near-monopolisation.7 Other factors \nare  also  relevant  for  the  likelihood  of  market  tipping  such  as  economies  of  scale  and  scope; \nintegration of products, services and hardware; behavioural limitations on the part of consumers; \ndifficulty in raising capital; and the importance of brands. ","154":"The  issue  of  \u201ctipping\u201d  is  not  new,  and  it  is  not  limited  to  digital  platforms.  Competition  between \nstandards often results in the market tipping towards a preferred standard (e.g. VHS, DVD, USB-C). \nIt also occurs in financial infrastructure markets and various other markets with significant network \neffects. However, it is often argued that modern platforms are different, and that competition for the \nmarket cannot be counted on, by itself, to solve the problems associated with market tipping. Many \nof the dominant technology companies of the past seemed unassailable but then faced unexpected ","155":"7   Although a market can \u2018tip\u2019 to a structure less extreme than monopoly and still be stable. Some have argued that this is \nthe  case  for  smartphone  operating  systems  (see  Timothy  Bresnahan,  Joe  Orsini,  and  Pai-Ling  Yin,  \u2018Demand \nHeterogeneity, Inframarginal Multihoming, and Platform Market Stability: Mobile Apps\u2019, Stanford University (15 September \n2015)  available  at  <http:\/\/idei.fr\/sites\/default\/files\/IDEI\/documents\/conf\/Internet_2016\/Articles\/yin.pdf>  accessed  7 \nSeptember 2020.)

Today, \nnetwork effects and returns to scale of data appear to be even more entrenched and some markets \nmay be more stable. Moreover, if the next technological revolution arises from artificial intelligence \nand machine learning, then the companies most able to take advantage of it may well be the existing \nlarge companies because of the importance of data for the successful use of these tools. New entry \nmay still be possible in some markets, but this merely raises additional concerns about mergers that \nlead to such entrants being taken over by existing platform providers. ","157":"Timing is crucial if considering intervention in a market that could tip. Because the processes during \nthe \u2018tipping\u2019 phase itself are in some sense \u2018natural\u2019, once the market is in the course of tipping, it \nmay be too late to intervene. So, if it is an action by a supplier that creates the preconditions for \ntipping, then that action will occur before that market becomes monopolised, possibly even before it \nbecomes obvious that it is heading that way. Consequently, regulatory intervention to prevent tipping \nmay need to occur long before a supplier is dominant. Again, this raises questions of practicality: \ncan actions that might lead to undue tipping be identified reliably, in a manner that does not catch \nso many actions as effectively to deter normal and innovative behaviour? ","158":"However, there  is  a  more  fundamental question to address: should a competition authority try to \nprevent \u2018tipping\u2019 at all? In most cases, tipping markets are driven by efficiencies. For example, it is \nsimply more efficient to have common standards in many IT and other services and this will often \nbe the outcome of free customer choice. Artificial intervention simply to prevent the growth of market \nshares could therefore result in inefficient outcomes (which may be better or worse for consumers \nthan monopoly, depending on the effects of the residual competition in the inefficient oligopolistic \nmarket). In some cases, it might be possible to identify better remedies, such as those promoting \ninteroperability,  which  may  alter  the  economics  of  the  market  more  fundamentally,  so  that  it  can \nmaintain multiple providers without inefficiency. ","159":"The primary competition concern concerning gatekeepers is that they may be able to leverage their \nmarket power and exclude or foreclose rivals in neighbouring markets, for example through refusal \nto supply or discrimination, both of which are abuses for which dominance is a pre-condition. As the \nCommission\u2019s  description  of  potential  concerns  states,  what  sets  gatekeepers  apart  from  other \nplatforms  (and  simply  dominant  firms)  is  their  ability  to  control  not  just  one  market  but  entire \necosystems of unrelated markets (e.g. an operating system and a streaming service): \u201c[l]arge online \nplatforms  are  able  to  control  increasingly  important  platform  ecosystems  in  the  digital  economy. \nTypically, they feature an ability to connect many businesses with many consumers through their \nservices  that,  in  turn,  allows  them  to  leverage  their  advantages,  such  as  their  access  to  large \namounts  of  data,  from  one  area  of  their  activity  to  improve  or  develop  new  services  in  adjacent \nmarkets. These large online platforms also increasingly bundle a broad range of platforms and other \ndigital services into a seamless, data-driven offer.\u201d Concerns about the gatekeeper role have also \nbeen  expressed  concerning  self-preferencing,  a  form  of  anticompetitive  leveraging  (e.g.  Google \nShopping). ","160":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe Commission\u2019s consultation document refers not only to the existence of gatekeepers but also \nto  their  emergence  as  an  issue  to  be  considered.  The  arguments  around  the  emergence  of \ngatekeepers are closely related to those concerning tipping markets discussed in the previous sub-\nsection. Gatekeepers can emerge and achieve their gatekeeper status due to efficiencies, offering \nattractive products to  users on both sides of the  platform.  Which of several rivals may ultimately \nachieve gatekeeper status cannot usually be easily predicted. The concerns here are very similar to \nthose discussed above in relation to intervening in markets before they tip.  ","161":"\uf0b7  Options 3 and 4 allow the Commission to intervene when a structural problem that cannot \nbe  addressed  through  the  enforcement  of  EU  competition  rules  prevents  a  market  from \nfunctioning  properly,  potentially  imposing  remedies  on  all  market  participants  whether \ndominant or not.  This tool would apply regardless of the industry for Option 3, or limited to \nspecific industries (notably the digital sector) for Option 4. ","162":"Both anti-competitive leveraging itself and foreclosure leading to monopolisation more generally are \nlargely within the scope of existing competition law. For a dominant firm, the conduct will often be \nwithin the scope of Article 102 TFEU. The Commission also considers whether the scope for anti-\ncompetitive  leveraging  from  mergers  and  acquisitions  is  enhanced  under  horizontal,  vertical  or \nconglomerate theories of harm and could block or remedy a merger likely to give rise to a SIEC on \nthose grounds. ","163":"However, existing competition law may occasionally not be able to deal with the underlying causes \nof  the  market  power  or  the  links  between  the  monopolised  and  target  markets  that  make \nmonopolisation, whether through anti-competitive leveraging or otherwise, possible. Remedies in an \nArticle 102 TFEU case (or merger control), being necessarily limited to the dominant firm itself, might \nnot  be  ideal  to  resolve  these  underlying  issues,  which  require  a  market-wide,  quasi-regulatory \nsolution.   ","164":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAdditionally,  due  to  limited  administrative  resources,  the  enforcement  of  existing  competition  law \nmay struggle to manage situations where a single dominant firm pursues multiple distinct leveraging \nor monopolisation strategies. This often results in the opening of multiple antitrust investigations in \nparallel  (e.g.  Qualcomm  (Predation,  Exclusivity),  Google  (Shopping,  Adsense,  Android),  Apple \n(Music Streaming, Audiobooks) which may be in some way related in terms of the strategy pursued \nby the dominant firm, but where differences in the alleged anticompetitive objective pursued require \nseparate investigations to be opened, which may create a strain on resources and limits investigative \nefficiency. ","165":"Furthermore,  similar  conduct  at  different  times  could  give  rise  to  repeated  investigations.  We \nunderstand that the Commission may have concerns about repeated leveraging, against which an \ninstrument  such  as Article  102  TFEU,  focused  on  specific  conduct,  might  not  be  effective.    The \nCommission might find and penalise, a dominant firm abusing its strong platform to leverage into \none  market,  for  example,  without  this  necessarily  preventing  subsequent  leveraging  into  other \nmarkets (and much of the concern about large digital platforms is the ubiquity of their relevance to \nmany different markets).  This could point in favour of the use of a new tool that has a broader focus.   ","166":"However,  it  is  worth  noting  again  that  leveraging  can  have  pro-competitive  or  anti-competitive \neffects,  so  a  case-based  approach  often  will  be  more  appropriate,  especially  compared  to  some \nblanket prohibition on certain types of conduct by a platform owner.  If recent leveraging precedents \nwere taken as a broad prohibition on product integration, there would be an overdeterrence of pro-\ncompetitive leveraging strategies.  ","167":"Furthermore, Article 102 TFEU allows for financial penalties, which are intended to have a deterrent \neffect,  while  the  new  tool  would  be  more  focused  on  remedial  action.  A  tough  stance  in  the \napplication  of  Article  102  TFEU  could  therefore  provide  better  reassurance  against  future  anti-\ncompetitive leveraging by a dominant firm than would broad-based remedies with wider effects than \nthe specific markets affected by leveraging.  If existing deterrence is seen as ineffective, this might \nsimply reflect the difficulty of clearly distinguishing, in broad terms, where leveraging is likely to be \nanticompetitive, and where it is likely to be pro-competitive. In light of these ambiguous effects, it \nmay be harmful to platform innovation to address leveraging concerns using a broad-brush approach \nunder the NCT. ","168":"Options 1 and 2 would enable the Commission to intervene generally against dominant firms, with \na potentially broader scope for intervention than existing enforcement under Article 102 TFEU, which \nfocuses on abusive strategies which pursue a single objective. Options 1 and 2 may theoretically \nallow the Commission to address multiple distinct leveraging strategies by a single dominant firm in \none procedure.  ","169":"Generally, the assessment of leveraging as conduct that can potentially breach Article 102 TFEU \nrequires consideration of effects. It is however far from clear how multiple strategies, which may be \nin  a  form  similar  but  whose  effects  may  be  different,  can  be  evaluated.  Each  of  the  types  of \nleveraging  considered  can  have  both  pro-competitive  and  anti-competitive  effects.  It  would,  self-\nevidently, be absurd to prohibit the conduct of \u2018bundling\u2019 in itself, as almost every product or service \nis in some sense a bundle of component products and services. This applies to dominant firms as \nmuch as to non-dominant ones.  ","170":"Accordingly, if the focus of an investigation of a leveraging concern is a dominant firm engaged in \nleveraging,  it  is  hard  to  see  how  a  tool  with  a  lower  threshold  for  intervention  could  be  more \nappropriate  than  the  existing  Article  102  TFEU.  Leveraging  and  bundling  concerns  are  core \nconcerns for Article 102 TFEU, so if the threshold for intervention against them needs to be lower, ","171":"Similarly, it is hard to see that a new tool, with a lower threshold for intervention, would be the right \napproach  to  dealing  with  monopolisation  through  other  means  by  dominant  firms  that  are  not \ncurrently prohibited by Article 102 TFEU. Monopolisation itself is a rather extreme outcome of abuse \nof dominance, so if there are any such situations not currently prohibited, this is presumably because \nthey  involve  conduct  that  is  not  normally  considered  abusive,  but  which  nonetheless  leads  to \nforeclosure of rivals and thus monopolisation. If Article 102 TFEU does not capture such conduct, \nthe obvious solution is to place more emphasis on effects within the assessment of Article 102 TFEU \ncases, rather than either (a) to add additional specific forms of conduct to a form-based prohibition \nor (b) introduce a new instrument. ","172":"Network effects can also create barriers to entry and switching, as when users would be \nreluctant to use a service for which their existing social network contacts are not existing \nusers. Compatibility between networks and data portability can provide a solution but, again, \nwhile these are often primarily the responsibility of a dominant firm, a market-wide solution \nmay be better. ","173":"In both cases, a market-wide remedy, not limited to any dominant firms as would be the case under \nArticle 102 TFEU, can be more complete in its effects and also allow market-wide standards other \nthan those of any existing dominant firm, forced to open its platform. It could also be more resilient \nto  technological  or  market  changes:  dealing  with  the  potential  emergence  of  new  leading  firms \nwithout needing to subject them to a new investigation. ","174":"This should not be seen as an alternative way of investigating conduct by a specific firm.  Rather, \nsuch market-wide remedies are more akin to ex-ante regulation, in that they should aim to promote \ncompetition by setting the rules of the game, rather than correcting the behaviour of individual firms \nseen as abusive.  Their value is likely to arise more from forward-looking prevention of future conduct \nthan correcting specific wrongs.   As such, although  the market-wide  options 3  and 4 for the new \ncompetition tool may be able to produce such benefits, so might the ex-ante tool (focused on digital \nmarkets) proposed by DG Connect.  ","175":"In short, in general, the existing framework of competition law is likely to be adequate to deal with \ntraditional concerns about leveraging and monopolisation conduct by specified firms. However, there \nwill  be  occasions  when  a  market-wide  remedy  can  establish  a  more  pro-competitive  market \nenvironment for the future. The new tool could be useful in such cases. However, we note that other \nmechanisms,  such  as  the  voluntary  agreement  of  standards  between  non-dominant  market \nparticipants following a finding of abuse of dominance against a platform owner, might also achieve \nsuch ends, as might the proposed ex-ante tool for digital markets. ","176":"Whether existing antitrust rules are sufficient to deal with the Commission\u2019s concerns concerning \noligopoly and tacit collusion depends on how broad those concerns are. Some forms of collusion \nthat fall short of explicit communication can nonetheless in principle be caught by Article 101 TFEU \n(to the extent there are concerted practices which lead to parallel conduct). Indeed, this may apply \neven to novel forms of collusion such as through algorithmic\/AI pricing, if the competition authorities \ncan identify features of the algorithm\u2019s design that seem intended to facilitate collusion. Such pricing \ndoes  not  inherently  raise  any  new  issues  for  competition  authorities  in  identifying  collusive \nbehaviour. If a supplier has designed a pricing algorithm\u2019s workings or goals in a way that seems \nlikely  to  give  rise  to  collusive  outcomes,  then  arguably  that  decision  could  be  assessed  as  a \nconcerted practice, even if the pricing \u2018decisions\u2019 themselves are not the conscious actions of the \nfirm as a whole. ","177":"However, if the Commission believes it is necessary to take action against pure tacit collusion, or \nthe conditions that cause it, in any market in which the effect is super-normal pricing, then Article \n101 TFEU  does  not  enable  intervention  where  there  is  no  agreement  or  concerted  practice.  For \nexample, in some industries prices may \u2018naturally\u2019 be transparent, as in various online markets in \nwhich competitors can easily learn about their competitors\u2019 pricing in real-time. In other industries, \nprices  might  be  much  harder  to  observe  accurately  or  on  time.  It  may  be  possible  to  assess  a \nscheme for publishing prices in the second kind of industry as a possible concerted practice under \nArticle  101  TFEU,  as  it  might  be  intended  to  facilitate  collusion.  However,  it  might  not  suit  the \nCommission\u2019s purposes only to be able to take action in such a market but not in the former market \nin which prices are naturally transparent. To do so would require a tool focused on tacitly collusive \noutcomes, as such, not specific conduct. ","178":"By definition, oligopoly necessarily involves more than one firm (unlike monopoly) and an outcome \nwhich  is  significantly  affected  by  the  behaviour  of  individual  firms  within  the  market  (unlike  a \nreasonably competitive market). Consequently, whether the concern is with tacit collusion or other \noligopolistic interaction, a dominance-based tool would appear to be wholly unsuitable. First, there \nis no guarantee that any of the firms in the market will be dominant. Second, even if there were, an \ninvestigation and any remedies focused  on  only a  dominant  participant would  not be effective or \nparticularly  meaningful.  Even  if  the  dominant  participant\u2019s  behaviour  changed,  that  would  not \nnecessarily  change  the  behaviour  of  other  participants  or  remove  the  underlying  conditions  that \nmade such behaviour possible. ","179":"It  is  in  the  area  of  oligopoly  that  a  new  market-wide  tool  potentially  adds  the  most  to  the \nCommission\u2019s existing instruments. There is no obvious way to interpret Article 102 TFEU to cover \nsituations in which an oligopoly acts in a manner that is against the interests of consumers, in the \nform of a \u2018collective dominance excessive pricing\u2019 case. An alternative, building on Article 101 TFEU, \nwould be a tool which could deal with pure tacit collusion, without any evidence of an agreement or \nconcerted practice.   ","180":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fHowever, we understand that the Commission\u2019s concern may also be broader, covering markets in \nwhich \u2018competition does not work well\u2019, to use a phrase that has sometimes been used to describe \nthe focus of the UK\u2019s existing market investigation regime. In such markets, the outcomes reflecting \na  lack  of  effective  competition  might  arise  from  behaviour  that  is  a  rational  response  to  market \nconditions. In those situations, no prohibited conduct could be identified. So, a market-based tool \nthat is intended to deal with \u2018features of the market that could have an adverse effect on competition\u2019 \n(to use wording from the UK legislation) may be more effective than any of the Commission\u2019s existing \ntools.    That  would  cover  features  that  could  give  rise  to  tacit  collusion.    However,  it  could  also \nencompass  a  wide  range  of  conditions,  many  of  which  are  more  closely  related  to  consumer \nprotection policy than to competition policy, which we do not believe should be within the scope of \nthe NCT as we discuss in Section 4.1. ","181":"This type of broad-based instrument could cover a wide range of possible market conditions, as the \nCMA\u2019s track record in the UK demonstrates. While an individual discussion of each possible scenario \nis beyond the scope of this paper, we  set out below a number of general points that should be taken \ninto  account  in  order  to  ensure  that  any  such  tool  is    effective  in  addressing  markets  with  weak \ncompetition while leaving be those markets in which competition works reasonably well: ","182":"Any assessment of excessive pricing and profits needs to be conducted with a significant \nmargin allowing for prices to be \u2018high\u2019 and profits too, on most occasions, without attracting \nregulatory  intervention.  The  existing  prohibition  on  excessive  pricing  has  rightly  been \napplied,  with  caution,  only  to  cases  in  which  prices  bear  \u2018no  reasonable  relation\u2019  to \ncompetitive benchmarks and of course it can only be applied to dominant firms. A tool with \na  lower  threshold  for  intervention,  that  could  in  principle  impose  price  controls  or  other \nremedies in any markets, wherever the Commission detected prices higher than it thought \nright  would  substitute  the  Commission\u2019s  opinion  for  that  of  the  market,  and  lead  to  an \nexcessive degree of state intervention, chilling innovation, investment and risk-taking. ","183":"An adverse finding (of problems within an oligopolistic market) should be assessed against \na well-defined counterfactual. If, for example, the Commission finds that market participants \ncould compete harder against one another, it needs to be able to describe clearly what that \nwould look like and demonstrate with evidence what the effects would be. For example, it \nwould not make sense in a market in which fixed costs of operation were high, to assert that \nprices would be lower and consumers better off, were there simply more competitors if that \nis not compatible with fixed cost recovery.  The counterfactual should be restricted to the set \nof feasible market conditions and not include purely fanciful alternative circumstances.  One \nway to do that is to restrict the counterfactual to conditions that could be brought about by \nrealistic remedies, as we now discuss. ","184":"Any such investigation must involve consideration of feasible remedies, from the start (and \nbefore the start). If, for example, the Commission finds that a market is characterised by \ntacit collusion, it should be prepared to impose remedies that somehow change the ability \nof  incentives  of  market  participants  to  collude  (for  example  by  reducing  barriers  to  entry, \nprohibiting certain price transparency practices and so on). Investigating to find and apply \nsanctions  to  participants  is  not  appropriate,  for  a  market-wide  instrument  (and  it  is  not \nparticipants\u2019 behaviour that is the primary focus). We would suggest that if the Commission \ndoes  not  believe  it  can  remedy  the  underlying  causes  of  some  weakness  in  competition \n(tacit  collusion  or  otherwise)  it  should  be  very  reluctant  to  intervene,  as  the  most  likely \noutcome is price control \u2013 which has great potential for economic harm. ","185":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fframework (where no change would be required) and algorithms which increase the risk of tacitly \ncollusive outcomes,  while  not  infringing current rules, as we discussed in  Section 2.   As we  also \nnoted there, the concerns about the second case are still very speculative. We are not aware of any \nspecific  concerns  that  a  competition  authority  has  expressed  about  algorithmic  pricing  and  been \nunable to take action under current laws, so it cannot be regarded as proven that new instruments \nare required to deal with this hypothetical concern.  ","186":"\u201cGatekeeper\u201d scenarios and \u201ctipping\u201d markets are concepts which are familiar in the enforcement of \nArticle 102 TFEU. However, these concerns may also relate to non-dominant firms which fall outside \nthe  scope  of Article  102  TFEU,  as  discussed  above.    In  general,  the  difficulties  in  dealing  with \ngatekeeper scenarios and tipping markets relate to identifying the right moment  and right way to \nintervene.  When the concern stems from action by an existing dominant firm, such as a dominant \nplatform  owner  restricting  access  or  otherwise  using  unfair  advantages  to  stifle  competitors  in  a \nnascent  market,  existing  competition  tools  are  likely  to  be  adequate  to  the  task  in  principle.8  \nHowever, such nascent markets often  need  quicker intervention if any abuse is to be addressed \nswiftly  enough  to  preserve  competition,  before  the  market  tips  (and,  for  example,  adopts \ncompatibility with the dominant platform, as a de facto standard).  There may therefore be a gap that \na new tool could fill, even in dealing with cases where Article 102 TFEU could apply. ","187":"However, the more likely use of the new tool, as discussed above, is to deal with situations where \nmarkets tip not as the result of anti-competitive conduct by a dominant firm but as a result of conduct \n(or the existence of market features) that do not constitute abusive behaviour, by a dominant firm.  \nSimilarly, there may be situations of anti-competitive behaviour (or, again, innocuous behaviour that \nnonetheless leads to inefficient monopolisation) by a firm that is not dominant (or not dominant yet).   \nExisting tools are clearly not designed or suitable to deal with such situations; so, a broader pro-\ncompetitive means of intervention would be needed. ","188":"A dominance-based tool could potentially allow the Commission to intervene to prevent a dominant \nfirm taking action to induce nascent markets to \u2018tip\u2019 in its favour, and\/or to prevent a dominant firm \nfrom achieving gatekeeper status. The tool could therefore be used in particular to address concerns \nthat dominant platforms could engage in conduct that might not in itself be considered abusive under \nArticle 102 TFEU but could nonetheless cause markets to \u2018tip\u2019 to extend that firm\u2019s dominance to \nnew markets. ","189":"A  dominance-based  tool  would  only  be  appropriate  if  the  Commission  believed  (a)  there  are \npotentially many such cases in  which such  behaviour by dominant firms  would  not  be caught by \nexisting competition law (or, due to limited administrative resources, competition enforcement) and \n(b) there are few such cases which would require a broader-based tool that can also be applied to \nnon-dominant firms. ","190":"8   Some commentators argue that identifying dominance in platform markets is often difficult.  For example, assessing the \nability  to  price  independently  of  competitive constraints  can  be more  complex in  two-sided  markets than  in  traditional \nmarkets.  However, this does not seem to us to be a valid reason to drop the dominance requirement, as it reflects ways \nin which platforms genuinely might differ from such traditional markets and the reason it is hard to establish dominance is \noften  that  there  are  additional  reasons  why  dominance  may  not  be  present.    It  is  important  properly  to  assess  those \nadditional reasons, not simply ignore them.  ","191":"The use of an investigative tool in such situations, however, implies that the Commission would be \nconsidering them on a case-by-case basis. It may be that identifying which markets could tip and \nhow (and when and to whom) is too difficult for this to be a reliable exercise. If so, some broader-\nbrush prohibitions that might be  better-applied  ex-ante by a regulatory instrument could be more \neffective.  ","192":"Again, we note that the Commission should not assume that a market\u2019s tipping is necessarily a bad \noutcome, even if it reinforces the dominance of an existing platform provider. This could be the most \nefficient outcome of competition and it could be harmful to impose artificial prohibitions seeking to \nsustain two or more providers, or preventing genuine synergies emerging from the platform owner \nextending its activities to other markets.  ","193":"The arguments for intervening to prevent the emergence of gatekeeper status are closely related to \nthose  just  discussed  in  connection  with  tipping. The  emergence  of  a  firm  with  gatekeeper  status \ncould also be an efficient outcome of the competitive process.  Attempting to predict whether and \nhow to intervene to prevent the emergence of a gatekeeper could deter innovation or be prone to \nregulatory errors. ","194":"If  a  firm  is  already  a  gatekeeper,  competition  concerns  relate  to  anticompetitive  foreclosure  and \ndiscrimination  and  are  closely  linked  to  those  discussed  above  in  relation  to  leveraging.  For  the \nreasons  above,  relaxing  the  threshold  for  intervention  in  Article  102  TFEU  cases  seems  more \nappropriately a matter for the Courts\u2019 interpretation of Article 102 TFEU or, indeed, reform of Article \n102 TFEU itself rather than justifying the introduction of a new competition tool expressly for this \npurpose. ","195":"As discussed above, we think it quite possible that action against dominant platform owners could \nhelp prevent markets from tipping unduly or to reinforce an existing dominant position, or to prevent \na firm from becoming a gatekeeper. We also noted that an ex-ante regulatory tool might be more \neffective and also that markets will sometimes tip in a manner that is in the interests of consumers, \neven if it reinforces an already dominant platform owner. ","196":"A  broader  market-based  tool  has  in  principle  two  advantages  over  the  dominance-based  tools \nconsidered  earlier.  First,  it  could  apply  to  prevent  tipping  to  an  existing,  non-dominant  firm.  We \nsuspect this would only rarely be useful. Its application would amount to picking (and trying to stop) \nwinners, which seems unlikely to be effective or economically efficient. Second, the remedies can \nbe market-wide. This seems more likely to be useful, particularly in cases in which the remedies can \ndo  more  than  simply  resist  the  economic  forces  leading  to  tipping,  but  instead  remove  them \naltogether.  For  example,  compatibility  between  different  systems  can  reduce  or  eliminate  the \nnetwork effects that give rise to tipping. For example, if content can only be edited with a certain \nsoftware package then the market may tip to that product; if many software packages can effectively \nedit the same file, then the pressure to tip is much reduced.  ","197":"At what point is a market sufficiently in danger of tipping to allow for intervention below the \nthreshold of dominance?  Network effects matter in terms of strength, symmetry,  whether \nthey are direct and\/or indirect, and at what critical mass they begin to develop. The value \nand frequency of transactions also determine how likely users are to multi-home or switch \nplatforms. These factors can serve as a starting point for assessing platform competition, \nbut market-specific circumstances (such as behavioural biases) may also be important. ","198":"How  can  actions  that  favour  tipping  be  distinguished  from  desirable  (albeit  aggressive) \ncompetition on aspects such as quality or price? Some economists suggest that one way to \nidentify an anticompetitive practice is to consider whether it is profitable only if a monopoly \nposition is achieved in the long term (in line with the usual test for predation in proceedings \nagainst  abuse  of  dominance).  However,  they  acknowledge  that  some  practices  may  be \nanticompetitive without being based on predation and that it is difficult to draw a clear line \nbetween the two. ","199":"From an economic perspective, the proposed intervention would make a difference in markets where \nfirm behaviour can be pivotal in making the market tip. As such, it is important to get the balance in \nenforcement right. Over-enforcement could be particularly harmful if additional rules on platforms in \nmarkets  that  are  unlikely  to  tip  prevented  firms  from  competing  vigorously  with  each  other,  or  if \nstrategies that primarily enhance consumer welfare were mistaken for anticompetitive behaviour. It \nmay be particularly hard to distinguish actions leading to vigorous competition from those causing \ntipping and monopolisation in nascent markets, so intervention should be undertaken with caution. ","200":"As  noted  above,  the  Commission\u2019s  proposed  platform-specific  ex-ante  regulation  seems  a \npotentially attractive way to address some of the underlying causes that may give rise to gatekeeper \nstatus or prevent the emergence of strong rivals to the gatekeeper. For example, if the status arises \nfrom access to specific forms of data, then this lends itself to a regulatory ex-ante solution to enable \nqualifying firms to access that specific data.  ","201":"In  cases  where  it  is  too  late  for  ex-ante  regulation  to  play  a  role,  then  a  market  structure-based \ncompetition  tool  may  have  a  role  to  play  \u2013  for  example,  to  implement  remedies  relating  to \ninteroperability  or  guidelines  to  facilitate  competition  in  neighbouring  markets.  Once  again,  the \nquestion  of  which  tool  is  more  appropriate  comes  down  to  whether  the  remedies  that  may  be \nrequired are market-wide or firm-specific, with market-wide remedies supporting the introduction of \nan NCT. ","202":"Above, we evaluated the effectiveness of existing and prospective new instruments in dealing with \neach of the various concerns the Commission has identified. We concluded that there are a number \nof  potential  gaps  in  existing  competition  law  that  could  be  addressed  with  an  NCT  focused  on \npromoting competition, rather than dealing solely with anti-competitive conduct.  We considered two \nbroad areas of concern. ","203":"If the focus of an investigation is unilateral conduct of a specific dominant firm, it is hard to see how \na new dominance-based tool with a lower threshold for intervention (Options 1 and 2) could be more \nappropriate than the existing Article 102 TFEU. The conduct of dominant firms is a core concern for \nArticle 102 TFEU, so if the threshold for intervention needs to be lower, that is an argument for the \ninterpretation  of Article  102  TFEU  itself  (or  indeed  theoretically  its  reform),  not  for  introducing  a \nparallel instrument. If there is any conduct not currently prohibited, this is presumably because such \nconduct is not normally considered abusive, even if it can lead to anti-competitive effects. If Article \n102 TFEU does not capture such conduct, the obvious solution is to place more emphasis on effects \nwithin the assessment of Article 102 TFEU cases, rather than either to add additional specific forms \nof conduct to a form-based prohibition or introduce a new instrument. ","204":"A market-based tool (Options 3 and 4) could prove useful in some instances, even when the concern \nis with the conduct of a dominant firm.  Market-wide remedies that are not limited to the dominant \nfirm  (as  would  necessarily  be  the  case  under Article  102  TFEU)  can  be  more  complete  in  their \neffects. Such remedies could also be more resilient to technological or market changes: dealing with \nthe potential emergence of new leading firms without needing to subject them to a new investigation.  ","205":"If  the  focus  of  an  investigation  is  a  structural  problem  that  prevents  a  market  from  functioning \nproperly, any kind of dominance-based tool \u2013 Article 102 TFEU or the new Options 1 and 2 - seems \nwholly unsuitable. First, there is no guarantee that any of the firms in the market will be dominant. \nSecond,  even  if  there  were,  an  investigation  and  any  remedies  focused  on  only  a  dominant \nparticipant  would  not  be  effective  or  particularly  meaningful.  Even  if  the  dominant  participant\u2019s \nbehaviour changed, that would not necessarily change the behaviour of other participants or remove \nthe underlying conditions that made such behaviour possible. ","206":"A market-based tool (Options 3 and 4) that is intended to deal with features of the market that could \nhave an adverse effect on competition may therefore be more effective than any of the Commission\u2019s \nexisting tools. A broader market-based tool has in principle two advantages over a dominance-based \ntool. First, it could apply to prevent anti-competitive conduct by an existing, non-dominant firm. We \nsuspect this would only rarely be useful. Its application would carry a significant risk of error. Second, \nthe remedies available within such a tool can be market-wide. This seems more likely to be useful, \nparticularly in cases in which the remedies can do more than simply treat the symptoms of weak \ncompetition, but instead remove the causes altogether. ","207":"Options 1 and 2, therefore, seem to add little to the existing instruments of competition law and, if \nthey exist alongside those instruments, could result in confusion or even double jeopardy in a way \nthat  is  more  likely  to  produce  economic  harm  than  good.    Furthermore,  they  are  unsuitable  for \ndealing with the most significant gaps in the current enforcement toolkit.   ","208":"We have not considered at length the distinction  between  a tool  that can  be  used in any  market \n(Option 3) and one targeted on specific markets (Option 4).  As a practical matter, it seems to us \nlikely to be very difficult to define in advance the scope of the Option 4 tool and the markets to which \nit is applicable.  For example, many of the concerns relate to digital markets, but these days it is \nvery hard to define what  might (or might not) constitute a  \u2018digital market\u2019.   Structural competition \nproblems  could  also  potentially  materialise  in  virtually  any  industry  which  possesses  certain \ncharacteristics such as barriers to entry, customer lock-in, etc ","209":"Having identified a preference for the broadest of the new instruments under consideration by the \nCommission,  an  important  question  falls  to  be  addressed:  what  are  the  outer  limits  of  a  market-\nstructure  based  tool?  While  one  could  presumably  identify  a  wide  variety  of  market  failures  and \ndysfunctional markets, it does not always follow that the solution is more competition. The tool is \nintended  to  be  a  competition  instrument:  it  deals  with  failures  of  competition;  with  situations  that \nwould be solved if only competition were more effective. The NCT is not a magic bullet and there \nmust be outer limits to the tool, that is, problems which it is not designed to fix. With that in mind, we \ndiscuss two important limitations of the NCT below. ","210":"We do not think that the Commission should wield a \u2018market failure tool\u2019, conferring the ability to \nintervene in markets wherever it believes they are working poorly, for any reason.  Instead, the scope \nshould be limited to the (already broad) range of competition concerns outlined above.  Markets can \nfail for  many reasons, including  informational problems and consumer behavioural  limitations,  as \nwell  as  problems  of  externalities  such  as  environmental  concerns.    One  could  often  imagine  the \nworld sufficiently different as to consider that \u2018if only\u2019 competition could work, then the market failure \nwould be addressed, but this does not mean that in practice every market failure is a competition \nproblem.  For example, environmental issues can in principle be solved by the proper allocation of \nproperty rights and establishing markets, but this does not mean that this is the only solution or the \nbest  solution  (considering  distributional  and  other  political  issues)  to  the  problem,  nor  that  it  is  a \nproblem for DG Competition. ","211":"To this end, we believe that the NCT should focus solely on competition policy and should exclude \nother policy objectives, notably consumer policy. Whereas competition policy is concerned with the \nprotection of the integrity of the competitive process, and thus indirectly the welfare of consumers, \nconsumer  policy  is  designed  to  directly  address  negative  outcomes  for  consumers.  In  practical \nterms, this would mean that if the NCT is intended as a competition policy tool, that is to improve the \ncompetitive process, it should address structural competition problems where the supply side is the \nsource of the issue. In other words, it should exclude issues stemming from the demand side which \ndo not relate to or affect the efficacy of the competitive process on the supply side.  ","212":"That said, the boundary between supply-side and demand-side issues is sometimes blurred. Stucke \nand Ezrachi have made compelling arguments about how demand-side issues can undermine the \nvalue of the competitive process itself.9 For example, while the internet has brought almost unlimited \naccess to information, consumers nevertheless have limited capacity and willpower to process all \nthis information. Therefore, they tend to seek heuristic information cues to simplify their decisions, \nfor instance, favouring extreme positive or negative ratings as more useful than moderate ratings,10 \nor  -  where  decisions  are  too  complex  -  sticking  with  the  status  quo.11  In  the  presence  of  these ","213":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fconsumer biases harm may occur where instead of competing on quality, firms compete to exploit \nthese biases. Firms may, for example, adopt strategies targeted at artificially inflating product ratings \ninstead  of  making  genuine  efforts  to  improve  product  quality.  Alternatively,  firms  may  seek  to \nincrease the complexity of decisions, making it more difficult for consumers to compare price and \nquality and choose the product that matches their preferences.12 Whether competition policy is the \nright  tool  to  address  these  issues  depends  on  whether  there  is  a  problem  with  the  competitive \nprocess,  and  whether  this  can  be  successfully  addressed  by  intervening  to  fix  the  competitive \nprocess. On the other hand, if the intervention can only be truly successful if it directly addresses \nthe negative outcomes for consumers (e.g. by price regulation) then competition policy is unlikely to \nbe  the  correct  instrument.  In  other  words,  competition  policy  should  not  be  concerned  with \nsymptomatic or palliative treatment. Nor should competition be viewed as a cure-all, or an end unto \nitself: we must recognize that competition can be a tool to improve welfare but that we cannot solve \nall market failures by introducing competition. ","214":"Accordingly, we believe that the scope of application of any new tool should be limited to concerns \nthat  are  typically  and  widely  recognised  as  competition  problems  as  opposed  to,  for  example, \nconsumer protection problems. This may well rule out addressing certain markets where competition \nis weak because of consumer behavioural issues. We pick on this case because it is difficult and \nborderline.  Companies might exploit customer ignorance or unwillingness to consider alternatives, \nto create market power, they might also deliberately seek to increase those customer behaviours to \nentrench their market positions.  In some cases, those will indeed be valid competition concerns (for \nexample, because a prohibition on such conduct by the firms, or structural change in the market, \nmight improve the situation).13  In other cases, however, the sole cause of the problem might be \nconsumer  behaviour  itself,  in  which  case  remedies  would  focus  largely  on  educating  customers, \nchanging  that  behaviour  or  helping  with,  for  example,  defaults  and  \u2018nudges\u2019.    The  latter  type  of \ninvestigation does not seem to us to be within the scope of competition policy or the mandate of DG \nCompetition. It is more properly a matter of sectoral regulation and consumer policy. ","215":"The  Commission  is  well  equipped  to  deal  with  competition  policy,  supported  by  significant \ninstitutional experience and a well-understood policy objective. On the other hand, if the NCT were \nto  expand  into  consumer  policy,  the  Commission  would  be  in  relatively  unchartered  waters. \nFurthermore, were the NCT to pursue (at least) a dual mandate of competition policy and consumer \npolicy the Commission would be faced with the task of complex regulatory trade-offs between the \ntwo. These would of course only occur in \u201chard\u201d cases. However, the Commission would in such \ncircumstances  risk  making  decisions  concerning  issues  of  market  efficiency  vs.  \u201cfair\u201d  economic \ndistribution  within  and  between  the  Member  States.  These  decisions  are  generally  better  left  to \npoliticians  and  legislators  and  would  undermine  the  hard-won  support  for  the  EU\u2019s  competition \npolicy.  ","216":"The UK\u2019s market investigation regime illustrates the  difficulties  of  a market  investigation tool that \npursues  both  competition  policy  and  consumer  policy  objectives.  The  CMA\u2019s  energy  market \ninvestigation struggled with the broad issue of weak customer response and lack of engagement \nwith the domestic retail energy market. To address this problem, the CMA was forced to consider a ","217":"We, therefore, suggest that the Commission conveys - both through the design of the new tool and \nalso  through  guidelines  and  eventually  case  practice  -  that  it  is  intended  to  remedy  competition \nfailures, by promoting competition, not to deal with market failures in general and especially not to \nprovide an additional instrument of consumer policy. ","218":"Another important consideration is whether and how the NCT will manage situations in the public \nsector  or  where  there  are  public  interest  considerations  (as  envisaged  under  Question  30  of  the \nConsultation). In the UK, the CMA can, for example, address market failures which stem from the \npublic sector as well as the private sector and has in the past identified markets (e.g. Energy) where \nregulation was hampering the effective functioning of the market.  The question of whether the NCT \nshould address market failures which result from, or are impacted by, regulation or decisions of the \nState involves both policy and legal considerations.  ","219":"In  principle,  there  are  two  questions  here:  whether  the  NCT  should  concern  itself  with  public \nobjectives other than competition and whether remedial action taken under the new powers should \nencompass laws, regulation or other state action.  The two are linked because a regulation that has \nan anticompetitive effect (that a Commission investigation might identify as an underlying cause of \nsome competition problem) has presumably been put in place by some public body in furtherance \nof some public purpose.  If the  Commission were  empowered to remove such regulation, then  it \nwould be necessary for it to assess whether the importance of the regulation in promoting that public \npurpose outweighs any malign effects on competition. ","220":"From a policy perspective, balancing conflicting laws may be relatively straightforward where they \npursue  similar  values,  such  as  economic  efficiency  (e.g.  as  antitrust  shares  with  sector  access \nregulation), but where they pursue different goals (e.g. sustainability, safety) it becomes difficult for \na single institution to find the optimal balance. Similarly, it seems to us that in its role as competition \nenforcer, the Commission should focus only on competition goals in assessing conduct (public or \nprivate)  when  developing  the  new  tool.    Having  multiple  goals  would  not  only  detract  from  the \nCommission\u2019s main focus but also involves value judgments of incommensurate goals.  In general, \nit is a sound principle of economic policy that a single policy goal should have one instrument to \npromote it, and problems of effectiveness, as well as legitimacy, can arise when an instrument aims \nto promote multiple social objectives.15  Of course, some valued objective such as privacy can be \nharmed  through  a  failure  of  competition  \u2013  but  equally,  that  objective  can  be  harmed  for  reasons \nentirely unrelated to competition.  If the concern is really about privacy, it would be perverse to act \non harm to privacy when it arises from failures of competition but not from other causes. For all of \nthese  reasons,  we  believe  the  scope  of  the  new  competition  tool  should  be  limited  to  economic, \ncompetition  objectives,  particularly  the  consumer  welfare  standard  defined  narrowly  in  material \nterms.  ","221":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fresult of regulations or other state action.  On the contrary, the European economy is likely to suffer \nas least as much from such anti-competitive regulation as from anti-competitive private conduct.  It \nis a sound principle in a competition investigation to identify regulatory action that may be causing \nthe problem, but then instead of assessing whether the competition problem outweighs the social \npurpose behind the regulation, to seek to identify less anti-competitive ways of achieving that social \npurpose.16  For example, concerns to ensure professional standards are maintained in pharmacy or \nother  markets  concerned  with  health  do  not  necessarily  require  restrictions  on  ownership  that \nprevent the emergence of pharmacy chains, which can be highly pro-competitive.   ","222":"Nevertheless,  the  Commission  may  also  have  to  be  circumspect  about  direct  intervention  where \nthere  are  non-economic  considerations  at  play,  which  indicates  that  recommendations  to  the \nlegislator  may  be  more  appropriate  than  mandating  something  which  conflicts  with  existing \nregulation.  There  are  also  questions  of  legal  basis  as  regards  direct  intervention  in  the  face  of \nconflicting  national  rules  (rather  than  EU  regulation  or  laws).  On  the  one  hand,  the  Courts  have \nconsistently held that the Member States have a duty under the Treaties to refrain from enacting \nlaws which could prevent the effectiveness of the rules of competition.17 On the other hand, it is less \nclear how NCT decisions would interact with national laws which give rise to features which create \nstructural competition problems. A law which creates a structural competition problem, to the extent \nthat  it  does  not  require  an  infringement  of Articles  101  and  102  TFEU,  would  not  be  inherently \nincompatible with existing EU laws. As such, the Commission will need to think carefully about the \nrelationship between any powers conferred on the Commission in relation to public regulation and \nlaws and both EU and national laws.  ","223":"To summarise, if the objective of the NCT is to fully address \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d, the \nCommission should be able to address concerns regardless of whether they stem from private or \npublic conduct. The NCT should not shy away from these issues, as the underlying causes of many \ncompetition  problems  may  be  state  action.  Nevertheless,  it  may  be  appropriate  that  the \nCommission\u2019s  powers  to  deal  with  these  types  of  problems  are  limited  more  to  identifying  the \nproblems and suggesting less anti-competitive alternatives rather than being directly determinative. ","224":"We have established the appropriateness of a broad-based market tool to deal with the identified \nconcerns in Section 3, and the outer limits of the tool in this Section. However, the effectiveness of \nsuch a tool will critically depend upon designing the system properly. In particular, there would need \nto be a number of important legal safeguards, which we discuss in turn in the remaining sections.  ","225":"The  NCT  consultation  touches  upon  the  need  for  a  \u201csmooth  interaction\u201d  with  sector-specific \nregulation. This is indeed a significant challenge, considering the risks of overlap, tension and direct \nconflict between an open-textured tool such as the NCT and sector-specific regulation that will often \nbe applied by national regulatory authorities. However, there is an equally, if not more pressing need, \nfor consistency of the NCT with the EU\u2019s existing competition policy. ","226":"The NCT poses a challenge in this regard. To some extent, the policy options would overlap with the \nCommission\u2019s existing competition tools: Options 1 and 2 for a \u201cdominance-based\u201d tool would, on \nits face, overlap significantly with Article 102 TFEU while Options 3 and 4 would potentially overlap \nwith both Articles 101 and 102 TFEU as well as covering issues outside their scope (e.g. unilateral ","227":"The existing framework of competition law has developed over the years to ensure robust analysis \nof  effects  on  competition,  and  the  effects  of  doing  away  with  parts  of  that  framework  should  be \ncarefully considered.

However, it is also a crucial part of rigorous \ncompetition analysis, without which there is little frame of reference through which to assess effects \non  competition.

It  also  avoids  the  temptation  for \ncompetition authorities to frame conduct in one way or another in order to apply a legal test with a \nlower threshold for intervention.

Indeed, the costs considered by the Courts in determining the content of antitrust \nprohibitions have typically been the chilling effects on preventing efficient conduct.22 Furthermore, \nremedies carry significant costs irrespective of whether firms can be fined or suffer the stigma of \ninfringement.  The  Commission\u2019s  Impact  Assessment  assumes  that  consumers  will  benefit  from \nintervention under the NCT, and this will outweigh the costs of the remedy implementation.23 This \noverlooks the fact that poorly designed or unnecessary remedies can themselves result in negative \noutcomes  for  consumers  which,  rather  than  counterbalancing,  compounds  the  costs  of  remedy \nimplementation. If there are no limiting principles on the NCT, the resulting legal uncertainty would \nlikely have significant chilling effects on investment and innovation.  ","234":"The lack of \u201cinfringement\u201d or \u201cfines\u201d under the NCT also does not provide a strong legal basis for a \ndifferent (lower) standard to Article 101 and 102 TFEU. In any event, from a practical perspective is \nvery little \u201cgap\u201d between the potential \u201cno-fault\u201d NCT and the existing competition rules as Articles \n101 and 102 TFEU to justify a lower standard for intervention.  Article 101 and 102 TFEU are already \nhighly  flexible  tools  from  a  procedural  perspective  that  already  permit  the  \u201cno-fault\u201d  intervention \npotentially envisaged by the Commission under the NCT. The Commission can, for example, opt to \npursue relatively \u201cnovel\u201d cases and not impose a fine, with the Commission enjoying \u2018a wide margin \nof discretion\u2019  in levying penalties.24 Besides, the Commission may also enter into commitments with \nfirms to address potentially problematic conduct without a finding of either an infringement (or a fine). \nSo, while the use of the commitments procedure is in the hands of the firms under investigation as \nwell as the Commission, it offers a flexible means of intervention commensurate with the gravity of \nthe potential infringement.  ","235":"23  Impact Assessment: \u201c\u2026these remedies would increase costs for the companies concerned. The proportionality of the \ncosts incurred would be ensured by the fact that such remedies have to be limited to ensuring the proper functioning of \nthe market under scrutiny. Consumer benefits deriving from the timely intervention under all policy options should outweigh \nthose costs.\u201d  ","236":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fBy introducing a policy to address conduct and market features that are likely to give rise to structural \ncompetition problems (i.e. intervention so that markets can \u201cself-correct\u201d through improving existing \nmarket mechanisms), the Commission would be able to take remedial action without the need to \nestablish dominance or a concerted practice. Thus, by its very nature, the NCT would presumably \npermit  earlier  intervention  than  would  otherwise  be  permissible  under  the  Commission\u2019s  existing \ncompetition tools.  ","237":"On  the  other  hand,  if  the  goal  is  to  relax  existing  requirements  under  established  case  law,  for \nexample,  the  onerous  refusal  to  supply  standard  or  the  requirement  to  define  markets,  the \nCommission  should  make  these  arguments  before  the  Courts  so  that  they  can  be  resolved  in  a \nmanner  which  is  consistent  with  the  existing  framework  under  the  Treaties.  Moreover,  if  the \nCommission\u2019s principal concern is an inability to complete conventional antitrust cases before the \nharm has occurred, due to administrative inflexibility, it may be that reform of the \u201cinterim measures\u201d \nregime  would  be  a  more  effective  way  to  achieve  this  purpose.25  This  would  allow  for  a  lower \nstandard  for  intervention,  subject  to  the  caveat  that  a  more  complete  analysis  will  ultimately  be \ncompleted and harm, if any, from unnecessary remedies reversed.   ","238":"Depending  on  which  of  the  options  is  adopted,  there  will  be  a  greater  or  less  degree  of  overlap \nbetween the NCT and the existing competition law framework: Options 1 and 2 would result in the \nNCT significantly overlapping with Article 102 TFEU while Options 3 and 4 would partially overlap \nwith both Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (as well as covering a range of additional issues).  ","239":"Given the need for consistency of legal standard applied to the same conduct (i.e. same facts), this \nposes significant difficulties for Options 1 and 2 as their practical utility \u2013 as a form of alternative for \nintervening  against  dominant  firms  \u2013  would  be  limited.  To  this  end,  if  the  Commission  is  firmly \nconvinced that the standard for intervention under Article 102 TFEU is too high, these are arguments \nto make before the Courts on the interpretation of Article 102 TFEU as this would avoid the confusion \nof introducing a separate legal regime. The same problem applies \u2013 albeit less acutely \u2013 to Options \n3 and 4 with the need for the NCT to apply the same standard to the same facts as under Article \n101  and  102  TFEU  (as  otherwise  the  Commission\u2019s  existing  competition  instruments  risk  being \nrendered practically redundant).  ","240":"More practically, there will be a clear need for a priority rule to set out in what circumstances the \nNCT should apply, and in what circumstances only the traditional application of Article 101 and 102 \nTFEU  should  be  permitted.  This  is  critical  for  ensuring  coherence.  This  requires  a  clear  and \npredictable  set  of  rules  which  dictates  which  of  the  legal  tools  \u2013  the  NCT  or  existing  rules  \u2013  is \napplicable. Effectively, this means clearly defined scenarios where existing competition rules are not \n\u201ceffective\u201d and thus the NCT may kick into action. For example, the UK\u2019s market investigation regime \nis clear that a market investigation should only be pursued where (a) there are \u2018reasonable grounds \nto  suspect\u2019  \u2018features\u2019  of  a  market-distorting  competition  but  there  are  not  sufficient  grounds  to \nestablish a breach of its conventional competition tools, or (b) conventional competition tools are \n\u2018likely to be ineffective.\u201926  ","241":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIf the NCT is adopted, the Commission should therefore issue guidance which clearly explains the \nscenarios in which conventional competition tools are likely to be considered ineffective (and thus \nwhere the NCT applies). In this regard, the effectiveness of existing rules to address certain conduct \nmust not be conflated with the ease of intervention. The UK market investigation regime provides \nsome  example  on  the  types  of  situations  which  may  be  considered.  For  example,  the  CMA\u2019s \nguidance states that single firm conduct will generally not be considered for market investigations, \nexcept where the conduct stems from market features which have negative effects themselves. In \ncontrast,  the  NCT  Impact  Assessment  seems  to  indicate  that  the  NCT  will  address  single-firm \nconduct. The Commission should therefore be clear on the circumstances in which (and why) it will \nconsider certain single firm conduct cases under the NCT, and others under existing antitrust rules, \nas this is not currently clear. For example, will the NCT only be used for single firm conduct where \nthe problem cannot be fully addressed by requiring that firm to change its conduct? Many similar \nquestions  will  fall  to  be  considered,  and  the  Commission  will  need  to  address  these  clearly  in \nguidance on the priority rule. ","242":"As outlined in Section 2, the NCT would potentially cover a range of conduct and issues that are \nmore  or  less  likely  to  give  rise  to  competition  concerns. These  issues  then  have  the  potential  to \ntranslate into different legal tests depending on the relative likelihood of issues being \u201cproblematic\u201d. \nTo  preserve  the  coherency  of  competition  policy,  relative  standards  must  be  preserved \nnotwithstanding  the  use  of  different  instruments  for  intervention  (e.g.  under  the  NCT, Article  101 \nTFEU and Article 102 TFEU).  ","243":"Taking a specific example, unilateral conduct of non-dominant firms is generally presumed to be less \nlikely to have harmful effects on competition than conduct by dominant firms. In that context, it would \nbe incongruous if the NCT were to apply a lower standard of intervention against unilateral conduct \nby non-dominant firms than applies to unilateral conduct by dominant firms under Article 102 TFEU. \nPerversely, this may result in greater regulatory intervention, due to the lower standard, in respect \nof conduct outside the scope of existing antitrust prohibitions, which is by its nature less likely to be \nharmful (and more likely to be efficient) than prohibited conduct.   ","244":"At the heart of the NCT, and what would set it apart from the Commission existing Sector Inquiry \ntool, will be its power to address the problems which it identifies. As the Consultation sets out, there \nis  a  range  of  imaginable  forms  of  intervention  from  non-binding  recommendations  or  mandated \nremedies, through to legislative or regulatory proposals. One of the principal challenges under the \nNCT will be to ensure appropriate and proportionate intervention. It is one thing to identify where \nmarkets \u201care not working well\u201d, but it is quite another to identify where intervention (and which type \nof intervention) would improve the functioning of the market. ","245":"Under the merger control rules and Article 101 TFEU, the counterfactual is relatively straightforward. \nIn the case of merger control, it is a world in which the merger will be prohibited (whether this is the \nstatus quo or an alternative scenario). In the case of Article 101 TFEU, it is the world without the \nrestriction or, if the restriction is ancillary to an agreement, the world without the agreement. In the \ncase of an abuse of dominance control under Article 102 TFEU, the situation is more complex. Again, \nthe counterfactual is a world without the abusive behaviour but what such a world looks like will in \npart be determined by the remedy. An unbundling remedy will lead to a different counterfactual than \na \u201cmust-carry\u201d remedy \u2013 as the Commission has found out to its cost in Microsoft I (WMP). Failing \nto engage with the remedy counterfactual, and the need to balance this with the status quo thus \nthe \nrisks \ncounterbalancing benefits to the competitive process. ","246":"The  counterfactual  in  a  market  investigation  is  even  more  elusive.  As  there  is  no  prohibited \nbehaviour,  the  counterfactual  cannot  be  defined  by  a  world  in  where  the  unlawful  behaviour  has \nceased.  Instead,  the  counterfactual  will  be  linked  to  an  array  of  potentially  problematic  market \nfeatures and conduct. In some cases, the counterfactual will remain straightforward: e.g. but for the \nrelevant  market  feature  (e.g.  conduct  prohibiting  multi-homing)  would  the  market  be  more \ncompetitive?  However,  in  other  cases,  the  market  features  are  likely  to  give  rise  to  uncertain \ncounterfactuals  as  the  new  \u201cnormal\u201d  is  not  clear  (e.g.  whether  a  lack  of  interoperability  is  stifling \ncompetition). The Commission may be relatively in the dark as to the likely effects of intervention \nand will struggle to balance this against the status quo. Faced with the scenario, one might consider \nwhether it is better to regulate the devil you know rather than mandate the devil you don\u2019t. ","247":"In any case, clear identification of the proposed remedy is a necessary starting point to even attempt \nto weigh up the costs and benefits of intervention. For example, if there is a perceived problem of \nlack  of  interoperability,  is  the  appropriate  counterfactual  a  scenario  where  partial  or  full \ninteroperability is permitted and are all firms or only the dominant firm (if there is one) deemed to be \nproviding interoperability? Absent clarity on the nature of the remedies, the Commission is likely to \nstruggle  to  determine  whether  intervention  is  beneficial.  The  remedy  and  the  counterfactual  are \ninseparable,  and  the  counterfactual  is  necessary  to  evaluate  the  status  quo.  As  such,  the \nCommission must be able to conceive of an alternatively functioning market before it can speak to \nthe problems of the existing market. ","248":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCompetition  Commission  found  that  it  was  unable  to  remedy  the  inefficiencies  with  the  available \nremedies because they did not provide an effective and proportionate solution.27 The Courts in the \nUK  have  also  rejected  market  investigation  remedies  where  the  competition  authorities  failed \nproperly  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  remedies,  and  how  consumers  would  respond.28  It  is  not \nsufficient  to  merely  assert  that  structural  problems  exist  and  assume  that  a  specific  remedy  will \ncorrect them (without  any  unintended consequences). The UK market  investigation regimein this \nway provides a helpful illustration of what can go wrong if the question of a suitable remedy is not \nbeing sufficiently thought through in advance.  ","249":"Remedy design is complex, especially in fast-moving dynamic markets such as the digital sphere. \nAn  obligation  to  identify  plausible  remedies  early  in  the  process  would  aid  the  Commission  in \ndetermining  whether  the  NCT  is  an  appropriate  instrument  to  address  the  alleged  structural \ncompetition problems. While the NCT may, in theory, be capable of identifying a large number of \nmarket imperfections and resulting concerns, not all of them can be effectively remedied nor are the \ncountervailing  costs  of  such  remedies  straightforward. To  illustrate  this,  as  discussed  in  detail  in \nSections 2 and 3, one of the Commission\u2019s key concerns is maintaining competitive pressure on \nmarket \u201cgatekeepers\u201d (i.e. quasi-dominant online platforms) and ensuring that markets do not unduly \n\u201ctip\u201d  towards  a  single  platform.  There  is  a  range  of  theoretical  remedies  for  such  concerns:  e.g. \nfacilitating  multi-homing  or  prohibiting  conduct  designed  to  ensure  incompatible  standards. \nRemedies  which  ensure  interoperability  between  different  systems  can  reduce  or  eliminate  the \nnetwork effects that give rise to tipping. However, these remedies carry different costs and may be \nmore or less feasible depending on the circumstances.29 Indeed, interoperability may not always be \neconomically or technically feasible.  Moreover,  even  if full  interoperability could  be achieved, the \nnature and frequency of interaction with platforms may mean users are in any case unlikely to multi-\nhome or switch platforms.  ","250":"If a plausible remedy which addresses the competition concern cannot be identified, it makes little \nsense to pursue an in-depth investigation. A requirement to identify plausible remedies at an early \nstage would therefore ensure that the costs of an in-depth investigation would only be expended if \nthere  is  a  reasonable  prospect  of  any  concern  (should  it  exist)  being  capable  of  being  remedied \n(without the cost outweighing the benefits of intervention). This does not require the Commission to \nhave  decided  on  a  remedy  before  conducting  an  in-depth  investigation,  but  to  at  least  have \nestablished the plausibility of some form of remedy for the alleged structural competition problems \nin question.  ","251":"27  CMA, Private Motor Insurance Market Investigation (Final Report 2014), para 12.17 \n28  In Payment Protection Insurance (PPI), the OFT at the time stressed the importance of obtaining empirical evidence of \nthe  likely  effects  of  remedies  on  consumers  when  designing  demand-side  remedies,  cautioning  that  the  theory  of \nbehavioural  economics  needs  to  be  supported  with  empirical  evidence.  In  the  ensuing  market  investigation,  the  CC \nconsidered that consumers may face behavioural biases at the point of sale in purchasing a primary product (e.g. a loan) \nand in choosing whether to buy an add-on product when it is offered (e.g. PPI). Part of the package of remedies proposed \nby the CC was to prohibit credit providers from selling PPI as an add-on at the point of sale of the primary product, and \nfor up to seven days afterwards. However, the CAT rejected this remedy as the CC had provided insufficient evidence of \nhow  consumers  would  respond  to  it,  whether  it  would  benefit  them,  and  how  this  would  weigh  against  the  loss  of \nconvenience to consumers. The CC subsequently undertook consumer surveys and a number of experiments to obtain \nfurther evidence, before confirming the point-of-sale prohibition. It is not enough to assert that biases exist, and that a \nspecific  remedy  will  correct  them.  In  practice,  such  evidence  might  be  obtained  from  the  empirical  literature,  the \nexperimental literature, by undertaking experimental analysis, or by undertaking other forms of \u2018road testing\u2019 of remedies.  \n29  See the \u201ctopsy-turvy principle\u201d outlined first by Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole, \u2018Two-Sided Markets: An Overview\u2019 ","252":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fsuspected problem, in terms of its adverse effect on competition, is such that a reference would be \nan appropriate response; and (ii) \u2018there is a reasonable chance that appropriate remedies will be \navailable.\u201930 Potential remedies are now considered from the start of the process, and sometimes \neven (informally) before the launch of a formal Market Investigation. This creates valuable additional \ntime  compared  to  a  scenario  where  remedies  are  only  considered  once  adverse  structural \ncompetition problems have been identified.31 For example, the CMA opted not to take refer Online \nPlatforms and Digital Advertising (2020) for a market investigation despite having identified prima \nfacie  concerns  because  the  CMA  did  not,  in  part,  have  suitable  remedial  powers  to  address  the \nrelevant issues.32 The procedure should also allow for sufficient time to design and test behavioural \nremedies (e.g. through controlled trials).  ","253":"In summary, therefore, there is merit to having a legal test that requires a clear link between the \nharm (i.e. the structural risk or lack of competition under the NCT) and the remedy.33 This would also \nguard against overenforcement or unnecessary intervention. It will also require the Commission to \nthink through the impact of remedies, bearing in mind for example that consumers may make rational \ndecisions not to engage in a market where this would provide little utility gain relative to the effort \ninvolved.  Simply  assuming  that  greater  choice  is  desired  by  consumers  will  tend  to  result  in \nineffective and\/or unnecessary remedies. ","254":"Remedies can, in broad terms, be divided in two ways: first, between behavioural remedies (which \nrequire firms to change their conduct) and structural remedies (which require firms to divest assets \nor businesses); and, second, between remedies pertaining to the private sector (i.e. obligations on \nundertakings) and remedies pertaining to the public sector (i.e. obligations on, or recommendations \nfor,  public  bodies  including  the  EU  itself).  Remedies  can  also  be  conceived  as  either  prohibitory \n(prohibiting certain types of conduct) or mandatory (requiring firms to take positive actions). In this \nregard,  structural  remedies  are  inherently  mandatory  (as  they  require  firms  to  divest  and  \/  or \nseparate part of their business) while behavioural remedies can be both prohibitory (e.g. a remedy \nrequiring  a  dominant  firm  to  cease  using  exclusivity  rebates)  or  mandatory  (e.g.  an  obligation  to \nprovide access). ","255":"The scope of the Commission\u2019s remedial powers for private undertakings should not, in principle, \ngive rise to points of contention. The existing remedial powers under Regulation 1\/2003 provide the \nCommission  with  the  ability  to  impose  any  form  of  structural  or  behavioural  remedy  on  private \nparties. In particular, the Commission is entitled to impose \u2018any behavioural or structural remedies \nwhich  are  proportionate  to  the  infringement  committed  and  necessary  to  bring  the  infringement ","256":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\feffectively to an end.\u201934 While the market structure-based tool would cover a significantly wider range \nof issues and thus inevitably a wider set of regulatory solutions, the Commission\u2019s existing powers \nalready provide significant flexibility. There is thus no need to expand or loosen the Commission\u2019s \nthese already significant remedial powers.  ","257":"The use of remedies in practice throws up, however, more far-reaching issues of how to achieve an \nappropriate  balance  between  Type  1  Errors  (under-enforcement)  and  Type  2  Errors  (over- \nenforcement). This  is  because  many  of  the  issues  that  the  Commission  is  proposing  to  address \nunder the NCT \u2013 outlined in Section 2 \u2013 are likely to require mandatory remedies. For example, the \naccess remedies entailed by interoperability would require the Commission to mandate undertakings \nto  provide  access  on  terms  to  be  determined  by  the  Commission.  Mandatory  behavioural  and \nstructural  remedies  require  inherently  more  complex  trade-offs  than  prohibitory  remedies:  in  the \ncase of the former, the \u201cfactual\u201d is more complicated as this depends on the terms of the positive \nobligation while in the case of divestment there is a significantly greater risk of chilling effects given \nthat such remedies undermine legal certainty. A robust proportionality standard, therefore, becomes \ncritical, as discussed further below.   ","258":"As far as the balance between competition and consumer policy is concerned, this can be framed \nas  a  question  of  whether  Commission  can  only  address  the  cause  of  the  potential  structural \ncompetition problem (i.e. by improving the competitive process) or can also address the symptoms \nof  structural  competition  problem  (e.g.  by  prohibiting  conduct  that  \u201cexploits\u201d  the  structural \ncompetition problem). As we outlined in Section 4.1, these types of decisions entail complex trade-\noffs and the balancing of a multitude of interests and rights. In practical terms: will the Commission \nhave the power to price regulate or not? If so, this would confer on the Commission powers to which \nit is not best suited \u2013 given its focus on competition policy \u2013 and would undermine the overriding \nprinciple  that  EU  competition  policy  is  intended  to  ensure  that  markets  are  efficient  rather  than \ndetermine  where  markets  themselves  may  not  deliver  optimal  outcomes.  It  would  require  the \nCommission  to  know  what  the  \u201cright\u201d  outcomes  for  consumers  are,  and  then  deliver  the  \u201cright\u201d \noutcome whether or not the competitive process  is capable of doing so.  This strays outside the \nrealms  of  competition  policy.  Accordingly,  where  the  Commission  is  unable  to  improve  the \ncompetitive  process,  it  should  not  have  broad  powers  to  impose,  for  example,  industry  price \nregulation.  Such  measures  are  better  left  to  sector-specific  regulators  and,  if  necessary,  the \nCommission  could  make  recommendations  as  such.  This  ensures  consistency  with  the \nCommission\u2019s  existing  powers  under  Regulation  1\/2003  (which  are  limited  to  ceasing  the \ninfringement)  as  well  as  ensuring  that  the  Commission  does  not  become  a  de  facto  sectoral \nregulator. ","259":"That is not to say that the NCT should not intervene on the demand side of the market. Indeed, even \nunder existing antitrust rules, without understanding how consumers engage with a market and how \nthey  will  respond  to  certain  changes,  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  design  effective  consumer-facing \nremedies. Building on our assessment in Section 4.1, remedies could address demand-side issues \nwhere  firms  deliberately  seek  to  leverage  customer  biases  to  entrench  their  market  position. \nExamples might include failing to provide clear and comparable information, refusing to deal with ","260":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fprice comparison website services, including contractual terms that make switching costly or making \nthe process of switching cumbersome. Firms could be required to make changes to their conduct in \nthese areas. While these interventions may be designed to account for certain consumer biases, \nthey  can  have  very  significant  implications  for  competition,  even  in  relatively  unconcentrated \nmarkets.35 ","261":"Finally, the Commission\u2019s potential powers to remedy competition \u201cproblems\u201d created in part or in \nfull by national or EU legislation or regulation give rise to complex questions of the Commission\u2019s \nrole and, even more broadly, the EU\u2019s power to intervene to correct \u2013 or propose corrections to \u2013 \nnational or EU legislation (see Section 4.2 above). There are, however, good reasons for the NCT \nto have at least some powers to bridge the public \/ private divide. At its most simple, this is so that \nthe  NCT  can  address  market  failures  stemming  from  public  regulation  and  legislation  as  well  as \nmarket failures that stem from market structure or the conduct of firms. Indeed, where markets are \neffectively  protected from competition by  poorly designed regulation it is  both more effective and \nultimately less  burdensome to remove  those constraints than  to seek to control the behaviour of \nfirms  within  that  market  reacting  in  an  economically  rational  way  (for  example  by  raising  prices).  \nWhile in some cases, regulations will have a conflicting social objective, the Commission could still \nrecommend that the regulation be redesigned, if possible to promote that purpose without harming \ncompetition. Such remedies also have analogies with the Commission\u2019s existing powers which, for \nexample,  enable \nlegislation,  regulations  or \nadministrative measures which \u2018put public undertakings and undertakings to which they grant special \nor exclusive rights in a position which the said undertakings could not themselves attain by their own \nconduct\u2019 without infringing Article 102 TFEU.36 ","262":"It is well established in the jurisprudence of the European Courts that any remedy imposed by the \nCommission under Article 7 of Regulation No. 1\/2003 is subject to the principle of proportionality (in \nthe broad sense of the word).37 This key tenet of European law requires that \u201cmeasures adopted by \nthe Commission do not exceed the limits of what is appropriate and necessary in order to attain the \nobjectives  legitimately  pursued  by  the  act  in  question\u201d.38  More  specifically,  the  principle  of \nproportionality implies a three-legged test: ","263":"37  Judgment of 17 September 2007, Microsoft v Commission, T-201\/04, EU:T:2007:289, para 1258; Judgment of 27 June \n2012, Microsoft v Commission, T-167\/08, EU:T:2012:323, para 85; Order of 10 July 2001, Irish Sugar v Commission, C-\n497\/99P, EU:C:2001:393, para 15; Judgment of 11 March 1999, Eurofer v Commission, T-136\/94, EU:T:1999:45, para \n271; Judgment of 10 April 2008, Deutsche Telekom v Commission, T-271\/03, EU:T:2008:101, para 252; Judgment of 30 \nJune 2016, Cartes Bancaires v Commission, T-491\/07, EU:T:2012:633, para 440; and Judgment of 14 May 1998, Gruber \nWeber v Commission, T-310\/94, EU:T:1998:92, para 172.

This  is  partly  because  it  can  conflict  with  the  principle  of \neffectiveness.40 Indeed, although in the abstract this may be seen as good policy (as it is \nessentially a cost-benefit analysis), it is difficult to apply in the sphere of antitrust remedies \nbecause the costs and benefits are not borne by the same person (or at least by two groups \nof comparable importance). In an antitrust context, implementing the remedy is a cost for \nthe undertaking (a private interest) while it benefits the public interest.41 ","265":"As outlined above the intended subject matter of the NCT is inherently likely to involve more complex \nremedy scenarios such as mandatory remedy access remedies. This necessitates a wider and more \ncomplex universe of remedies. In other words, with a broader set of issues inevitably also comes a \npotentially  broader  set  of  remedies.  The  breadth  of  potential  remedy  types,  and  the  ability  and \nflexibility to develop a package of remedies, is likely to be especially valuable for the Commission \nunder  the  NCT,  given  the  complex  set  of  drivers  for  the  issues  arising  in  many  digital  markets. \nHowever, while these powers are likely essential for the success of the NCT, it is imperative to ensure \nany remedies adhere to the principle of proportionality. ","266":"This  complexity  is,  as  such,  not  inherently  problematic:  remedies  could,  in  theory,  be  tailored  to \naddress any concern. However, it is not always wise to do so. More complex trade-offs in behavioural \nconcerns  translate  into  more  complicated  trade-offs  for  determining  effective  remedies.  Such \nconcerns  are  most  pertinent  where  remedies  seek  to  re-engineer  significantly  the  \u201chow\u201d  of  the \ncompetitive process. This raises the risk that remedies may be disproportionate to the competition \nconcern.  Indeed,  while  standard  competition  law  remedies  tend  to  be  narrow  and  backwards-\nlooking, remedies under the NCT can be forward-looking and market-wide, with remedies applying \nacross the market, irrespective of individual firm market power, much like under the UK regime.42 In \nsum,  the  more  intrusive  the  remedy  the  more  likely  it  will  be  to  have  unintended  and  negative \nconsequences.  More  complex  (behavioural)  remedies,  therefore,  merit  careful  consideration  and \ncaution to ensure adherence to the principle of proportionality.

","270":"To make conclusions on the functioning of the market in general, the  European  Commission will \nneed  to  be  able  to  request  information  from  a  variety  of  market  participants.  To  this  end,  the \nCommission  will  require  similar  powers  to  request  information  as  it  has  under  the  EUMR  and \nRegulation  1\/2003.  In  general,  given  the  broad  scope  of  investigations  and  to  avoid  placing \nunnecessary  burdens  on  business  where  no  wrongdoing  is  suspected,  the  Commission  should \nfavour  issuing  simple  requests  for  information.  However,  given  the  need  to  conclude  NCT \ninvestigations  in a  timely  and efficient  manner, it would be appropriate for the Commission to be \nempowered, where it has narrowed the scope of the investigation down to more clearly identified \nconcerns, to issue requests for information by decision, setting time limits and periodic penalties, in \nthe  same  way  as  under Articles  11(3)  and  15  of  EUMR  and Articles  18(3)  and  23  of  Regulation \n1\/2003. The Commission should likewise be empowered to take statements and interview natural \nand legal persons to collect information, as under the EUMR and Regulation 1\/2003. ","271":"However,  one area of difference between the NCT and the EUMR  and  Regulation 1\/2003 arises \nconcerning the Commission\u2019s more draconian \u201cpowers of inspection\u201d (i.e. dawn raids). Under the \nEUMR and Regulation 1\/2003, the Commission is entitled to conduct all necessary inspections of \nundertakings  premises  in  order  to  carry  out  its  duties  under  those  regulations.  These  powers  of \ninspection  are  limited  by  the  Courts  under  the  CFR,  the  principle  of  proportionality  and  the \nrequirement  to  state  reasons. The  EU  Courts  have  recognised  that  the  Commission\u2019s  powers  of \ninspection constitute \u201ca clear interference with the right to respect for privacy, private premises and \ncorrespondence\u201d.43 Indeed, in most national legal orders in the EU, such far-reaching interventions \nrequire prior authorisation from a court. To justify interference with this right and make it feasible to \nexercise  judicial  review  (Article  47  CFR),  the  Commission  must  provide  inter  alia  a  statement  of \nreasons for the inspection, including a description of the features of the suspected infringement.44 \nWhereas the Commission may conduct inspections in the context of Sector Inquiries and has done \nso in the Pharma Sector Inquiry, there is some doubt as to when such inspections will be considered \nnecessary and proportionate by the Courts.45 The Court outlined in National Panasonic that such \ninspections may conform with the principle of proportionality provided that the sole purpose of an \ninspection is to enable the Commission to gather information needed to assess whether the Treaty \nhas been infringed.46 However, as NCT investigations would not entail any finding of a competition \ninfringement,  nor  are  they  in  a  broader  sense  a  tool  for  the  Commission  to  investigate  potential \ninfringements  of  the  Treaty  (as  Sector  Inquiries  have  been  typically  used),  there  are  serious ","272":"44  Judgment of 8 March 2007, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com v Commission, T 339\/04, EU:T:2007:80, para. 59. \n45  See Helene Andersson, Dawn Raids Under Challenge: Due Process Aspects on the European Commission\u2019s Dawn Raid \nPractices (Hart Publishing 2018), ch 9 (Dawn Raids in Sector Inquiries) 254-265, who argues that the Pharma Sector \nInquiry  dawn  raids,  where  companies  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  size  rather  than  any  likely  involvement  in  an \ninfringement,  could  have  been  considered  as  in  breach  of  Article  7  of  the  Charter  and  the  principle  of  proportionality \n(though the decisions were not appealed). She further argues that the Commission\u2019s dawn raid powers in the context of \na Sector Inquiry should be limited to where it has grounds to suspect competition infringements. ","273":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fquestions over whether similar inspection powers in the context of the NCT would ever be necessary \nor proportionate. Indeed, absent even a suggestion of wrongdoing, it may be difficult to justify the \ninterference with fundamental rights. We do not, therefore, consider it to be necessary or appropriate \nto attach powers of inspection to NCT investigations.  ","274":"A more pertinent question is how to safeguard against improper use of investigatory powers in the \napplication of the NCT. NCT investigations will generate significant costs, both administratively and \nfor the market participants involved. For example, under the existing framework, the Commission \nmay  undertake  a  sector  inquiry  in  order  to  gather  information  generally  about  a  market  which  it \nconsiders  may  not  be  working  well.  Specifically, Art  17  of  Regulation  1\/2003  states  that  Sector \nInquiries may be opened \u201cwhere the trend of trade between Member States, the rigidity of prices or \nother  circumstances  suggest  that  competition  may  be  restricted  or  distorted  within  the  common \nmarket\u201d. This is necessary to avoid arbitrary decisions, fishing expeditions and enable judicial review \nof the legality of the decisions.  ","275":"However,  NCT  investigations  are  also  likely  to  generate  significant  additional  costs  associated \nbecause  of  the  associated  remedial  powers.  The  possibility  of  remedies  will  cause  companies \nsubject to incur significant cost and business disruption making their case as to why the remedies \nconsidered are unnecessary\/disproportionate. Given these concerns, it may be advisable to split the \nNCT investigation into two phases. The first phase could focus on establishing the existence of a \nprima  facie  structural  competition  problem  (and  whether  an  NCT  investigation  is  the  appropriate \nresponse). This will also allow the Commission, where it concludes that the identified problems are \nnot structural in nature and could be addressed under the existing framework, to conclude the NCT \ninvestigation  and  if  necessary,  launch  investigations  under Article  101  or Article  102  TFEU.  The \nsecond NCT phase would then be focused on determining which (if any) remedies are appropriate \nand  proportionate  to  the  identified  structural  competition  problem.  The  affected  parties  should, \nhowever, be able to offer voluntary commitments at the end of Phase I, to avoid lengthy Phase II \ninvestigations where simple solutions are available.  ","276":"The separation of two phases would be efficient as this structure would provide for an efficient screen \nto focus on those cases which merit detailed levels of information gathering, in-depth investigation \nand  rigour.  For  example,  the  first  phase  would  likely  have  a  much  broader  scope,  with  more \nparticipants actively involved, such that issuing detailed information requests to all businesses in the \nsector may be disproportionate. A two-stage process would not be new to the EU framework, as it \nexists under the EUMR, and it would also be similar to the UK market investigation regime where \nthe \u201cmarket study\u201d has become a de facto Phase I, which \u2013 if the requisite legal test is satisfied \u2013 \nmay result in a market investigation reference (\u2018Phase II\u2019). ","277":"A  clear  legal  test  for  the  opening  of  a  Phase  I  investigation  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  the \nCommission does not engage in \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d, launching lengthy NCT investigations without \na  clearly  defined  theory  of  harm  or  potential  remedies  considered.  Moreover,  the  likelihood  of \nmarket-wide  remedies  associated  with  a  Phase  II  investigation  will  likely  push  the  affected \nundertakings to incur significant additional costs to ensure that the remedies adopted (if any) are \nappropriate. A separate and stricter legal test for the opening of a Phase II NCT investigation, similar \nto the \u201cserious doubts\u201d test for Phase II investigations under Article 6(1)(c) EUMR would therefore \nbe  appropriate.  This  test  should  ensure  that  the  Commission  is  required  to  provide  sufficient \nexplanation of the nature of the investigation, as well as the potential remedies being considered, \nso that affected undertakings can  properly make  their defence. This will also  help to ensure that \nthere are feasible remedies in contemplation before incurring the cost of an in-depth investigation. ","278":"A time-limit on the market investigation is necessary for two reasons. First, it supports the aims of \nthe tool: a clear time limit is in keeping with the \u201cearly intervention\u201d rationale of the NCT and should \nensure that sight of this goal is not lost as the tool develops. Second, it contributes to the efficiency \nof  the  tool:  given  the  substantial  cost  and  frustration  associated  with  lengthy  investigations,  time \nlimits guard against unnecessary costs and will help to ensure that NCT investigations are focussed \nand efficient from the start. ","279":"Following the approach of the UK\u2019s market investigation regime, for example, a time limit for each \nphase of the market investigations could be adopted. For example, at the end of a legally binding \ndeadline for Phase I, the Commission could be required to decide whether to continue with an in-\ndepth NCT investigation (if the legal test is satisfied) or close the investigation (and potentially open \nantitrust cases if evidence of potential infringements has been found). Subsequently, a second-time \nlimit could be applied for Phase II of the NCT investigation by which point the substantive findings \nmust be made and any remedies determined. The definition of remedies must be included in the \ntime limit, as remedies are the critical defining element of the NCT and there must be an impetus to \nconsider and develop these from an early stage, as discussed above.  ","280":"The effectiveness of the time limit must, however, be protected. Firstly, the Commission should not \nbe allowed to use other investigatory powers which are not subject to time limits as a de facto \u201cpre-\nNCT\u201d phase. Secondly, the Commission should not be able to \u201crestart the clock\u201d by reopening a new \ninvestigation in the same market\/issue following the closure of an NCT investigation. ","281":"Under  the  UK  market  investigation  regime,  there  is  no  overlap  of  personnel  between  those  who \ndecide to refer a market investigation and those who conduct, and ultimately make decisions in, the \nmarket investigation. This ensures that the market investigation is run independently and looked at \nwith a \u201cfresh pair of eyes\u201d. This model is reflective of the institutional history of competition in the UK \nand stems from the previous split between the OFT and the Competition Commission. The benefits \nof this approach have been summarised as follows: \u201cAs well as limiting confirmation bias, this two-\nstage process is also valuable for avoiding the Market Investigation process becoming a depository \nfor unpopular political issues that no one else wants to tackle.\u201d47  ","282":"The  \u201cfresh  pair  of  eyes\u201d  approach  may,  however,  be  out  of  place  in  the  administrative  model  of \nantitrust in the EU. Questions 37 and 38 of the NCT consultation \u2013 which ask whether those affected \nby  an  investigation  should  have  the  possibility  to  comment  on  (a)  the  finding  of  a  structural \ncompetition problem and (b) the appropriateness and proportionality of envisaged remedies \u2013 hint \nat the alternative. Under the European model, the most effective form of procedural safeguard would \nbe something similar to an oral hearing. This procedure has however faced criticism (including by \nthe OECD) as the ultimate decision-makers are not required to attend, and perhaps for that reason, \nmany defendants do not exercise their right to an oral hearing.48 The NCT presents the Commission, \nin the context of a new process, with the opportunity to strengthen this procedure or develop new \nsafeguards, which could be road-tested for use in existing competition procedures.   ","283":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fopen an (in-depth) NCT investigation (i.e. on the finding of a structural competition problem) and, \nlater, before the decision to impose remedies (i.e. on the appropriateness and proportionality of the \nenvisaged remedies). Both of these decisions are likely to have significant cost implications for the \naffected  undertakings  and  should  therefore  be  subject  to  an  effective  procedural  safeguard. \nMoreover, it is logical that these hearing should be split, since the concern very different issues on \nwhich market participants are likely to have diverging views and interests.  ","284":"The investigative tools at the disposal of the EC according to the NCT require a judiciable legal test \nthat  is  sufficiently  clear  and  does  not  afford  too  much  discretion  to  the  Commission  as  to  when \nintervention is permissible (consistent with Article 101 and 102 TFEU and the merger regulation). \nAbsent  a  judiciable  legal  test,  the  EU  Courts  will  struggle  to  be  an  effective  check  on  the \nCommission\u2019s power. This would be incompatible with the right to judicial review in Article 47 CFR. ","285":"In this section we take this one step further, focussing on the standard of judicial review. In our view, \nclear and judiciable tests must be designed which allow the EU Courts to conduct the same intensity \nof judicial review as for antitrust and merger control decisions and do not afford the Commission too \ngreat  a  margin  of  discretion  over  complex  economic  matters.  Facilitating  a  full  and  substantial \nlegality review would increase the legitimacy of the NCT as an apolitical, objective instrument for \nmarket regulation. ","286":"As in other aspects, valuable lessons can be learned from the UK regime. The UK regime provides \nfor  the  possibility  of  an  appeal  before  the  CAT.  The  appeal  procedure  extends  to:  (i)  the  CMA\u2019s \ndecision as to whether or not to refer a market for investigation, (ii) the CMA\u2019s findings following a \nmarket investigation, or (iii) any remedies agreed or imposed following a market investigation. The \nCAT performs only a limited \u201cjudicial review\u201d standard and does not conduct a full \u2018merits review\u2019 of \nthe decision under appeal.49 This is in keeping with the standard of judicial review for merger control \ndecisions but lower than the full merits review standard for antitrust cases in the UK. ","287":"In our view, the breadth of a market investigation regime (both in terms of scope of and potential \nremedies) and discretion awarded to the regulator should be compatible with the standard of judicial \noversight.  Indeed,  there  is  a  trade-off  between  the  discretion  afforded  to  the  authority  at  the \nadministrative\/enforcement  level  and  the  standard  of  judicial  oversight.  The  more  discretion  is \nawarded,  the  more  stringent  judicial  oversight  should  be.  Similarly,  the  broader  the  scope  and \npossibility of remedies being imposed, the more extensive the judicial oversight should be. ","288":"In the UK, the lack of a merits review standard under the market investigation regime has set a high \nbar for applicants and in practice precludes all challenges on substance. Indeed, one of the most \nstriking  features  of  the  challenges  over  the  last  decade  is,  first,  the  CMA\u2019s  success  record  and, \nsecond,  the  lack  of  head-on  challenges  to  the  CMA\u2019s  findings  (by  parties  subject  to  a  market \ninvestigation).50 The  judicial  review  standard,  in  short,  militates  against  substantive  challenges  \u2013 \ngiven the burden of demonstrating manifest error \u2013 and incentivises challenges to the CMA\u2019s process ","289":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ffor decision-making. The consequence is that the market investigation regime in the UK is comprised \nof a triad of features which limit legal certainty: the breadth of the regime, the CMA\u2019s discretion to \ndetermine  the  markets  to  investigate  and  limited  judicial  oversight. A  comparison  with  the  UK\u2019s \nmerger control regime exposes the lack of balance. While both regimes share the judicial review \nstandard for challenges to the CMA\u2019s decisions, the UK merger control regime has, in contrast, a \nprecise scope and limited CMA discretion: first, there must be a precisely defined positive act \u2013 a \nnotifiable transaction \u2013 and, second, the CMA may only investigate where the notifiable transaction \nsatisfies the jurisdictional turnover or share of supply tests.51 ","290":"In  this  regard,  it  should  be  recalled  that  the  NCT  seems  to  be  premised  on  a  great  degree  of \nconfidence  that  one  can,  for  example,  (i)  anticipate  what  markets  can  be  expected  to  tip;  (ii) \ndetermine the reasons for that tipping and whether it is, on balance, problematic; (iii) devise some \nsort of public  intervention  that  will prevent\/correct tipping; (iv)  do this in  a  proportionate way that \ndoes not compromise welfare-enhancing elements or incentives. As such, the breadth of the NCT \nand the potential of (extensive) remedies being imposed warrant detailed and intense scrutiny by \nthe EU Courts. ","291":"The importance of intense judicial review not only stems from previous experience under the UK \nregime, but it is also supported by fundamental principles underlying EU law. This goes to the core \nof the rules purporting to establish checks and balances while attributing powers to the legislature, \nthe administration and the judiciary. Indeed, the principle of effective judicial protection is enshrined \nin Article 6(1) of the ECHR, which corresponds to Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of \nthe European Union. Notably, Article 47 of the Charter does not distinguish between civil and criminal \nheads.  ","292":"In particular, legal certainty as a general principle of EU law warrants that the right balance is struck. \nAlthough  as  a  legal  principle,  it  may  be  ubiquitous  throughout  EU  case  law,  it  is  inextricably \nintertwined with the rule of law and fundamental rights.52 Effective judicial oversight is an important \nelement of legal certainty. As Pablo Martin Rodriguez has put it: ","293":"\u201c[L]egal certainty answers to a logique politique in the sense that promotes and protects the \nfull effectiveness of enacted rules and legal decisions, but also to a logique subjective in the \nform of setting limits and individual guarantees actionable against those rules and decisions. \nThis dialectical character is consubstantial to the rule of law and should be embraced instead \nof rejected.\u201d ","294":"It should be noted that, while the General Court has unlimited jurisdiction on fines, the scope of its \nreview of the legality of EU competition decisions is more limited, as it is not entitled to substitute \nthe Commission\u2019s judgment with its own. The intensity of this legality review nevertheless requires \nthe General Court to scrutinise in meticulous detail the cogency of the Commission\u2019s findings. This \nhas been demonstrated on a number of occasions, most recently in CK Telecoms UK v Commission, \nwhere the General Court annulled the Commission\u2019s decision to prohibit the merger between Three \nand O2 in the UK, where the Commission\u2019s theories of harm were criticized as too vague to support \nits conclusions and failed to show a \u201cstrong probability\u201d of a significant impediment.53 ","295":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIndeed,  in  recent  years,  it  has  often  been  observed  that  the  EU  Courts  have  demonstrated  an \nincreasing  willingness  to  deal  with  complex  economic  matters.54  More  specifically,  the  Court  of \nJustice has made clear in both merger55 and antitrust56 cases that, notwithstanding the margin of \ndiscretion  that  the  Commission  may  enjoy  with  regard  to  economic  matters  in  areas  involving \ncomplex assessments, the EU judicature must \u201cnot only establish whether the evidence put forward \nis  factually  accurate,  reliable  and  consistent,  but  must  also  determine  whether  that  evidence \ncontains all the relevant data that must be taken into consideration in appraising a complex situation \nand whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it.\u201d57 As the Court of Justice \nhas repeatedly stressed in this regard, \u201cthe EU judicature must carry out its review of legality on the \nbasis  of  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  applicant  in  support  of  the  pleas  in  law  put  forward  and  it \ncannot use the Commission\u2019s margin of discretion as regards the assessment of that evidence as a \nbasis for dispensing with the conduct of an in-depth review of the law and of the facts.\u201d58 ","296":"The fact that the NCT does not provide for fines or infringements should not impact the intensity of \nthe  judicial  oversight  of  the  General  Court,  and  the  legal  tests  must  not  be  designed  to  frustrate \nproper review as a result of that difference. Indeed, the intensity of the General Court\u2019s review of the \nlegality of Commission decisions does not notably vary between quasi-criminal antitrust decisions \nand  merger  decisions  (which  similar  to  the  NCT,  have  no  fines  or  infringements  attached).59 \nMoreover, intense scrutiny of the NCT decisions would help rather than weaken its effectiveness as \na  tool,  as  the  scrutiny  encourages  rigour  in  the  analytical  process  and  helps  to  sharpen  the \nCommission\u2019s internal decision-making process. Finally, as the NCT would have no clear precedent \nto draw on, an active role for the Courts will be necessary to shape the boundaries of the tool, and \nin order to ensure the consistent application of EU law. ","297":"The Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment states that the legal bases for the NCT would be Article 103 \nTFEU in combination with Article 114 TFEU. In our view, however, it is doubtful whether Article 103 \nTFEU constitutes an appropriate legal basis for the adoption of the NCT. Article 103 TFEU refers to \nlegislation  \u201cgiving  effect  to  the  principles  set  out  in  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU\u201d.  However,  a \ndistinguishing feature of the NCT, particularly so in respect of the market structure-based Options 3 \nand 4, is that this tool would be detached from the discrete treaty prohibitions set out in those articles. ","298":"The Impact Assessment  itself recognises that the purpose of the NCT is to  address \u201cgaps in the \ncurrent EU competition rules\u201d to address \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d.

","301":"Moreover, it is equally important to take account of the fact that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU amount \nto statutory prohibitions: the treaty itself defines certain conduct as \u201cincompatible with the internal \nmarket\u201d. Indeed, the preparatory works show that the drafters of the treaty went to great pains in \ndelineating the scope of these prohibitions.60 The NCT, however, would entail bestowing prescriptive \npowers  to  the  Union  institutions:  the  idea  is  to  empower  the  Commission  to  define  a  required \nstandard of conduct without being bound by the treaty prohibitions. ","302":"It is submitted that these limitations: (i) addressing competition concerns created by the conduct of \nundertakings (as opposed to structural competition concerns) and that (ii) statutory prohibitions (as \nopposed to a standard of conduct prescribed by the Commission), constitute basic principles of the \nEU competition law regime in Chapter 1 of Title VII of the TFEU.

It is true that \nthis provision has been interpreted broadly and that it may, under certain circumstances, be invoked \nto confer powers to an EU sector-specific regulator to adopt binding, individual decisions addressed \nto an individual or natural or legal persons.61 However, the ECJ has clarified that Article 114 TFEU \ndoes not create \u201ca general power to regulate the internal market\u201d since this would be irreconcilable \nwith the principle that \u201cthe powers of the Community are limited to those specifically conferred on \nit.\u201d62 According to established case-law, legislation adopted based on Article 114 TFEU must, first, \ncomprise  a  measure  for  the  approximation  of  the  provisions  laid  down  by  law,  regulation  or \nadministrative action in the Member States and, second, has as its object the establishment and \nfunctioning of the internal market.63 Also, case-law clarifies that the applicability of Article 114 TFEU \n\u201cfalls to be assessed [\u2026] on the basis of objective factors such as main or predominant purpose of \nthe measure and its content\u201d. If the primary aim of the measure pertains to a different policy area \nand only incidentally falls under the internal market policy, this provision does not apply.64 ","306":"  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fHowever, the problem identified in the Impact Assessment is not divergent national rules, but the \ninadequacy of the powers conferred to the Union\u2019s institutions under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (i.e. \nthe  \u201cgap\u201d  identified  in  the  Impact Assessment).

Indeed,  \u201cestablishing  of  the  competition  rules  necessary  for  the \nfunctioning  of  the  internal  market\u201d  is  an  exclusive  Union  competence  according  to Article  3(1)(b) \nTFEU, and it would be unlawful for the Member States to act.

Other major competition law enforcing \njurisdictions  (such  as  the  EU  and  Germany)  have  heavily  relied  on  regulations  concerning  abuse  of \ndominance,  and  thus,  assessed  the  relevant  issues  of  digital  markets  even  in  the  context  of  B2B \nrelationships. In contrast, the GVH's practice is quite sporadic in this regard, and it almost entirely lacks \ndominance cases of this kind. Nevertheless, its reliance on consumer protection norms allowed the GVH to \ntackle  similar  issues,  and  to  reflect  on  them  from  a  B2C  relationships  perspective.  Given  the  fact  that \nconsumer  protection  procedures  are  significantly  shorter  because  they  do  not  require  a  robust  market \nanalysis,  they  allowed  the  GVH  to  intervene  in  the  underlying  anticompetitive  practices  in  a  timely  and \neffective manner. However, although the GVH issued multiple guidelines and other soft-law instruments \nconcerning digital markets, none of them addressed specifically the issue of market power. Consequently, \nthere is somewhat of a vacuum regarding judicial interpretations of market power definitions in Hungary \nconcerning digital markets, where there is no developed case law in this field yet, since abuse of dominance \nfocused market analyses are largely absent.  ","314":"As  regards  market  power,  the  GVH's  practice and  case  law  in  merger  control  cases  and  a  recent  vertical \nrestrictions  decision  can  also  be  considered  relevant.  These  decisions  suggest  that  the  GVH's  practice \nacknowledges that the access to data and the increasing potentials of online platforms may be considered as \nsignificant  factors  of  market  power  in  digital  markets,  and  thus,  in  future  cases,  competition  law \nenforcement should take into account these factors as well. ","315":"For traditional markets, competition law has developed measures of market power and criteria applicable \nto dominance and abuse of dominance. Up to now, assessment of market power has been based primarily \non  market  shares.  Before  deciding  on  the  suitability  of  current  antitrust  tools,  the respondent  considers \nuseful to analyse what kind of non-market-share-based measures can be applied to digital markets. ","316":"The respondent has the view that, save in respect of the very specific structural competition problems linked \nto digital gatekeepers which we consider would be more appropriately and effectively addressed through the \nintroduction of ex ante regulation through the DSA amendments, and pending the outcome of the Court \nappeals in the various digital platform cases pending adjudication, we believe that Articles 101 and 102 of \nthe  EU  Treaty, if  updated  and  per  the  Commission\u2019s  ongoing  consultations,  are  suitable  and  sufficiently \neffective to address structural competition problems across all markets, particularly when supplemented by \ngreater  use  of  existing  competition  powers and  tools  available  to  the  Commission  (e.g.,  sector  inquiries, \ninterim measures).

Although there might be a range of criteria available \nthat could apply in relation to determining the gatekeeper role of large online platform companies (but e.g. user \nnumbers  seem  too  crude),  however  platforms  should  be  identified  via  a  more  dynamic,  case-by-case \nassessment.  The  following  criteria  could  apply  with  equal  force  in  relation  to  the  proposed  new  ex  ante \nregulatory  tool  to  address  online  digital  gatekeepers  and  we  consider  that  there  is  a  need  for  targeted \nintervention when a range of criteria are cumulatively satisfied: ","322":"As regards the Hungarian market, the respondent is not aware of any particular example supported by evidence \nor  legal  practice.  In  our  view,  it  is  not  obvious  that  the NCT  is  necessary  (and  in  any  case  it  should  not  be \nintroduced before the effectiveness of any new ex ante regulation can be assessed).  ","323":"Concerns have arisen about the ability of traditional competition rules to address issues in relation to digital \nplatforms, in particular when defining digital markets and identifying dominance in relation to data funded, \nmulti-  sided  markets.  In  addition,  competition  law  enforcement  is  often  too  time-consuming,  resulting  in \nirreversible foreclosure taking place before any, remedies are implemented effectively.  Remedies also tend to \nbe specific to individual cases and difficult to apply more generally. We believe that the EU should take the lead \nin  addressing  the  regulatory  challenges  posed  by  digital  markets  and  that  competition  law  and  ex  ante \nregulation need to evolve together to address these challenges.   ","324":" \n \n\fstrategies.  These  leveraging  possibilities  open  up  the  possibility  of  a  broader  range  of  conglomerate \nrelationships being affected than would otherwise be the case in more traditional markets. Our view is that a \nmore dynamic analysis of the market definition issue is required, focusing on not just existing but on potential \ncompetition. The Commission should issue guidance that takes into account the particular dynamics of digital \nplatforms and internet ecosystems. In addition, the Commission should make greater use of its powers to grant \ninterim relief where necessary to prevent markets from \u201ctipping\u201d. ","325":"Ex ante regulation might also be needed to fill the gaps that competition rules cannot address. Already existing \nex ante regulation framework can provide a suitable reference point for the type of intervention required to \naddress market failures, through the use of an adapted \u201cthree criteria\u201d test designed for digital gatekeepers. \nThe types of platforms, the types of competitive harms identified, and the remedies used to address those harms \nneed to be varied and flexible to fit the particular issues that arise. These could vary from the prohibition of \ndiscrimination to access to key capabilities or data, to even structural separation where more extreme cases of \ncompetitive harm have been identified to occur in a systematic manner. In turn, one could foresee the adoption \nof a system of listed prohibited practices, accompanied by a flexible set of remedies.

On \nthe  proposal  for  a  competition  tool,  the  respondent  has  the  view  that  before  introducing  new  tools,  the \nCommission may assess the design and scope of the proposed ex ante regulation for digital gatekeepers, and \nthat  the  existing  solutions  also  need  to  be  updated.  For  example,  the  market  definition  notice  needs  to  be \nadapted significantly in response to the challenges of the digitised economy and increase the use of existing \npowers in relation to interim measures and sector inquiries. ","329":"Thus, the following steps seem reasonable: firstly, the flexibility and reaction potential of the current antitrust \nframework have to be tested more deeply in the enforcement, and based on the practical experience, consistent \ncore principles are to be laid down. At this point the respondent emphasises that the efficiency of collecting \nproofs and evidence in the digitalised economic environment might play a key role from the perspectives of \nenforcement and the success of the regulatory regime. Secondly, it has to be examined what is the useful scope \nof  platform-specific  regulation  and  what  developments are  taking  place  in  this  field.  Should  any  uncovered \nregulatory  issues  emerge  beyond  the  scope  of  antitrust  rules  and  the  platform  specific  framework,  the \nsuitability of a new tool can be re-assessed.

One or a few big players may result in structural competition problems and dominant effects. However, dominance must not only be assessed among platforms themselves as well as between digital platforms and companies in the traditional economy, but also abuses within platforms. By engaging with both professionals and amateurs, platforms pool resources and competition forces, creating a raise to the bottom, devaluing services and restricting the capacity of others to determine their own conditions and conduct in the market.\nB. Vertical integration may result in dominance across supply chains in upstream and downstream markets. E.g. streaming services have extended their markets to include production and distribution. Integrated companies are likely to give \u2018self-preference\u2019 to their own products and services. Such dominance also results in a concentration of employer power, creating a downward pressure on working conditions across sectors. Similarly, e.g. vertical integration of shipping companies that own container terminals, together with alliances and vessel sharing practices, play a key role in facilitating the distortion of competition. \nC+D. High costs for market entry or operation can have a negative impact on competition. While some costs may be high, another cost-dimension having a negative impact on competition, however, consists in the fact that by engaging with individual providers of labour, the platform does not have to acquire any raw materials, tools or physical premises, as this economic risk is carried by the individual providers of labour. Although they sell physical services, no physical presence of the platform itself is required in the relevant market. I.e. the marginal costs for expanding the business of the platform is close to zero. \nE+F. Patents and regulatory barriers may give certain companies in the market a privileged position. However, this market privilege must also be appreciated in the light of the general interest. E.g. the provision of public services necessitates dedicated regulation. \nG+I. Platforms can build their market dominance on user-generated content, be it consumer data and behaviour or services performed by individual providers of labour. Users experience a lack of access to information and cannot influence the conditions under which they operate. Similarly recommendations and rankings on platforms are characterised by a lack of transparency. Unfair and discriminatory ranking practices must be considered as unfair competition practices.\nJ. Economies of scale is a fundamental source of market domination for digital platforms. Marginal costs for expanding business is close to zero, as platforms providing labour intensive services through abusive practices shift a large part of the costs and risks onto individual providers of labour. Platforms sometimes claim that the economies of scale are limited to the physical capacities of individual drivers\/riders\/workers, but the \u201crecruiting\u201d (or \u201cdisconnecting\u201d) additional labour providers to expand the market requires no investments.\nK+L. Network effects contribute to economies of scale and the platform ecosystem. Increasing user numbers not only expand markets both in terms of supply and demand, but also generates increasing knowledge over persons in the network. Platforms operate in two as well as three-sided markets, e.g. engaging with consumers and drivers, or consumers, restaurants and riders.\nH+M. Lock-in effects have anticompetitive effects. Preventing workers from being active simultaneously on multiple platforms or preventing portability of ratings, is comparable to exclusivity clauses and should be banned under competition and labour law. Preventing worker mobility (online or offline) through abusive practices such as non-compete clauses, preventing workers from working for a competitor, or non-poaching agreements between companies agreeing not to recruit workers from each other result in employer monopsony effects in the labour market.\nN. Practices whereby the platform itself competes with service providers on the platform amounts to abuse of its dominant position, as the platform gains access to third-party consumer data which the platform in turn may use to promote its own business activities. \nO. Significant financial strength of platforms facilitates expansionist practices whereby platforms mobilise resources to establish themselves in new markets. This includes predatory practices such as gaining market shares by offering services at artificially low prices compared to established competitors. \nQ. Data concentration is a source of market power and abuse, as the collection, linking and use of data is inherent to operations of digital platforms. For the purpose of assessing competition and market dominance, data concentration is a significant non-monetary component. The abuse of data goes far beyond the abuse of economic power, as it has negative implications on democracy, privacy and workers.Digital technology brings new dimensions to business behaviour, market structures and abuse of dominance, and consequently also poses challenges to traditional competition law and assessments. However, rather than constituting a business model in itself, digitally enabled platforms should be considered as a tool of the company running the platform. Many of the services provided by such platforms are not information society services but take physical expressions in the traditional market, in particular when it comes to platforms providing labour intensive services (e.g. transport, see C-434\/15 Uber).","371":"Digital platforms cannot operate in a regulatory vacuum. Dedicated ex ante regulation is needed as well as effective tools to address concerns relating to competition law. However, physical services provided by platforms should also be regulated by the relevant legislation regulating comparable physical services in the traditional economy. The innovative nature and competitive advantage of the business cannot lie in the fact that the platform is not subject to regulation. This goes for tax law as well as consumer and data protection, social and labour law, including applicable collective agreements in the relevant sector.","372":"As a result of the lack of targeted regulation as well as the lack of a level playing-field between comparable online and offline services, digital platforms may build their competitiveness on lower standards rather than competing based on quality services and innovation serving the society. Platforms claiming they are highly competitive refer to arguments based on competition driven by other factors than purely digital ones, such as internally competing workers on the platform against each other in a race to the bottom.\nIn the absence of competition and regulation, platforms providing labour intensive services remain free to dictate its user conditions, including the remuneration and conditions of the large dependent workforce they dispose of. As part of their large ecosystem, platforms shift an important share of the economic risk of its operations from the company to the individual providers of labour on the platform. In this way they also outcompete companies competing on the basis of resources owned internally. ","373":"Furthermore, platform companies often dispose of more than one business activity in one isolated sector. Once again this demonstrates that platform services are not limited to information society services, but their activities take physical expressions in the traditional offline economy, including in the labour market through employer monopsony effects, whereby an employer is able to unilaterally lower wage levels and downgrade standards on working conditions without losing its workforce. While the range of products and services offered may vary in upstream and downstream markets, the abusive labour strategies deployed remain the same across the value chains and the entire corporation.\nFor the purpose of determining the actual market power, traditional definitions of relevant markets do not adequately address the concerns of digital markets. Market considerations cannot be limited to only prices and sales. Not only consumer interests, but data and labour market impact is relevant to grasp the full scale of the powers exercised by platforms and their ecosystems.","374":"It is important to assess dominance and abuse by approaching the whole ecosystem as a single corporation rather than as distinct operators in different markets. A digital market platform may not necessarily be dominant in any of the different sectors it operates (e.g. books, electronics, clothes, decoration), but through its entire ecosystem it may exercise considerable dominance and influence over consumers, workers and the public.  Consequently, assessing market power in the digital economy must take greater account of its aggregated activities in different markets and their total impact on relevant online as well as offline markets. Similarly, access to user data feeding algorithms for the purpose of personalising products, offers, advertising and pricing must also be taken into consideration, with due respect to the fundamental rights of data subjects.","375":"Overall, a large market share, high concentration or barriers to market entry may point towards market power. However, market power is not in itself necessary to establish dominance and abuse, but the decisive element lies in how the company exercises its power and what effects this has. Practices such as capacity to rapidly expand into new markets, exclusion of rivals, dependency or labour providers and lock-in effects point towards abuses of a dominant position or dominant effects.Experience show digital platforms repeatedly expand into new markets and sectors, mobilising their strong financial resources, economies of scale and network effects. Online platforms use their resources and dominance to be able to expand into other markets and sectors. However, gaining a dominant position in another market is not necessarily the aim of the expansion. The very presence in different markets reinforces the aggregate dominance of the platform ecosystem. Expanding business activities into new sectors increases its user base and network effects, including access to data, which in turn strengthens the ecosystem and overall market position of the platform. Added value is generated not only by the platform\u2019s own activities but the vast activities it influences within this ecosystem and the aggregated value this represents. I.e. platforms derive their dominant power from expanding networks and markets, without necessarily being dominant in any of the different markets when assessed when one by one.Expansionist strategies often include unilateral or predatory practices such as aggressive mergers and acquisitions of rivals and start-ups. During the establishing or expansion phase, the platform may offer its products or services at artificially low prices, with which established providers are not able to compete and as a result find themselves squeezed out from the market. In the long-run, these abusive practices tend to result not only in higher consumer prices and poorer quality, but also a downwards pressure on working conditions in relevant and adjacent markets.","376":"Online platforms or dominant corporations in the traditional economy may during their implementation phase in new locations or sectors attract workers through predatory hiring with the aim of eliminating competition for labour, in order to consequently exercise a downwards pressure on their working conditions, once it has established its employer monopsony power. Thereby, a dominant platform or corporation can also use its market powers to finance artificially low consumer prices by abusively low wages.","377":"The power and dominance that the platform exercises within its ecosystem effects labour in both its primary and secondary markets, potentially resulting in labour concentrations across its different markets. E.g. a dominant online market platform is likely do exercise a downwards pressure on working conditions also within the other markets of its ecosystem, such as the warehouse sector and delivery. \nUnilateral strategies used by platforms and dominant corporations to expand into other upstream and downstream markets and sectors through anti-competitive practices must be effectively addressed by the New Competition Tool. In order to anticipate structural competition problems before they take expressions of dominance and abuse, it must be possible to address effects of dominance and lack of competition even before an actual infringement has taken place. Similarly, in order to grasp the dominance of platforms leveraged by their ecosystem, it must be possible to extend the examination of abusive business practices to all platform units within the ecosystem, for the purpose of assessing their aggregated effect, although none of them in themselves necessarily are yet dominant in their relevant market.","378":"Similarly, the New Competition Tool must increasingly take into account the dominant effects on the labour market, which in itself may constitute an abusive practice and competition infringement. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind the ecosystem as a whole. Employer monopsony may occur in the upstream market, although the downstream market may demonstrate fair competition.\nArticles 101 and 102 are still relevant to address some of the competition concerns that online platforms and dominant corporations with powerful ecosystems across markets raise. However, these two Articles in themselves fall short of effectively addressing all the forms of structural competition problems described above. As outlined in our reply to question 9.1, a New Competition Tool is needed to effectively address the impacts of dominance even before individual infringements have occurred. To identify these particular concerns, competition law must be able to assess the market impact of the whole ecosystem as such, rather than examining its different components in different markets separately. Similarly, abuse of dominant positions in labour markets must also be considered in this overall assessment of structural competition problems.Transport and delivery, housing and hospitality, retail, content sharing, media, art and entertainment, social media networks, search engines, operating systems, technology, cloud services, infrastructure, etc.Multinational corporations and online platforms with strong assets tend to control markets rather than compete. These companies do not compete and grow based on fair consumer prices, high quality products and services or innovation, but through anti-competitive practices, abuse of dominance in their ecosystems, downwards pressure on working conditions as well as through mergers, acquisitions and mobilisation of assets for resale purposes. Similarly physical or digital infrastructure can contribute to a de facto monopolisation of certain markets, due to high structural entry-barriers.","379":"Among several dominant multinationals across different markets, an increasing number of mergers and acquisitions can be witnessed in the past decades, in particular in technology and digitally intensive sectors. This increase coincides with diminishing competitive dynamics, as small innovative companies are being bought by larger corporations before they even reach the status of potential competitor.","380":"Similarly, monopolisation effects can lead to democracy problems, not only in terms of decreased freedom of choice, but also in terms of transparency and influence. This may be the case e.g. in the media sector. Consequently, it should be possible to prevent a merger also on grounds such as threats to media diversity, even though the merger in question would not necessarily result in market dominance.  \nThrough their ecosystems, online platforms have a tendency to engage in anti-competitive monopolisation, accelerated by their economies of scale, lock-in effects as well as direct and indirect network effects. Their economic growth and market expansion are further enabled by aggressive mergers. By way of example, the five largest multinational digital corporations have performed more than 400 acquisitions in the past ten years.Anticompetitve monopolisation and abusive market practices give rise to problems for consumers, workers and fair competition in online as well as offline markets. The concentration of industries into corporative ecosystems inevitably also results in labour market concentrations and monopsony effects.","381":"As many of the services provided by digital platforms are not limited to information society services, but in fact take physical expressions, they tend to squeeze out both online and offline competitors from the relevant markets. Platforms providing labour intensive services equally exercise a downward pressure on wages and working conditions, not only within their own ecosystem, but also with regard to rivals in both the digital and the traditional economy. Abusive consumer as well as working conditions constitute unfair competition. It is a well-known fact in economic and competition theory that monopolistic markets through employer monopsony power have a negative impact on the quality of employment, which consequently also impact the quality of the products and services for consumers. \nThe New Competition Tool must ensure that online platforms and dominant corporations do not defend their market powers and ecosystems through anti-competitive practices such as lock-ins and exclusivity requirements, or engage in power abuse to squeeze out competitors through predatory pricing, downward pressure on working conditions and aggressive mergers. ","382":"Similarly, the predatory acquisition of innovative start-ups and potential competitors necessitates legislative action to make such transactions subject to merger control at an earlier stage. Impacts on employment levels and quality, transaction values and data concentration should be considered determining factors in merger control.\nAlthough existing competition rules may still be relevant to deal with many illegal behaviours linked to abuses of market power, effective intervention to address structural competition concerns necessitate a New Competition Tool, as regards monopolisation strategies by online platforms and corporations which may not yet necessarily be dominant requires dedicated action, in order to prevent consumer harms and monopsony effects in labour markets. ","383":"However, competition law alone will not be capable of effectively addressing all forms of abusive practices. The New Competition Law should not stand in the way of existing labour law to apply also to digital platforms. In particular, when it comes to platforms providing labour intensive services taking physical expressions in relevant markets of the traditional economy, anti-competitive monopolisation practice also results in employer monopsony power. ","384":"However, competition law is not capable of counter-balancing such power abuse in the labour market, and the New Competition tool is the wrong instrument\/vehicle to enquiry on workplace and working condition related issues.\nAs competition law aims to address power relations between platforms and corporations, labour law is best placed to address power relations within platforms and corporations. Consequently, employer monopsony power can only be addressed by recognising digital platforms as employers of their individual providers of labour, and to make sure that competition law does not stand in the way of collective bargaining for workers working in the platform economy. This will have a positive effect not only on working conditions in the digital economy but also on fair competition in online and offline markets. \nIn order to ensure the fundamental right to collective bargaining for all workers regardless of status, collective agreements must be considered to fall completely outside the scope of Article 101 TFEU and national competition rules. Self-employed workers and other non-standard workers, including those working in the platform economy, and represented by a trade union in bargaining collective agreements, must not be considered undertakings for the purpose of competition law when acting as economic units within an undertaking rather than as undertakings in themselves. Wage-setting is not price-fixing, trade unions are not cartels. ","385":"Collective agreements derive from social dialogue and collective bargaining and are the result of balanced negotiations between trade union organisations and employers\u2019 associations\/single employers for the purpose of improving working conditions through minimum standards. Consequently, collective agreements are by their very nature inherently different from illegal horizontal agreements between undertakings resulting from anti-competitive business practices. Collective bargaining is a fundamental right and the exclusive competence of social partners and cannot be made conditional upon competition rules.Many of the monopolisation and abusive practices described above in questions 11-12 may also take oligopolistic expressions, in particular in sectors such as transport and delivery, housing and hospitality, retail, content sharing, media, art and entertainment, social media networks, search engines, operating systems, technology, cloud services, infrastructure, etc.Oligopolistic market structures are underpinned by many of the features that also characterise monopolisation practices and the aggregate effects of ecosystems mobilised by online platforms as well as by dominant corporations. Characteristics such as vertical integration, lack of transparency for users, lock-in and network effects coupled with high concentration levels result in structural competition problems, effecting both consumers and workers.Digital markets and online platforms must not be considered in a vacuum, as if their dominance did not affect competition in relevant markets and sectors of the traditional economy. Oligopolistic market structures are underpinned by many of the features that also characterise monopolisation practices and the aggregate effects of ecosystems mobilised by online platforms as well as by dominant corporations. Characteristics such as vertical integration, lack of transparency for users, lock-in and network effects coupled with high concentration levels result in structural competition problems, effecting both consumers and workers.","386":"The oligopolistic tendencies of markets dominated by online platforms are further reinforced by the fact that platform companies not only use the platform to offer its services, but the platform simultaneously functions as a form of infrastructure for other businesses. Using the platform as a common infrastructure consequently allows formal competitors to streamline their offers. \nThe New Competition Tool must foster healthier competition in monopolistic and oligopolistic markets by ensuring competition rules apply equally to digital platforms and competitors in in relevant markets of the traditional economy, while taking into account the impacts of competition not only on consumer interests but also on labour markets. \nThis new tool should be coupled with stricter regulation of digital services and ex ante regulation of digital platforms in order to ensure equal digital opportunities and improved transparency and better access to IT services for smaller companies in the market, while ensuring full respect of the fundamental right to data privacy. Liberalisation of data might in fact even have adverse effects, risking to even strengthen oligopolistic tendencies in the markets. ","387":"\nArticle 101 TFEU in conjunction with Article 102 TFEU provide the Commission with tools to address also oligopolistic practices. However, these possibilities remain somewhat limited when it comes to tacit collusions, including for the purpose of taking into account the effects on the labour market. The case law of the Court of Justice should be consolidated and further elaborated on by the New Competition Tool in this regard.","388":"However, the New Competition Tool must provide an effective complement to Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, in order not to undermine or further fragment competition enforcement in this area. Above all, the tool should be based on assessments of market structures rather than being dominance-based, particularly due to the fact that dominance in digital markets is not necessarily exercised by one platform company alone, but may be the aggregate effects of a platform ecosystem, whereby its powerful (although not in itself dominant) presence in several upstream, downstream and adjacent markets may contribute to make oligopolistic markets and tacit collusions more likely.","389":"Tipping occur in markets where added value is generated by the aggregate input of additional users, including the additional supply, demand and data they bring to the network. The bigger the network is, the bigger the interest for additional users to join will be. Similarly, expansionist strategies may result in tipping markets if competition is eliminated by \"killing mergers\" whereby start-ups as potential competitors are eliminated from the market. Once a market has tipped, the risks of not only dominant effects but also dominant behaviour increase.","390":"An increasing number of users in a given platform ecosystem increases its power and influence as well as its value. Although \u201cwinner-takes-most\u201d dynamics are typical in digital markets, it is noteworthy that they also occur when platforms provide labour intensive services taking physical expressions in the traditional economy, in sectors such as transport, delivery and accommodation. The aggregation of users and online reviews shifts demand towards one or a limited number of dominant platforms.\nAn increasing number of users results in both direct and indirect network effects, not only expanding the markets in terms of supply and demand, but also generating an increasing knowledge over persons active in these networks. Online platforms can operate in two as well as three-sided markets, e.g. engaging with consumers and drivers, or consumers, restaurants and riders. Platforms\u2019 claims that network effects are limited in a cross-border context, due to the fact that network effects enjoyed by online platforms providing physical services would be rather local, are irrelevant. In fact, these local networks are what make up the larger ecosystem of the platform, through which the platform exercises its power across different local and sectorial markets. Digital networks possess by their very nature a cross-border dimension. ","391":"Economies of scale is a fundamental source of market domination for digital platforms. Compared to companies in the traditional economy, platforms tend to enjoy bigger returns to scale. More users will be attracted the bigger the network is. The marginal costs for expanding the business may be close to zero, as platforms providing labour intensive services through abusive practices shift a large part of the economic costs and risk onto individual providers of labour. Platforms may thus be able to lower the costs of their services to outcompete other companies in the relevant market. Platforms sometimes claim that the economies of scale are limited to the physical capacities of individual drivers\/riders\/workers. However, the cost of \u201crecruiting\u201d or \u201cdismissing\u201d an additional labour provider to expand the market is close to zero and requires no investments in terms of equipment or employment, as platforms refuse to recognise employer obligations, claiming they engage with \u201cindependent contractors\u201d although these individual providers of labour have no independence or freedom as is characteristic for genuinely self-employed entrepreneurs. ","392":"Lock-in effects have a negative impact on competition and should be considered an abusive practice. Preventing workers working in the platform economy from being active simultaneously on multiple platforms or preventing portability of ratings, is comparable to exclusivity clauses in the labour market, and should be banned under competition as well as under labour law. Preventing worker mobility in the online as well as offline economy through abusive practices such a non-compete clauses, preventing workers from working for a competitor, or non-poaching agreements between companies agreeing not to try to recruit workers from each other, are likely to result in dominance and abuse in the relevant market as well as employer monopsony effects in the labour market. \nAn increasing number of users in a given platform ecosystem increases its power and influence as well as its value. Although these \u201cwinner-takes-most\u201d dynamics are typical in digital markets, it is noteworthy that they also occur when platforms provide labour intensive services taking physical expressions in the traditional economy, in sectors such as transport, delivery and accommodation. The aggregation of users and online reviews shifts demand towards one or a limited number of dominant platforms.In addition to all the above-mentioned competition concerns, tipping markets are also likely to result in labour market monopsony, in particular when it comes to platforms providing labour intensive services.The New Competition Tool must allow competition law to take due account of network effects and the likelihood of tipping markets. Greater account has to be taken of the number of users and the data accumulated by the platform and its ecosystem, in order to assess their impact on dominance and anticipate anti-competitive effects. Once again, for early intervention it will be important not only to examine dominant behaviour but also assess dominant effects.","393":"In order to improve market contestability in tipping markets, competition law must effectively intervene against lock-in effects and other abusive conditions imposed by platforms on their users. In addition to this, for the purpose of merger control, particular attention should be paid to efficiency gains in terms of network effects. Consequently, it should be possible to prohibit a merger, in case the market risks tipping as a result of the considerable influence a certain actor may possess in a market. Similarly, merger control should take due account of the risk of labour market monopsonies arising as a result of a possible tipping in the market. \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU currently fall short of adequately addressing the challenges linked to tipping markets, with regard to the concerns raised in question 17.2.","394":"In this regard, it must also be pointed out that economies of scale in themselves do not constitute market abuse. However, to the extent that the higher returns to scale of platforms compared to competitors in the traditional economy can be explained by the fact that the platforms shifts a considerable part of the economic costs and risks over to individual providers of labour, this amounts to anticompetitive practices.","395":"Nevertheless, the New Competition Tools is not the correct instrument to address such unfair competition practices, but rather it is important to ensure a level playing-field across policy areas (e.g. competition law, tax law, data privacy, consumer protection, social protection and labour law) between online and offline service providers operating in similar markets or sectors. In particular when it comes to platforms providing labour intensive services, it should be possible to recognise platforms as employers in order for existing labour law to apply to protect workers working in the platform economy and make sure they enjoy decent working conditions, including through access to collective bargaining. Competition law must not stand in the way of labour law and collective agreements applying also to platforms and workers working in the platform economy.Large online platforms control increasingly important platform ecosystems in the digital economy. Their power comes from their ability to connect many businesses, workers and consumers, to bundle a large number of services, to accumulate large quantities of data, to easily access different technical assets, to easily expand into new markets, to take over competitors or to benefit from their financial power. Relevant markets (including upstream and downstream markets) may include e.g. transport and delivery, housing and hospitality, retail, content sharing, media, art and entertainment, social media networks, search engines, operating systems, technology, cloud services, infrastructure, etc.Gatekeeper scenarios may to some extent be relevant also in the traditional economy, as a result of e.g. patents, infrastructure or attributed privileges. Similarly, a high degree of vertical integration may result in dominance in extensive markets and supply chains, in both upstream and downstream markets.","396":"However, regulation ensuring the provision and access to affordable and high-quality public services must not be considered as a gatekeeper status, as it is legitimately justified in the general interest.\nAll three above-mentioned features are characteristic for gatekeeper companies. Large online platforms tend to control entire ecosystems, which reinforces their position as economic gatekeepers, necessitating regulation across the board. Standards should be set by regulators and not by platforms. These gatekeepers have sometimes been described as big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy. As a result, they may also be considered to act as gatekeepers for fundamental rights, including workers\u2019 rights through their exercise of monopsony power in the labour market.","397":"Different online platforms offer different kinds of services, whereby some of the services remain pure information society services, whereas other services take physical expressions in a given sector of the traditional economy. The main features of a gatekeeper may therefore vary depending on whether the services offered by the platform take the expression of a search engine, a market place or the provision of labour intensive services taking physical expressions in sectors of the traditional economy.","398":"The size of the platform, be it in terms of geographic coverage, market share or turn-over may be relevant, but is not necessarily decisive for whether it can act as a gatekeeper. The same obligations should apply equally to all platforms regardless of their size, as the needs for consumer, workers\u2019 and data protection remain the same regardless of the size of the platform. It is rather the behaviour of the platform which creates negative impacts on the market and on fair competition. Digitalisation and data easily allow for economies of scale. E.g. also an SME in terms of size may have a large user base and possess big quantities of data, which may potentially be used in an anti-competitive way. ","399":"When it comes to platforms providing labour intensive services, it is important that relevant existing rules apply equally across the board for both online and offline services, in order to not distort fair competition in a given sector, be it local, national or European, including sectorial legislation and labour law together with applicable collective agreements.\nWhen it comes to competition concerns stemming from platforms acting as gatekeepers in a given market, it is important to consider abusive conditions not only in relation to businesses and consumers, but also in relation to workers working in the platform economy. As regards lock-in effects, the use of algorithms and customer ratings tends to tie workers to specific platforms, which seems contrary to the spirit of freedom and entrepreneurialism embedded in the platform economy. Similarly, platforms may penalise workers who are simultaneously active on multiple platforms in search for the gig which offers the best terms. Ratings should therefore be portable, allowing workers to move between platforms and deploy their skills as and when necessary, receiving adequate compensation and recognition for past work.In order to reduce platform control in the market, the New Competition Tool together with targeted regulation of platforms must address anti-competitive market behaviours, such as exclusive platform ownership of data and lack of transparency and access to data. To prevent lock-in effects, ratings should be portable, allowing users, including workers working in the platform economy, to move between platforms.","400":"Through a structural approach, the New Competition Tool must enable competition authorities to take into account anti-competitive practices such as market power stemming from massive data collection, concentrations of information across one or several markets, far-reaching network effects and information asymmetries, resulting in dominance effects despite any explicit dominant conduct. However, data access should only be granted for competitors to the extent that this is strictly necessary to ensure fair competition, and in full respect of fundamental rights of data subjects. For this purpose, it is important to make distinctions between different forms of data access, different types of data and different user purposes.","401":"The New Competition Tool must not consider anti-competitive practices of digital platforms in a vacuum but in relation to other platforms as well as in relation to relevant sectors of the traditional economy. If digitally enabled end-services take physical expressions (e.g. transport services), possible abuses of dominance of the enabling platform must be considered also in relation to physical competitors delivering comparable concrete services. As a result of the lack of targeted regulation as well as the lack of a level playing-field between comparable online and offline services, platforms may build their competitiveness on lower standards rather than competing based on quality services and innovation. The innovative nature of a business model cannot lie in the fact that platform can operate in a regulatory vacuum without obligations.","402":"In addition, the New Competition Tool must take due account of the labour market effects of platforms when examining dominance and abuse. Digital platforms do not merely connect supply and demand between clients and service providers or act as enablers of entrepreneurs. Rather, experience shows that the control and market power exercised by these platforms often result in labour exploitation, labour market power abuse and unfair competition in both the online and offline economy. Therefore, it must be possible to attribute platforms with employer obligations, in order to enable worker agency and ensure fair competition in the relevant service markets (online\/offline) as well as in the labour market. Competition law must not stand in the way of applying labour law and collective agreements to platforms. Nevertheless, regulation to protect workers working in the platform economy should rest under and be elaborated by the relevant competent Cabinet\/DG on Jobs and Social Rights.\nFor the reasons described above in our reply to question 19.1, Articles 101 and 102 TFEU should be complemented by a New Competition Tool, effectively taking into account not only dominant behaviours but also dominant and anticompetitive effects in the markets, including in the labour market.","403":"As previously outlined in question 11.3, competition law should be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights for the purpose of fully excluding collective bargaining for all workers from the scope of Article 101 TFEU and national competition rules.As outlined throughout this questionnaire, structural competition problems can occur across all types of sectors\/markets, be they online or offline, including taking expressions such as monopsony power in the labour market.","404":"As outlined in our replies to questions 9.3, 11.3, 17.3 and 19.3, Article 101 TFEU falls short of fully and adequately addressing the competition concerns identified by this public consultation as well as in our replies. In addition to these above-mentioned reasons, the following short-comings of Article 101 TFEU should be highlighted: ","405":"The focus on consumer interests must not be understood narrowly, but be considered to also encompass platform users in the broadest sense, including workers working in the platform economy. Ultimately, workers are also consumers. In cases where a platform behaviour or condition which exerts pressure on competition cannot be justified as beneficial for consumers or workers, it should be considered as harmful to competition. ","406":"Relevant markets are not as easily defined in the digital economy. Platforms may operate in several markets and sectors, the boundaries may change quickly, and the line between the online and offline markets may be blurred. In this regard, a holistic assessment with due regard to synergies and interdependencies within a larger ecosystem is crucial for the purpose of establishing the existence of dominance and anticompetitive effects. Rather than an excessive focus on identifying the relevant markets, competition law should allow for the identification of potential harms to competition through a structural approach. ","407":"Access to data raises particular competition problems in terms of pooling and exchange of information, but equally in terms of data privacy. Data access should not be granted for competitors unless it is indispensable for ensuring fair competition in the relevant market, and only then under strict conditions ensuring the respect for fundamental rights. Similarly, algorithms may constitute a vehicle for aligning or exchanging information on costs and prices, likely to result in tacit collusion.","408":"Finally, the current EU competition legal framework does not adequately take into account competition concerns taking expressions in the labour market, such as employer monopsony power. As previously outlined in question 11.3, Article 101 TFEU and national competition rules must be interpreted as fully excluding collective agreements from their remit, in order for collective bargaining to be able to counter-balance such structural problems in the labour market.Relevant markets (including upstream and downstream markets) may include e.g. transport and delivery, housing and hospitality, retail, content sharing, media, art and entertainment, social media networks, search engines, operating systems, technology, cloud services, infrastructure, etc.Although Article 102 TFEU is fit to address certain types of structural competition problems, it falls short of fully and adequately addressing the competition concerns identified by this public consultation as well as outlined in our replies to questions 9.3, 11.3, 17.3 and 19.3.","409":"The scope of Article 102 and the notion of abuse must be interpreted more broadly, in order to not only address dominant companies in a position to exclude competitors from the relevant markets, but also in a capacity to exploit their dominant position. Furthermore, the decisive element for this assessment should not be dominance-based behaviours, but dominance-based and\/or anticompetitive effects per se occurring in the market.","410":"Similarly, the current EU competition legal framework does not sufficiently take into account effects of dominance in the labour market, such as employer monopsony power, when assessing anti-competitive conducts and effects.Relevant markets (including upstream and downstream markets) may include e.g. transport and delivery, housing and hospitality, retail, content sharing, media, art and entertainment, social media networks, search engines, operating systems, technology, cloud services, infrastructure, etc.The New Competition Tool should be complementary to the existing EU competition legal framework, to effectively fill its gaps and address new forms of dominance, abuse and anticompetitive effects. Consequently, it should not undermine the current scope of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, but broaden the competences of competition authorities to address structural competition concerns. Rather than focussing on dominant conduct and abuse, the tool should focus on anti-competitive effects in the market.","411":"In terms of relevant markets, the control of abusive practices should duly consider the features of platform ecosystems, whereby market dominance should not be assessed separately for each market and each business unit, but be subject to overall assessment, promoting a more holistic and inclusive approach to competition law with greater scope.\nThe New Competition Tool should take a broader focus than only protecting and promoting consumer welfare as the ultimate beneficiary of competitiveness. Competition law should also serve as a distributor of social welfare, a promoter of sustainable development and a protector of inclusive markets and vulnerable actors. The fundamental values of the EU set out in Article 3 TEU are binding on all policy areas, and consequently also define the aims of the market and competition policy: \u201cThe Union shall establish an internal market. It shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy, aiming at full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment. It shall promote scientific and technological advance.\u201d","412":"An excessive focus on efficiency goals risks undermining the overarching policy goals set out by the Treaties. In this regard, it is also important to protect the public interest, including the special role of public services. It important to respect those policy objectives which are not governed by competition rules. ","413":"Beyond serving the interests of consumers and the public, competition law must also take into account the interests of workers. Particular attention must be paid to labour market impacts of structural competition problems such as employer monopsony power. Savings made by a company are not necessarily passed on to consumers and may as well stem from a downward pressure on wages and working conditions in the market, rather than from efficiencies. In fact, labour market monopsonies above all result in a redistribution from workers to employers. As a result, monopsonies are harmful to economic growth, as they contribute to wage stagnation and have a negative impact on employment rates. This in turn may lead to lower rates of productivity, innovation and poorer quality of products and services, which ultimately harms consumers. Being also consumers, workers pay a double price, both in terms of lower wages and decreased purchasing power.Ex ante regulation and early intervention is necessary, in particular to address competition concerns arising in digital markets. The New Competition Tool must allow for sufficient flexibility in order to accommodate also future digital developments and new market specificities. Early intervention is also crucial considering the rather time-consuming investigations by competition authorities. Competitive damage such as the effects of a tipping market may be difficult to reverse once the consequences have occurred. ","414":"Competition infringements must not only be punishable ex post, once they have occurred, but the New Competition Tool must contribute to conditions for fair competition being created prior to any infringements. In this regard, the tool should allow for interventions not only against abusive conduct, but also against anticompetitive effects in the market, although no single dominant actor has been identified. It should be possible to impose remedies also to address perceived market failures without having to prove that an infringement of competition rules has occurred.","415":"\nA dominant market position should not be considered a precondition in order to trigger the application of competition law. Rather than focussing on dominant conduct and abuse, the New Competition Tool should adopt a structural approach, focussing on anti-competitive effects in the market. The starting point should be prohibiting unfair competition practices. Any dominance-based requirement risks resulting in the same shortcomings as under the existing legal framework. ","416":"In terms of relevant markets, the control of abusive practices should duly consider the features of platform ecosystems, whereby market dominance should not be assessed separately for each market and each business unit, but be subject to an overall assessment, promoting a more holistic approach to competition law with a greater scope. A digital market platform may not necessarily be dominant in any of the different sectors it operates (e.g. books, electronics, clothes, decoration), but through its entire ecosystem it may exercise considerable dominance and influence over consumers, workers and the public. Consequently, assessing market power in the digital economy must take greater account of its aggregated activities in different markets and their total impact on relevant online as well as offline markets. In assessing market power and abusive effects, due regard should also be given to any occurrence of labour market monopsony power.","417":"\nTo ensure sufficient flexibility and future-proof regulation, the scope of the New Competition Tool should be as broad as possible for the purpose of guaranteeing a level playing-field. Limiting the tool to certain sectors would only result in fragmentation, loopholes, legal uncertainty and encourage artificial arrangements. A broader approach will allow for smooth and early intervention with regard to e.g. tipping markets.","418":"Sectoral legislation tend to easily become outdated. For the future it is also not possible to predict what sectors will give rise to competition concerns.  However, designing a horizontal instrument does not mean that it has to be applied consequently across all sectors, in case the sectors in question do not present any structural competition problems. \nExperience already show that digital sectors are not the only ones where structural competition problems may occur. Also, the distinction between digital and non-digital market is blurry, as more and more platforms provide services taking physical expressions in the traditional economy. Furthermore, competition law must ensure a level playing-field between online and offline markets.The New Competition Tool must allow for binding measures to be imposed on companies, in order to remedy structural competition problems in the relevant market. Soft-law approaches will not be effective. Standards should be set by regulators and not by platforms and powerful corporations.In order for the New Competition Tool to be effective and ensure fair competition and market contestability among digital platforms as well as between platforms and competitors in relevant markets and sectors in the traditional economy, both types of remedies are necessary, including their combination as appropriate. In the same way as an individual competition decision in terms of structural remedies sets a precedent for the whole market, the Commission should be able to impose market-wide behavioural remedies.","419":"The New Competition Tool should primarily be able to intervene to address prohibited anti-competitive behaviours and anti-competitive effects, even before a dominant position or abuse of dominance has occurred. In this regard, behavioural remedies may be sufficient. However, in case it will not be or has not been possible to address the structural problem in a timely or adequate manner, structural remedies may be the only option.The New Competition Tool must include stronger investigation and enforcement procedures, including a shifting of the burden of evidence to dominant companies as regards anticompetitive effects in the markets. This should go for the evidence required to open investigations and well as for imposing remedies. The identification of structural competition problems should shift the burden of proof to the companies concerned, obliging them to demonstrate that their conduct is not anti-competitive or has no anti-competitive effects in the relevant markets.","420":"In addition to this, improved monitoring of the enforcement and compliance with remedies is necessary, including their effects on employment rates, employment quality and power-balance in the labour market. \nThe New Competition Tool should broaden and strengthen the investigative powers in antitrust. The tool is also an opportunity to align the powers of National Competition Authorities with the powers of the Commission, in order to ensure effective decentralised enforcement of competition law in the EU. As previously described in this submission, digital markets may take physical expressions at local level, including in the form of features such as network effects. Digital and non-digital markets are increasingly intertwined.","421":"When it comes to the involvement of workers, this is crucial for the purpose of understanding the labour market effects of dominant platforms. In this regard, trade unions also play a crucial role, and provide a counter-weight to abusive employer monopsony effects.Binding deadlines are crucial in ensuring effective investigations, particularly in rapidly developing digital markets.Given the fact that competition investigations tend to be quite time-consuming, whereas technological developments happen quickly, the New Competition Tool should allow for the possibility to impose antitrust interim measures to ensure timely intervention and prevention.The Commission must become more consistent and assertive in its current approach to remedies. Negotiated remedies have a tendency of not being sufficiently prescriptive or precise, and without effective monitoring. Remedies must be designed to not only prevent anticompetitive conduct of the platform itself, but also restore the competitiveness of competitors.For the purpose of understanding the whole ecosystem of the platform and its market independencies, it will be valuable to give stakeholders the opportunity to give their views on the findings. In particular when it comes to understanding labour market impacts such as monopsony powers, it is crucial to hear workers as well as trade unions.In order to ensure that the envisaged remedies will not only prevent anti-competitive conducts and effects of the platform itself, but also restore the competitiveness of competitors, it is crucial to also hear the views of relevant stakeholder. In particular when it comes to understanding labour market dominance such as monopsony power, hearing workers and trade unions is key.The New Competition Tool should allow for binding measures and remedies to be imposed, which also necessitates procedural safeguards in line with good administration and access to justice.Dedicated ex ante regulation for online platforms combined with a New Competition Tool represents the best policy option. Regulation must be binding and apply to all online platforms regardless of size, in order to ensure a level playing-field in the market, for the purpose of competition law as well as with regard to other policy areas. However, dedicated competition and platform regulation must no create parallel standards, resulting in unfair competition between digital and non-digital markets.\nThe need for consumer protection, workers\u2019 rights and data protection remains the same regardless of the size of the platform or the company, as well as regardless of whether the company operates through a digital platform or directly in the traditional economy.  \n","422":"The BBC is a public service broadcaster based in the UK, which provides audio, audiovisual and text content and services across the UK, Europe and the world, including through the BBC World Service and our commercial subsidiaries BBC Global News and BBC Studios. Our services in Europe include apps such as BBC News, the website BBC.com and channels such as BBC Earth and CBBC (children's BBC). We also provide content across Europe through third party platforms including programmes sold to local distributors, and BBC short-form or promotional content on online platforms in order to engage and build a relationship with all audiences (e.g. BBC Radio 1 YouTube channel).","423":"We provide our content and services through apps, including the BBC News app.As a public service broadcaster, universality underpins our public service mission and we must rely on third parties to reach our audiences, including app stores, search, social media, voice assistants, and operating systems for connected TV, in-car and smartphones.The BBC currently sees structural competition issues with the major online platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. These companies act as strategic bottlenecks or gateways. They operate in a wide range of jurisdictions and across boarders in a way that traditional services do not. Their business models rely heavily on the exploitation of data gained across their networks by exploiting economies of scope and scale. All of the platforms therefore benefit from strong direct and indirect network effects and have the incentives to strengthen the features that build on these. As a result, from the perspective of consumers and audiences, GAFA are \u201cmust have\u201d platforms with consumers locked-in to one or more of their services. In turn, due to the large user base, businesses are obliged to use these platforms if their businesses are to be successful in reaching the substantial number or unique segment of consumers who use each platform. They are in effect unavoidable trading partners for many businesses, including the BBC. What is more, due to their control of the platform they set the rules of competition and routinely favour their own vertically integrated services ahead of those provided by third parties.","424":"Structural competition problems are manifested in a wide range of digital markets\/sectors, including: \n-Online search; \n-Consumer communications apps; \n-Social networks; \n-E-commerce marketplaces; \n-Operating systems for smartphones, smart TVs, connected cars; \n-App stores; \n-Provision of audiovisual content Over-The-Top (OTT);\n-Provision of content through voice assistants;\n-Online advertising (online auctions and ad intermediation platforms).\nIndependently these features are not necessarily problematic. However, a combination of these features can create structural issues. As noted in our response to question 6, we see Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google as gatekeeper platforms. They each control an increasing number of routes to market for the BBC and are in prime position to control markets enabled by an IP-led future. Their role as intermediary between the BBC and our audiences limits our ability to compete as key audience demographics now reside on their platforms. Their core markets tend to be highly concentrated, such as search, e-commerce, social network and mobile devices. A number of the other markets in which they operate are also concentrated. In some of these markets the Competition and Markets Authority and the Furman review in the UK have evidenced the role of tipping points. \nAs regards leveraging position from one market to another, we consider that strategic market status (tied to the concept of a gatekeeper role) or dominance or some form of ability to act independently of competitors, customers and consumers is necessary for leveraging to be a successful. In the UK, the CMA has suggested a new Strategic Market Status, which may be informed by Significant Market Power as in seen in the EU Telecoms regime as a status that recognizes the ability of firms to act independently of competitors and customers.\nFinally, though not in the list of the features the Commission identifies, a parameter that has arguably exacerbated structural competition problems is merger control. As the UK Furman report notes \u2018over the last ten years the five largest firms have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None has been blocked and very few have had conditions attached to approval [\u2026] or even been scrutinized by competition authorities\u2019.  We find that merger control should be exercised in a way that takes into account the \u2018portfolio effects\u2019 of the merger, including access to vast amounts of data, with a view to addressing certain issues (e.g. high degree of vertical integration) giving rise to structural competition problems.","425":"Several concerns arise in the case of leveraging strategies. Where platforms that hold market power in one market attempt to extend to other markets, they have the incentive to: \n\u2022Grant preferential treatment to their own services (self-preferencing). This can take various forms (e.g. prominent display, demotion of competing content, access to data). The effects of self-preferencing on competition are illustrated by the Commission\u2019s Google Shopping decision. \n\u2022Refuse to share information about how they work in practice. Lack of transparency prevents business users from gaining an adequate understanding of the parameters that determine content consumption. For voice assistants, it is not clear which parameters determine the (one and only) result of the user\u2019s query. Although the platform-to-business Regulation introduced certain transparency obligations, such obligations are not sufficient to address issues arising from the significant information asymmetries between platforms and their business users, e.g. platforms are not required to disclose whether they engage in \u2018retaliatory\u2019 practices (where, in order to expand into another market through the creation of a new platform, they retaliate against business users that wish to offer their content only on the existing platform). \n\u2022Refuse to share data with business users that compete in downstream markets in order to grant to their own subsidiaries a strong competitive advantage. This is recognised in the Commission\u2019s Communication 'A European Strategy for Data' where it is noted that \u2018a small number of players may accumulate large amounts of data, gathering important insights and competitive advantages from the richness and variety of the data they hold. The high degree of market power resulting from the \u201cdata advantage\u201d can [\u2026] allow leveraging of such \u201cpower advantage\u201d when developing new services and expanding towards new markets\u2019.  \n\u2022Engage in other data-related practices that limit access to data. These include: \n-Limiting the possibilities for data processing by business users on their own applications, where such processing is carried out in compliance with applicable data protection regulation. A platform may impede in-app tracking (even when it is compatible with the GDPR and the e-privacy rules) to prevent the transmission of data to the app owner. This practice impedes our ability to engage in audience measurement.\n-Practices related to the consent granted by online users. E.g. platforms may impose a mechanism of \u2018double\u2019 consent to trackers, which reduces the quality of the user\u2019s experience. This practice, which may lead to users refusing permission, is not required by law in the EU. \n-Removing logos and\/or other distinctive features of their business users, including content providers (lack of brand attribution). As a result, the online user is not able to assess who offers the content consumed and the content provider cannot establish a relationship with its audiences.We explain above why we find that repeated strategies by companies with market power to extend their market position into related markets raise competition concerns. This is why we believe that the Commission should intervene in such cases. One measure we would support is the establishment of reporting obligations on platforms to inform the Commission about their intention to expand their activities into other markets. The Commission could then examine the potential effects on competition and decide whether further action (e.g. the imposition of remedies) is needed.Although Article 102 TFEU is sufficiently flexible to capture leveraging strategies, it only applies ex post facto. Since digital markets move at a very fast pace and have a tendency to concentration, ex post intervention may not manage to restore the competitive process. Moreover, Article 102 TFEU only applies to single firm behaviour. In view of the above, we find that intervention under the New Competition Tool will enable the Commission to prevent a handful of providers from controlling the entire value chain. This would be to the benefit of competition and consumers alike as it would result in a wider variety of services\/content to choose from, higher quality products and more innovation.","426":"We consider that the anti-competitive behaviour of a dominant firm is best pursued under Article 102. Notional abuse that may have taken place when the company was not yet dominant, by definition could not be abusive and therefore is not subject to Article 102. It appears to be unfair if the Commission could then retrospectively assess the conduct of a firm on the way up as and when it gained a dominant position at some stage in the future, when at the time that the supposed abuse took place it would not have been classified as abusive. Such a change in law could have significant unintended consequences on firm behaviour such as unduly limiting appetite for risk or innovation by undermining legal certainty.We do not consider it applicable because monopolization is not illegal under Art 101 or Art 102. Art 101 doesn\u2019t deal with unilateral action and Art 102 only deals with the abuses of a dominant or monopoly position. Merger control is likely to be the best route through which to tackle considerations of anti-competitive monopolisation in that it restricts the ability of firms to form monopolies through acquisition.","427":"We believe we are seeing tipping points with Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. These platforms are now ubiquitous and as noted in the response to other questions increasingly act as an intermediary between the BBC and our audiences. These platforms presently have such a wide reach that they are unavoidable trading partners if the BBC is to serve all audiences and demographics.The BBC considers that all of the above features are important when occurring together. It is not clear that one individually presents an issue. The network effects are a key driver for tipping. The effect of single homing is complex. Where consumers use only one platform this can limit competition on the other side of the platform as firms have to be present if they are to access the audience. It is not just single-homing that can be an issue \u2013 the type of multi-homing observed is also important. For multi-homing to be a true indication of competition, it needs to indicate that the platforms are substitutes and therefore customers are multi-homing to switch between them rather than using them as complements, which is often the case, particularly in differentiated markets. We observe in practice that users are multi-homing across digital platforms but for reasons of complementarity rather than substitution.We consider it to be common in markets where there are both direct and indirect network effects. Network effects are a hallmark of many digital markets.We consider each of the points highlighted are potential concerns for tipping point markets.Having powers of early intervention in markets that are subject to tipping could be hugely beneficial to support the maintenance of competition both between and within platforms.\nTipping points are a structural issue due to the presence of network effects (direct and indirect). They are not, necessarily, the result of unilateral or collective action by a firm and are therefore not suited to being addressed under Art 101 or Art 102.Yes, as set out in 18.3 we have significant concerns around intermediation by digital platforms.","428":"The major online platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google act as strategic bottlenecks or gatekeepers. They operate in a wide range of jurisdictions and across borders in a way that traditional services do not. From the perspective of consumers and audiences, they are \u201cmust have\u201d platforms through a combination of lock-in and network effects. In turn, due to the large user base, businesses are obliged to use these platforms if they are to be successful in reaching the substantial number or unique segment of consumers who use each platform. They are in effect unavoidable trading partners for many businesses, including the BBC.","429":"Due to several traits characterising gatekeepers (e.g. network effects, high production\/low distribution costs, the ability to reap large economies of scale and scope), certain platforms are vertically and\/or diagonally integrated. As a result, those platforms have the ability and incentive to control entire digital ecosystems\/the entire value chain. We believe that this is a characteristic that should be taken into account in determining whether a platform is a gatekeeper. ","430":"In addition to the criteria identified by the Commission and vertical\/diagonal integration, an assessment of whether a large online platform is a gatekeeper must not be restricted to supply-side considerations. Such an assessment should further consider how users behave. This is clearly illustrated by the Commission\u2019s Google Shopping decision. In its decision, the Commission found that, though it is easy for users to switch from one search engine to another, only a minority of users multi-home (para 307-311). Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, the Commission relied on experiments showing that a significant number of online users trusted Google to such an extent that they would be highly unlikely to use a different search engine even if Google were to deliver less relevant search results (para 312 and fn 333). Taking account of user attitude enabled the Commission to gain a more complete understanding of Google\u2019s gatekeeper position in the affected market.These are all concerns with gatekeepers. Their position enables them to dictate the terms of competition to business users, which are in effect obliged to use their services to access markets. Gatekeepers aren\u2019t just present at the platform level but increasingly have vertical product offers that compete directly with the third party applications on their own system. Through the use of defaulting, preloading services and store rankings, gatekeepers can support their own vertical offers.\nAs a public service broadcaster, the BBC needs to serve all segments of society. Given that a vast amount of content is now consumed on platforms, the BBC relies on platforms to reach its audiences. Being present on different platforms is linked to the different purposes which those platforms serve. For example, the Google Playstore and Apple Appstore are used to distribute applications like the BBC News app; Facebook and Instagram are used for engaging new audiences as well as for marketing purposes and community building more widely; Google Search, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa are used by audiences to find and gain access to content. \nIn dealing with platforms, many problems arise from practices that prevent the BBC from reaching our audiences. For example, lack of transparency about how a social media network works in practice does not allow the BBC to assess how the relevant algorithm impacts the newsfeed. The same applies to how apps are promoted on popular app stores. Other issues concern the preferential treatment that platforms grant to their own services (or the services provided by advertising partners), lack of access to (reliable) data, and lack of attribution.\nWe find that it is necessary for the Commission to be able to intervene in gatekeeper scenarios to prevent structural competition problems. For example, competition concerns may arise as a result of markets displaying systemic failures due to certain structural features, such as high concentration and entry barriers, customer lock-in, and lack of access to data. In such cases, the Commission may need to intervene to allow the markets to develop in a competitive manner.","431":"However, while we believe that there is a need for the Commission to be able to intervene in gatekeeper scenarios to prevent\/address structural competition problems, we also find that there are issues concerning gatekeeper platforms that would be best addressed by regulation (please see our reply to Question 19.3. below).One of the reasons why platforms must be regulated is that, as a result of the large user base they control, they have the ability and incentive to engage in harmful practices, exploiting firms that have come to depend on them. This is the problem the platform-to-business Regulation sought to begin to address. The Regulation lays down that: \u2018Given that increasing dependence, [platforms] often have superior bargaining power, which enables them to, in effect behave unilaterally in a way that can be unfair and harmful to the legitimate interests of their businesses users and, indirectly, also of consumers in the Union\u2019. However, the platform-to-business Regulation focuses on promoting transparency. \nCompetition law is insufficient to address concerns arising from an increasing dependence on platforms. In order to understand whether a conduct or transaction is harmful to competition, competition authorities must assess its effects on competition\/the market as a whole. In other words, competition authorities do not assess its effects on individual competitors or customers. And yet, to ensure a well-functioning marketplace, those competitors or customers may merit protection even if there are no actual or potential effects on the competitive process. In view of the above, competition rules must be complemented with effective regulatory rules that promote fairness, to the benefit of competition, innovation and consumers\/citizens alike. \nIn view of the above, we find that competition law is not adequate to protect platforms\u2019 business users against abuses of economic dependence. Given the fast-moving character of platform markets, we would encourage the Commission to consider including in the DSA package an \u2018umbrella provision\u2019 prohibiting the abuse of economic dependence, which could set out a non-exhaustive list of abusive practices, such as self-preferencing and refusal to grant access to data. This is an approach adopted by several Member States (e.g. Greece, Belgium, Germany) in order to fill the lacunae of the legal framework described above. Since the problem we are considering here is pan-European, a well-designed obligation prohibiting the abuse of economic dependence that is established in an EU instrument could address concerns arising from harmful platform practices. \nAnother solution is to adopt an approach similar to the Directive on unfair trading practices in business-to-business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain,  which includes a non-exhaustive list of unfair trading practices that are prohibited. This is similar to proposals made in a report recently published by the UK Consumer and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA proposes the establishment of an enforceable code of conduct for platforms that would be based around three high-level objectives. One of those objectives is fair trading, which \u2018is intended to address concerns around the potential for exploitative behaviour on the part of the [\u2026] platform\u2019.While our responses have focused on digital platforms, our experience of the UK markets regime is that structural issues can appear across a wide range of markets.","432":"The Commission currently takes action under Article 102 TFEU in order to address competition concerns arising from the conduct of a \u2018dominant\u2019 company. However, as already explained above (and as the Commission seems to acknowledge), problems may arise from the conduct of a non-dominant platform that qualifies as a gatekeeper. As a result, we find that there is a gap in the enforcement of Article 102 TFEU. ","433":"Moreover, intervention under Article 102 TFEU takes place ex post facto and is targeted at firm-specific behavior. Structural issues are not, necessarily, the result of unilateral action by a firm and are therefore not suited to be tacked under Art 102. However, in the case of markets that display systemic failures going beyond the conduct of a particular company due to certain structural characteristics (e.g. high concentration and entry barriers, customer lock-in, and lack of access to data), intervention may be needed to ensure that the consumer\/citizen is not deprived of the benefits of competition.NA.See questions 19.1 and 23.1.See questions 19.1 and 23.1.","434":"Although we cannot exclude that the New Competition Tool would be useful if it were horizontal in nature (i.e. if it applied to all sectors\/markets), we find that it is mostly needed in markets\/sectors that possess the characteristics the Commission identifies (e.g. high concentration ratios). As mentioned above, we have experienced structural competition problems in telecommunications and digital markets and we find that such markets should be covered by the tool.We replied \u2018no\u2019 to the above question because we have experienced structural competition problems in telecommunications markets, which regulatory policy has treated as distinct from digital\/platform markets. \nThe Commission asks whether the New Competition Tool should only apply to digital markets. The Commission defines the term \u2018digital markets\u2019 as \u2018markets largely relying on digital technologies with certain specific characteristics, such as extreme economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, zero pricing and data dependency\u2019. The overwhelming majority of markets are affected by the process of digitisation and have to a certain extent the characteristics described above. For those reasons, if the Commission intends to limit the application of the new tool to \u2018digital markets\u2019, we would strongly encourage it to define the term in a manner that is precise in order to ensure legal certainty.We find that, while non-binding recommendations to companies could be an instrument the Commission could use in the context of an inquiry under the New Competition Tool, proposing codes of conduct and best practices may not deliver the desired outcome. Drafting voluntary codes of conduct and best practices would be a lengthy exercise and entail high monitoring costs. Moreover, there would also need to be a mechanism ensuring effective enforcement of such codes. However, certain markets with structural competition problems, such as digital markets, are moving at a fast pace, rendering non-binding recommendations to companies inadequate to resolve the structural competition problems identified by the Commission (e.g. \u2018tipping\u2019). ","435":"As regards the second option, though we do not exclude that recommendations\/proposals to sectorial regulators could be useful to address certain issues that would arise from an inquiry under the New Competition Tool, the Commission would need to provide further information about this option. To our understanding, the New Competition Tool would be used by the Commission only. Would that option imply that the Commission would identify structural competition problems and subsequently ask sectorial regulators to oversee the implementation of the remedies the Commission would impose on platforms operating in certain markets? Or would the New Competition Tool also be used by National Competition Authorities?","436":"More particularly, following a thorough investigation under the New Competition Tool, which would enable it to gain a deep understanding of the market under scrutiny, the Commission may find that certain issues would be best addressed by regulation. It must be noted that many competition authorities across the EU have the power to make legislative recommendations where they find that regulation (or lack thereof) may prevent competition from flourishing. ","437":"Finally, for the reasons set out above, we find that imposing remedies on companies to deal with identified structural competition problems would be more effective than non-binding recommendations and proposals to those same companies. However, the Commission must ensure that such remedies are well-designed and that an effective monitoring mechanism exists to ensure that they are implemented in an effective manner.The markets where we experience structural competition problems are very complex. As a result, where it decides to apply the New Competition Tool, the Commission should not be restricted to one or the other type of remedies that it may impose under the current competition rules. ","438":"However, we note that behavioural remedies, such as remedies to grant access to a valuable input on objective criteria and fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, have not proved to be very successful. We would therefore encourage the Commission to conduct extensive research into the drawbacks of such remedies (e.g. scope, temporal application, monitoring mechanism) in order to ensure that they address the problems they seek to resolve. ","439":"Related to the above, we note that, under Article 9(2) of Regulation 1\/2003, the Commission may, upon request or on its own initiative, reopen the commitments proceedings where there has been a material change in any of the facts on which the decision was based; where the undertakings concerned act contrary to their commitments; or where the decision was based on incomplete, incorrect or misleading information provided by the parties. We find that the Commission should have the same powers when it imposes remedies under the New Competition Tool (as we also find that the Commission can make more extensive use of Article 9(2) of Regulation 1\/2003).","440":"Broadly speaking, behavioural remedies do not reduce the incentive to act anti-competitively. This may explain why, in its Merger Remedies Study, the Commission found that, compared to behavioural remedies, structural solutions were more effective. More particularly, the Commission found that in the cases where structural remedies were imposed on the merging parties, \u201894% of the divested businesses were still operating and therefore exercising some degree of competitive constraint on the merged entity\u2019. That same study found that behavioural remedies aiming to grant access to IPRs or know-how have deterred rather than encouraged market entry, the prices charged by the wholesaler being \u2018the single most essential element affecting the effectiveness of licensing remedies\u2019. Without excluding the potential of behavioural remedies to address structural competition problems, more research is needed to identify why behavioural remedies imposed on companies operating in digital markets (or markets with similar characteristics) have not delivered the desired results (see also our reply to Question 31.1.). \nMoreover, in the case of online platforms, which are often vertically and\/or diagonally integrated, structural remedies may be more effective than behavioural remedies. For example, as the study on \u2018Online Platforms and Digital Advertising\u2019 recently published by the UK CMA notes, \u2018following structural separation, independently-owned firms would not have the incentive to trade in a way that favours their own businesses, and will have independent incentives to innovate in new products or new technologies\u2019. The CMA further discusses other forms of separation, such as operational separation, which would include management separation and \u2018firewalls\u2019 between different businesses under common ownership.  We would strongly encourage the Commission to consider such solutions as they could address concerns relevant to digital markets\/markets that tend to \u2018tip\u2019 towards a single winner. \nCommission (2005).

If at all, a smarter and more \nefficient application of the existing tools is required. ","442":"The introduction of the NCT instrument bears the inherent risk of creating legal uncertainty and causing \nunwanted  side-  and  spillover  effects  which  could  have  a  chilling  effect  on  the  competitiveness  of \nEuropean companies.  To the extent that digitalization really raises additional concerns that cannot be \nadequately dealt with by existing tools, these should at most be supplemented by measures focused on \nand  tailored  to  very  large,  dominant  digital  platforms  while  maintaining  and  providing  sufficient  legal \ncertainty for potentially affected companies.   ","443":"In  Section  A  of  the  Consultation,  the  European  Commission  notes  that  \u201c[t]he  proposal  for  a  New \nCompetition Tool is one of the measures aimed at fulfilling this task [Commissioner Vestager\u2019s tasks in \nthe mission letter] by addressing gaps in the current EU competition rules and allowing for timely and \neffective  intervention  against  structural  competition  problems  across  markets.\u201d  The  European \nCommission  goes  on  to  state  that  \u201c[t]he  Commission\u2019s  enforcement  experience  in  both  antitrust  and \nmerger cases in various industries points to the existence of structural competition problems that cannot \nbe tackled under the EU competition rules while resulting in inefficient market outcomes.\u201d ","444":"The European Commission\u2019s further explanation of the types  of situations that in its view require the \nintroduction  of  the  NCT  instrument  are  clearly  focused  on  digital  markets,  in  particular  those \ncharacterized by large platforms who become or have become gatekeepers for digital- and non-digital \nproducts  and  services.  To  justify  the  extension  of  the  NCT  instrument  more  widely,  the  European \nCommission merely states that \u201c[w]hile these characteristics are typical for digital markets, they can also \nbe found in non-digital markets\u201d, with only the thinnest of arguments that the increasing digitalization of \nthe economy requires the NCT instrument to cover the whole economy.  ","445":"In our view, this is manifestly not a sufficient basis on which to introduce such a profound change to the \nEU  competition  rules.  We  agree  with  the  characterization  of  the  NCT  instrument  by  a  well-known \ncommentator: \u201cThe impact of this \u201ctool\u201d on competition law and policy would be impossible to overstate. \nIt would be likely to change competition law as we know it, and as developed over decades of thinking, \ndebate, precedent and experience1.\u201d  ","446":"In addition, the  European  Commission\u2019s current power to conduct sector inquiries  already allows the \nEuropean Commission to conduct deep probes into specific industries. Even though the instrument of \nthe sector inquiry per se does not give the European Commission the possibility to impose remedies, \nsuch remedies of course can be imposed if breaches of the competition law rules are revealed in the \ncourse of a sector inquiry. This shows that the current instruments are sufficient since there would not \nbe any justification to impose remedies on companies that are not in breach of competition law. ","447":"Article 103 TFEU allows the enactment of legislation to \u201cgive effect to the principles set out in Articles \n101 and 102\u201d. However, the NCT, instead of giving effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and \n102 TFEU rather provides for an ex ante intervention without the requirement for a prior infringement of \ncompetition law. It therefore creates new competition enforcement powers for which Art. 103 TFEU is \nnot a sufficient legal basis. ","448":"Article 114 TFEU is the legal basis for a harmonization of national laws of the Member States in order \nto avoid a fragmentation of the internal market. However, according to the Roadmap, the NCT does not \naim at removing distortions of competition law but rather at eliminating structural deficits and risks that \nare below the thresholds of competition law. Therefore, also Article 114 TFEU is no adequate basis for \nthe introduction of a NCT. ","449":"In Section A of the Consultation, the European Commission notes that the current EU competition rules \nenable it to enforce against anticompetitive agreements under Article 101 TFEU and against abuses of \na dominant position under Article 102 TFEU. It then goes on to say that \u201c[t]he enforcement experience \nof the Commission and national competition authorities, and the reflection process on the fitness of the \nexisting competition rules have helped identify certain structural competition problems that these rules \ncannot tackle (e.g. monopolisation strategies by non-dominant companies with market power) or cannot \naddress in the most effective manner (e.g. parallel leveraging strategies by dominant companies into \nmultiple adjacent markets)\u201d.  ","450":"It is not obvious what the European Commission means by monopolisation strategies by non-dominant \ncompanies with market power \u2013 traditional competition law analysis would indicate that such strategies \nwould be doomed to failure, and if the concerns relate to digital platforms, we refer to our comments in \nSection E below. Moreover, also from a competition law perspective, it is a legitimate interest of a non-\ndominant company to strive to attract as many customers as possible and thus to become dominant. \nParallel leveraging strategies by dominant companies into multiple adjacent markets also appear to be \nprimarily a concern relating to very large, dominant digital platforms.  ","451":"The reason for, and the focus of, the current discussions and suggested changes to EU competition law \nare certain behaviors of very few, very large and dominant companies, that all have direct relations to \nconsumers. This is a very specific area \u2013 best dealt with under the current 102 TEUF tool box - and the \nissues arising in this setting cannot readily be transferred to other scenarios, and in particular not to the \nB2B  scenario  where  customers  are  significantly  more  sensitive  about  their  data,  often  insisting  on \nretaining control over their data and have considerable countervailing bargaining power. ","452":"New  digital  business  models  and  platform  solutions  are  continuing  to  emerge  in  Europe,  and  this \ninnovation and development should not be limited by restrictive regulations. The introduction of a NCT \ninstrument  would  create  a  lot  of  legal  uncertainty  and  likely  lead  to  a  limitation  of  development  and \ninnovation, in particular if highly innovative companies could later be \u201cpunished\u201d for their success via \nsuch  NCT  instrument.  This  would  be  counterproductive  for  competition  and  thus  for  customers\u2019 ","453":" \n \n\fopportunity  to  receive  the  best  and  most  innovative  products.  In  addition,  it  would  further  impede \nEuropean  platforms  from  closing  the  gap  to  their  big  US  and  Asian  incumbents  which  do  not  face \nsimilarly strict regulations in their home markets thus hampering the desired level playing field which is \nso important for the competitiveness of European players. ","454":"Taking  into  account  the very dynamic environment  and development  in the area of platforms,  it  is in \naddition very likely that the NCT instrument cannot be defined specifically enough to ensure that it will \nonly apply to \u201every large online platforms\u201d. Thus, there will likely be spill-over effects to smaller players \nand emerging innovators and to traditional industries. The example of the market investigation tool in \nthe UK and recent comments from Commissioner Vestager show that the application of such tools will \nhardly be limited in practice to the very large, dominant digital players but to all sort of companies. This \nis also shown by the Commission\u2019s quote mentioned above. ","455":"Furthermore,  we  believe  it  is  important  that  the  NCT  instrument  should  not  be  used  to  lessen  the \nprocedural  or  evidential  burden  that  the  European  Commission  is  subject  to  in  proceedings  under \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU. We note with concern that the European Commission seems to suggest \nthat the upside of the introduction of the NCT instrument would be to deal with some of the \u201cproblems\u201d \nin traditional competition law enforcement: \u201cThe Commission would continue to enforce Articles 101 and \n102 TFEU on a case-by-case basis against anti-competitive conduct of individual companies. It would \nalso  continue to conduct  sector inquiries,  which, however,  only empower the Commission  to  request \ninformation  necessary  for  giving  effect  to  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU  and  also  do  not  allow  the \nCommission to impose remedies outside the scope of individual infringement proceedings.\u201d We would \nconsider that the above-mentioned situation is not a \u201cproblem\u201d to be dealt with by the introduction of a \nnew instrument with extensive remedy powers without the need to show illegal conduct, but rather the \nreflection of the rule of law as it applies to EU competition law enforcement.  ","456":"Finally, it is important to note that, despite comparisons being drawn between the NCT instrument and \ne.g. the UK market investigation regime, we are not aware of any jurisdictions that have both ex ante \n(mandatory merger control) and ex post (e.g. Article 102 TFEU) enforcement of competition law and an \nNCT-type tool. Therefore, any attempt to justify the NCT instrument as reflecting similar instruments at \nnational level is not accurate.    ","457":"If  despite  the  lack  of  a  regulatory  gap  as  well  as  a  legal  basis  and  the  potential  negative  impact  on \nbusiness, innovation and market growth the European Commission still wishes to address the above-\nmentioned root cause of the concern, namely very large digital platforms, a very cautious and careful \napproach is key. ","458":"Either, the European Commission should consider following the German model of \u00a7 19a GWB-E (draft) \nand introduce specific rules for companies of paramount significance across markets. As in the German \nmodel, such additional rules should only apply to a company if the European Commission previously \nstated via a formal decision that the relevant company is such a \u201ccompany of paramount significance \nacross markets\u201d. In addition, any such specific rules should be clearly defined and limited as much as \npossible. This would help to create legal certainty for the affected companies.   ","459":"An  alternative  could  be  an  ex  ante  regulatory  instrument  focused  on  and  tailored  only  to  very  large, \ndominant  digital  platforms.  This  means  that  the  scope  of  application  of  such  regulatory  instruments \nshould be clearly and narrowly defined to very large, dominant digital platforms with significant market \npower only. In addition, if such ex ante regulations were to be introduced at all, they should in any case \nbe strictly limited to platforms with a strong focus on B2C relationships and therefore mere B2B platforms \nor industry platforms should in any case be exempted from such regulations. If one wants to opt for this \npath, we view the European Commission\u2019s Digital Services Act Package and related activities to be the ","460":"We do not believe that there is a need for an ex ante regulatory instrument to ensure fair and competitive \nmarkets with a view to delivering lower prices and higher quality, as well as more choice and innovation \nto  European  consumers,  because  the  existing  instruments  in  the  European  Commission\u2019s  toolbox \n(enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU) are sufficient for this purpose. If at all, a smarter and more \nefficient application of the existing tools is required.  ","461":"In  case the introduction  of  such ex ante regulations  is  considered  nevertheless,  a very  cautious and \ncareful approach is key. A clear distinction between B2C- and B2B-relationships must be included. Any \nex ante regulations must be strictly limited to platforms with a strong focus on B2C relationships and \ntherefore  mere  B2B  platforms  or  industry  platforms  must  in  any  case  be  exempted  from  such \nregulations. Moreover, ex ante regulations should be clearly defined and tailored as much as possible \nto very large, dominant  online platforms with gatekeeper function in order to be  proportionate, to not \ncreate legal uncertainty and to avoid harmful side and spill-over effects.  ","462":"The high-level goals of the EC\u2019s intended proposal for a new Digital Services Act are \u201cto reinforce the \ninternal  market  for  digital  services,  to  lay  down  clearer,  more  stringent,  harmonised  rules  for  their \nresponsibilities in order to  increase citizen\u2019s safety online and protect their fundamental rights, whilst \nstrengthening  the  effective  functioning  of  the  internal  market  to  promote  innovation,  growth  and \ncompetitiveness, particularly of European digital innovators, scale-ups, SMEs and new entrants.\u201d While \nmany of these goals are generally to be welcomed, it is noteworthy that very different aspects (some \nrather  content-focused,  others  more  directed  towards  consumer  protection  and  others  towards  the \nfunctioning of the market) are brought together in this Digital Services Act. ","463":"Considering the fast developing and growing digital business, we support the EC\u2019s intention to update \nthe current legal framework in the B2C area, especially the E-Commerce Directive (issued almost 20 \nyears  ago).  There  is  a  need  for  clear  and  proportionate  rules  to  create  safe  and  sustainable  digital \nenvironments  for  consumers  who  usually  lack  the  necessary  information  and  choices  to  take  an \ninformed \u201cconsent\u201d decision.  ","464":"\uf0b7  Generally, we do not see a necessity for an ex ante regulation of very large online platforms \nat this point in time (neither on EU level nor on national level) apart from the abovementioned \nconsumer  protection  amendments  to  the  existing  E-Commerce  Directive.  The  currently \nexisting  tools  (enforcement  of  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU)  are  sufficient  to  tackle  abusive \npractices of very large online platforms. Complaints and the sense of an underenforcement \nagainst large technology companies are not so much related to the available tools but rather \nto the lengthy proceedings.  ","465":"\uf0b7  The  description  of  the  \u201ccritical\u201d  platforms  included  in  the  summary  of  the  initiative  is  the \nfollowing:  \u201cA  few  very  large  online  platforms  account  for  a  very  large  share  of  the  digital \neconomy  in  the  EU.  Their  role  as  gatekeepers  between  businesses  and  consumers,  with \neconomic power and control over entire platform ecosystems, makes it all but impossible for \nrivals or new market entrants to compete.\u201d This shows that the measures should be targeted \nat dominant or even very large, dominant companies to which \u2013 without any doubt - the current \ntools in Art. 102 TFEU could be applied. Therefore, the current toolkit is sufficient. For example, \nif \u201cgatekeepers\u201d abuse their power (e.g. via unfair commercial platform-to-business practices \nincluding  in  the  view  of  the  EC  self-preferencing,  data  leveraging  and  distortion  of  fair \ncompetition and fair-trading conditions within online  platform ecosystems) we regard Article \n102 TFEU as an appropriate tool to discipline such behavior. ","466":"In addition, it seems to be early for such a massive intervention as the underlying legal and \neconomic  questions  are  still  very  controversial  and  by  far  not  mature  enough.  Also,  some \nmember states, e.g. Germany, are in the process of significantly extending the scope of their \ndominance legislation to adapt them to the digital world.  It would be  wise for the  European \nlegislator to wait for the first results from these national \u201cexperiments\u201d before acting.  ","467":"\uf0b7  The  reason  for,  and  the  focus  of,  the  current  discussions  and  suggested  changes  to  EU \ncompetition law are certain behaviors of very few, very large and powerful companies, that all \nhave  direct  relations  to  consumers. This is  a  very specific area \u2013  best dealt with under the \ncurrent 102 TEUF tool box - and the issues arising in this setting cannot readily be transferred \nto other scenarios, and in particular not to the B2B scenario.  ","468":"\uf0b7  New digital business models and platform solutions are continuing to emerge in Europe, and \nthis  innovation  and  development  should  not  be  limited  by  restrictive  regulations.  The \nintroduction of ex ante regulations in this area would create a lot of legal uncertainty and likely \nlead to a limitation of development and innovation, in particular if highly innovative companies \ncould  later  be  \u201cpunished\u201d  for  their  success  due  to  these  regulations.  This  would  be \ncounterproductive for competition and thus for customers\u2019 opportunity to receive the best and \nmost innovative products.  ","469":"\uf0b7  Taking into account the very dynamic environment and development in the area of platforms, \nit is very likely that the suggested ex ante regulations cannot be defined specifically enough to \nensure that they will only apply to \u201every large online platforms\u201d. Thus, there will likely be spill-\nover  effects  to  smaller  players  and  emerging  innovators  and  to  traditional  industries.  The \nexample of the market investigation tool in the UK and recent comments from Commissioner \nVestager show that the application of such tools will hardly be limited in practice to the very \nlarge, dominant digital players but to all sort of companies.  ","470":"In this context one should also bear in mind that there are many platform providers which do \nnot have a significant market share and which operate in a way that neither has a negative \nimpact on the market nor raises any other concerns and which might nevertheless be affected \nby  the  suggested  ex  ante  regulations.  At  least  in  relation  to  such  platform  providers,  the \nintroduction  of  ex  ante  regulations  would  be  disproportionate.  This  applies  all  the  more  for \nother traditional industries. ","471":"In addition, such ex ante regulations might further impede European platforms from closing \nthe gap to their big US and Asian incumbents which do not face similarly strict regulations in \ntheir  home  markets.  This  would  be  hampering  the  desired  level  playing  field  which  is  so \nimportant for the competitiveness of European players. ","472":"In addition, it is very questionable whether the suggested ex ante regulation could really lead \nto the changes intended by these regulations. Many customers of the \u201cvery large platforms\u201d \nare satisfied with the services and possibilities these platforms offer. Therefore, they will often \nhave  no  intention  to  switch  to  other  platform  providers  unless  those  other  platforms  offer \ninnovative  features  that  distinguish  them  from  existing  platforms.  It  is  unlikely  that  ex  ante \nregulations would have any impact on customer preferences and loyalty. ","473":"\uf02d  Thirdly, even a generally  applicable  list of Dos  and  Don\u2019ts  needs to  be  very clear and \nunderstandable to avoid legal uncertainty (e.g. scope and extent of measures). However, \ndigital  business  and  \u201cconnected  market  disruption\u201d  are  usually  case-specific,  so  that  a \ngeneric list of Dos and Don\u2019ts would most likely not be of much help.

It is important for the Commission to fully understand a market and ensure that structural competition problems exist because a company unlawfully exercised its market power.

Intervention under NCT that imposes any form of mandatory remedies must be predicated on substantive standards rooted in well-settled antitrust\/competition law precedent that are articulated in clear, predictable guidelines.  The absence of a rigorous legal standard coupled with extremely expansive views of what market features constitute \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d would mean intervention could be triggered and conduct prosecuted under the NCT in almost any market scenario.  In addition, the absence of a substantive standard would render judicial review meaningless and would allow the NCT to be used as an end-around obligations to prove infringements under Articles 101 and 102.\nSpecifically, the substantive test for determining whether intervention under NCT is permissible should require the EC to bear the burden of the following:\nFirst, demonstrating the conduct is highly likely or at least more likely than not to be anti-competitive in the foreseeable future (e.g., 3 years).  Especially because the NCT may be designed to scrutinise markets and companies where there is no alleged \u201cdominance\u201d, the legal standard for permitting intervention under NCT cannot be limited to establish that the conduct is \u201ccapable\u201d of being anti-competitive, or that there is a \u201crisk of\u201d anti-competitive outcomes or that this risk is \u201cplausible\u201d.\nIn addition, alleged harm beyond the foreseeable future (e.g., beyond 3 years) should carry with it a greater burden of proof that the chain of events is very likely to occur.\nSecond, demonstrating how intervention under NCT will meaningfully improve the alleged structural competition problem without causing more harm.  Remedial action on the basis of NCT intervention would need to be proportional to the alleged harm and cannot cause more competitive harm in the same or adjacent markets (in particular the potential for harming the incentive to invest and innovate) than what the remedy is intended to solve.  \nThe more mandatory and intrusive the remedy (e.g., divestitures and interoperability mandates), the higher the burden should be on the Commission to demonstrate the remedy is the most narrowly-tailored remedy possible to address the problem.","485":"Qualcomm does not believe that the implementation of a new competition tool is needed and, as explained in its separate response to the Digital Services Act public consultation, Qualcomm believes the establishment of an additional regulatory framework imposing obligations and prohibitions that are generally applicable to large online platforms with gatekeeper power is sufficient to address the competitive issues of greatest concern.","486":"However, in the case that an NCT is implemented, intervention should be limited digital platforms where gatekeeper power and market \u201ctipping\u201d issues are most prevalent.

The EC already has the ability to timely impose interim measures to addressed immediate harm, and has chosen to do so in a small number of cases. There is no justification to further expand the EC powers to allow the imposition of interim measures under an NCT, especially where there is the absence of an infringement of EU competition law.Qualcomm does not believe that the implementation of a new competition tool is needed, , and to the extent the NCT has the ability to make non-binding recommendations and proposals to companies, companies should be permitted to accept voluntary commitments or suggestions made by the EC under the NCT.Qualcomm does not believe that the implementation of a new competition tool is needed, implemented, market participants should have the ability to comment on the NCT\u2019s findings before a final decision.  Pre-decision factual input from the market is fundamental to the ability of the EC to make recommendations or decisions under the NCT.Qualcomm does not believe that the implementation of a new competition tool is needed, but to the extent a NCT is implemented, market participants should be permitted to comment on the appropriateness and proportionality of the contemplated remedies as they will bear the most direct impact of any such remedies.Qualcomm does not believe that the implementation of a new competition tool is needed, , but to the extent a NCT is implemented, intervention under NCT must be subject to rapid judicial review.  \nSpecifically, intervention using either (1) RFIs that require responses; and (2) mandatory remedies (especially structural remedies that are irreversible) must be subject to rapid judicial review.  Without judicial review, there would be no independent check on whether NCT is being appropriately applied under the law.  In these cases, the Courts should be able to suspend its execution.  Rapid review by the European Court of Justice would ensure that EC resolution remains timely for market participants.\nFurther, judicial review must be of whether NCT intervention is appropriate under the governing substantive\/legal standard (see Qualcomm\u2019s response to question 27).  If there is no substantive standard to serve as the basis of NCT intervention, then independent judicial review would be rendered meaningless.  Similarly, if the substantive standard is so amorphous as to allow NCT intervention in almost any situation, then judicial review would still be meaningless.\nIn sum, the more (1) (ambiguous) market characteristics are used as a trigger or justification for NCT intervention; and (2) the more responses to RFIs or imposition of remedies are mandatory; then (3) the greater the need for independent judicial review and the ability of parties to stay\/pause the imposition of the remedy while the appeal is pending.Qualcomm does not believe that the implementation of a new competition tool is needed,, as explained in its separate response to the Digital Services Act public consultation, Qualcomm believes the establishment of an additional regulatory framework imposing obligations and prohibitions that are generally applicable to large online platforms with gatekeeper power is sufficient to address the competitive issues of greatest concern.","489":"As part of its mobile devices, the company provides various digital goods and services, including apps, an app Gallery (app store), etc.See above response.The company relies on a variety of digital services in its operations, including in particular the Android Operating System which it uses for its smartphones and tablets.The factors we identify as \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d are typically present in digital markets. This is why, as indicated below, we believe that the NCT should focus on digital markets rather than other markets.The company considers that the most problematic scenario is linked with the presence of digital gatekeepers.  When digital platforms control access to a vast number of users, which do not multi-home, they will typically engage in abusive conducts. They may self-preference their own products or they may impose unfair trading conditions on the users of their platforms.\nA number of important markets are highly concentrated in the EU (e.g., Search, Social Networking, Consumer Electronics E-Commerce etc.). More should be done to facilitate entry into these markets so as to make these markets contestable. When these markets are not contestable, it is important to ensure that the dominant firms are not allowed to engage in exclusionary and\/or exploitative conducts. \nIn addition, the company believes that attempts by digital gatekeepers to extent their market power from one market to another market is also problematic. \nSee our response to question 8.3.This strategy raises competition concerns because it can eliminate competition in an otherwise competitive market. ","490":"The Commission needs to prevent a situation where a large number of digital markets are dominated by a handful of large big tech companies. \nWhile the enforcement of Articles 101-102 TFEU on an ad hoc basis should remain a core component of EU competition policy, the repeated infringements by Google of Article 102 TFEU suggest that other forms of intervention is needed.

Such tactics are hard to prosecute under Article 102 TFEU because the company in question may not have a dominant position at the time the anticompetitive conduct takes place. This creates an enforcement gap.","493":"Similar behavior may also occur in digital markets. While digital gatekeepers may be in a dominant position in their core market(s), they are also active in a wide range of markets in which they are not dominant yet. We are however concerned that these companies may find subtle ways to undermine rivals, for instance by reducing interoperability, depriving rivals of data, etc.See our response to question 10.3.There is an enforcement gap in EU competition law because Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance to be applicable. This is particularly problematic in digital markets since they can tip quickly with the damage to competition will be permanent.See our response to question 10.7.

This theory posits that the increased availability of information that results from \ndigitalisation enhances the risk of price hegemony based on tacit collusions, particularly in oligopolistic \nmarkets.  Nonetheless,  we  must  acknowledge  there  is  an  important  distinction  between  a  highly \ninformed market where price differences between competitors are very small because competition has \nmade such marginal differences significant and a market involving tacit agreements among competitors \nto restrict competition.

","517":" \n  \n \n \n\fThis is not saying that the existing regulatory toolbox is \u201cbulletproof\u201d and does not  need to be updated. \nFor  instance,  distinguishing  between  collusion  and  competition  in  oligopolistic  markets  where \ninformation  enables  algorithmic  pricing  decisions  may  be  an  area  where  that  key  distinction  can  be \nfacilitated by development of analytic techniques that make use of the very information that gives rise \nto    the  situation.  In  contrast,  it  is  saying  that  there  is  not  a  need  for  such  a  deep  legislative  reform, \nespecially the one entailed by the IIA, due to the uncertainties and incoherencies it would impose, but \npreferably a better use of the full panoply of instruments that the Commission already has at its disposal. ","518":"Equally, in the telecoms sector competition rules are also applicable and are a contributor to increased \ncompetition in a market traditionally identified for its tendency to form monopolies based on past state \nsponsored  incumbents.    Hence,  competition  legislation  is  conjugated  with  telecoms  own  regulatory \nframework and as stated by the Commission, \u201cone of the main features of the Telecoms Regulatory \nFramework  is  the  set-up  of  ex  ante  access  regulation,  which  consists  of  a  procedure  to  identify \ncompetitive  bottlenecks  in  telecoms  and  to  impose  remedies  to  address  such  bottlenecks,  following \ncompetition  law  principles  and  methodologies\u201d,  through    a  concise  implemented  processes  closely \nfollowed  by  both  the  NRAs  and  the  Commission.  It  is  also  very  important  to  stress  the  ongoing  EU \nlegislative initiatives towards the DSM involving a review of telecoms regulatory framework that aims at \ncreating  a  \u201creliable,  trustworthy,  high-speed,  affordable  networks  and  services  that  safeguard \nconsumers'  fundamental  rights  to  privacy  and  personal  data  protection  while  also  encouraging \ninnovation.\u201d This also requires a precise, certain and consolidated competition framework. ","519":"Having that said, consistently with the position we have been defending, we must conclude that in the \none hand the current competition legislation is proving to be very efficient, especially when coupled with \nadjacent regulations in addressing novel \u201cdigitalised\u201d problems in these specific sectors. On the other \nhand, as it was already shown, the NCT proposed by the Commission would be accompanied by a lot \nof uncertainty and discretionary powers that would put a stall on all the progress that is foreseeable to \nbe made. ","520":"According to the IIA the NCT would be complementary to the already existing competition legislation, \nwhich implies that they would, in certain measure, contend with  each other, in specific situations for \ndetermining with legal instrument would be applied, having in consideration that, according to the IIA, \nthe NCT would only be applicable where there is a gap in traditional legislation that could not (at least \neffectively) be resolved. Alongside the uncertainty and risks that this reality creates to companies, the \nmain difference between the instruments, at least the one that is transversal to all the Options proposed \nin the IIA, is that while the NCT could impose its structural and behavioral measures before the finding \nof an infringement, legitimated (allegedly) by an early and faster intervention, before the competition \nstructural problem occurs. Meanwhile, the existing regulatory framework requires the need to find an \ninfringement to impose remedies. ","521":"Analysing the fourth point, it looks like there is a confluence between the two legislative instruments. \nHowever, this is merely apparent, the reality is even worse, because as predicted by the NCT IIA the \nlegal basis for the new competition tool would be Articles 103 and 114 TFEU. Nonetheless, it is evident \nthat the scope of Article 114, regarding it being an appropriate legal basis for approximation measures, \nis settled on the fact that it removes or prevents distortions of competition by developing conditions of \nthe  functioning  of  the  internal  market.  Now,  if  we  look  at  the  aim  of  the  NCT  IIA,  it  is  not  based  on \neliminating distortions of competition, but rather eliminating structural risks that cannot (allegedly) be \ntackled by the existing regulatory framework for competition law. ","522":"We  also  need  to  consider  that  the  options  (from  bottom  to  top)  become  increasingly  severe  and \nempower,  each  time  more,  the  Commission.  Generally  speaking,  we  come  from  a  position  that \nconsiders that it is disproportionate that the Commission should have the power to impose structural or \nbehavioral remedies without the need of having to find an infringement, based solely on the finding of \na  structural  competition  problem.  Alongside  the  different  view  on  current  structural  competition \nproblems, with the market constantly evolving, anything defined as structural problem could be tackled \nby one these options, which is extremely discretionary and would definitely culminate in an uncertainty \nfor companies to know whether they are or not in such situations, resulting in decreased incentive to \ninvest and prejudicing the consumers.  ","523":"The question itself can be perceived as paradoxical: of course, that if the Commission should be able \nto impose remedies through the NCT (contradictorily to what we defend), they should be appropriate \nand proportionate. Now, the real question that poses is that if it is possible for the Commission to pursue \nthese objectives with the intended scope of the NCT. ","524":"Contrasting with the normal sieves of the application of Articles 101 and 102, it is evident the absence \nof  a  sense  of  proportionality,  much  more  evident  when  we  realize  that  contrary  to  the  existing  legal \nframework, there is not a need to find an infringement. An \u201cearly intervention\u201d whenever the Commission \nconcludes there is a \u201cthreat to competition\u201d does not suffice. ","525":"Another  consideration,  attentive  to  NCT  IIA  reference  that  even  though  the  Commission  is  being \nenabled  to  impose  behavioural  and  structural  remedies,  it  would  not    impose  fines  \u201cand  thus  not \ngenerate rights to launch damage claims\u201d. This situation leaves the impression that by the fact that the \nCommission does not impose fines it is being \u201chelpful\u201d towards the undertakings. Nonetheless, we must ","526":"Finally,  concerning  this  aspect,  we  cannot  forget  that  the  proposed  NCT  has  the  ability  to  propose \nstricter remedies, even without having to find any infringement or the indication of one. Comparing two \npotential  situations  we  could  have  scenarios  where  an  undertaking  after  the  Commission  finds  an \ninfringement that falls into the existing regulatory framework may adopt a commitment in the terms of \nArticle 9 of Regulation 1\/2003, while an undertaking without a dominant position and without committing \nany wrongdoing could be subjected to impositions regarding structural or behavioural remedies. This \nmeans that companies might face stricter remedies, with less procedural rights, without committing any \ninfringement. Besides being outrageously disproportionate this situation does not meet the standards \nof Fundamental and Constitutional rights. ","527":"It is also imperative that we realise that the introduction of a NCT, as described by the IIA, would surely \nconstitute  a  lot  of  legal  uncertainty  and  incoherencies,  constricting  the  innovation  and  dynamism \npotential for enterprises that would be limited or even punished for being successful and outdoing their \ncompetitors,  even  though  fair  competition,  solely  because  they  could  became  \u201cmarket  dominant\u201d. \nUltimately, this situation would turn into a vicious cycle leading to disincentive to invest, therefore less \ninnovation and competition, with the spill-over effects to smaller and new-coming enterprises, resulting \nin far worst conditions for consumers.  ","528":"40. Taking into consideration the parallel consultation on a proposal in the context of \nthe Digital Services Act package for ex ante rules to ensure that markets characterised by \nlarge platforms with significant network effects acting as gatekeepers remain fair and \ncontestable for innovators, businesses, and new market entrants, please rate the suitability of \neach option below to address market issues raised by online platform ecosystems. ","529":"* 40.1. Please explain which of the options, or combination of these, in your view would be \nsuitable and sufficient to address the contestability issues arising in the online platforms \necosystems.. \nThroughout the questionnaire we maintained a consistent position defending that there is not a need \nfor the introduction of a NCT. Quite contrarily, we asserted several times that the existing toolbox is \nstill adequate and sufficient. Therefore, the suitable option, amongst those presented, could only be \nthe one that predicts that \u201ccurrent competition rules are enough to address issues raised in digital \nmarkets\u201d. ","530":"In fact, to date, there is a lack of evidence-based claims that the TFEU leaves a material enforcement \ngap regarding anti-competitive unilateral conduct, even in the scenarios described by the Commission. \nAs  previously  shown,  contrarily  to  what  the  Commission  indicates,  the  existing  framework  for  EU \ncompetition law has proven to be singularly effective at treating new and complex issues, even those \nthat  potentially  arise  in  digital-enabled  markets  -  two-sided-markets,  zero-price  factors  \u2013  between \nothers, like shown in several court-cases (see above point 7.1). The Commission could ponder an active \nincrease  in  the  use  of  these  current  tools.  Further  we  believe  that  zero-pricing  market  may  not  be ","531":" \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fimportant as a reason for a structural competition problem. Zero-pricing is only a way in which services \nand products are provided, and this is usually the common case in digital markets. Besides, in a zero-\npricing market, the customers are usually sensitive to price changes, which means that the undertaking \nwill quickly lose customers once they charge a price. ","532":"Having  that  said,  it  is  therefore  recommendable  that  the  Commission,  before  committing  to  a  big \nregulatory reform, should do a more efficient use of the existing competition tools under Articles 101 \nand  102  TFEU,  as  well  as  the  merger  control  regime  that  it  has  at  its  disposal,  which  constitutes  a \nsufficient way to resolve main competition concerns across markets (even those extended to the digital \nera). Moreover, the current \u201ctoolbox\u201d has much more potential than what it is recognized for by the \u201cNCT \nIIA\u201d. Mainly through the application of the Regulation 1\/2003 which implements the rules on competition \nlaid  down  in  Articles  101 and  102 TFEU, especially Articles  7,  8 (Interim  Measures) and 17 (Sector \nInquiries).  All  these  articulated  with  increasing  national  legislative  initiatives  and  EU  legislation \nconcerning specific sectors competition rules form a well-oiled mechanism that has proven its efficiency \nthroughout decades. ","533":"Even if this was not  the case, the NCT has structural problems of its own: Starting by poorly identifying \nthe  structural  competition  problems  that  would  represent  its  cause,  as  it  was  argued  in  point  7.1; \nfollowed by an inaccurate prediction or even potential to go beyond the existing European competition \nlegislation,  concentrated  in  three  situations:  the  overlapping  of  the  existing  regulatory  framework \n(Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and merger control regime); the overlapping of the Commission proposed \nex  ante  regulatory  tool  and  even  an  overlapping  with  Member  States  (expected)  national  legislative \ninitiatives. It is concerning that the NCT roadmap fails to explain the relationship between an NCT and \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU and that a number of questions in the NCT questionnaire ask whether these \nArticles are suitable and sufficiently effective. This is all the more so because the options set out in the \nNCT roadmap appear to target exclusively or to a very substantial extent single firm conduct but without \nproviding the substantive and procedural safeguards enshrined in Article 102 TFEU. Absent adequate \nstandards and safeguards, this creates an incentive to bring cases under the NCT instead of Article 102 \nTFEU. ","534":"ICC supports enforcement objectives that are aimed at stopping specific infringements of competition \nlaw.  However,  the  proposals  of  the  Commission  (options  1  to  4)  do  not  relate  to  infringements  of \ncompetition law and related possible inadequacies of enforcement of competition law, but rather they \npartly (options 3 and 4) address issues below the radar of competition law scrutiny, in particular below \nthe established intervention thresholds for the control of abuse of a dominant position, and outside of \nconcrete infringements (all options), whereby there is even talk of a structural reorganisation of markets \nand the market players by the Commission (\"market by design\").  ","535":"In  view  of  the  ongoing  and  open  question,  if  there  is  a  need  for  action,  the  open  and  wide  circle  of \naddressees, a dubious legal basis and, above all, serious problems under EU law, competition policy, \nconstitutional law and the rule of law, particularly with regard to the planned structural and non-abusive ","536":"ICC does not believe that there is a need for the NCT to ensure fair and competitive markets with a \nview to delivering lower prices and higher quality, as well as more choice and innovation to \nconsumers, because the existing instruments in the European Commission\u2019s toolbox (enforcement of \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU) are sufficient for this purpose. If at all, a smarter and more efficient \napplication of the existing tools is required. ","537":"New digital business models and platform solutions are continuing to emerge, and this innovation and \ndevelopment should not be limited by restrictive regulations. The introduction of the NCT would create \na lot of legal uncertainty and likely lead to a limitation of development and innovation, in particular if \nhighly innovative companies could later be \u201cpunished\u201d for their success. This would be \ncounterproductive for competition and thus for customers\u2019 opportunity to receive the best and most \ninnovative products. ","538":"The enforcement of the NCT by the Commission should require adequate and appropriate investigative \npower  in  order  for  the  decisions  to  be  based  on  precise  and  reliable  information  and  objective  and \nrobust  economic  analysis.  Investigative  powers  will  enable  the  Commission  to  assess  the  market, \nunderstand its dynamics, and more importantly, to make the most appropriate and effective decisions. \nMoreover,  with  the  possibility  of  these  investigative  measures,  the  remedies  imposed  by  the \nCommission will be more readily accepted by the stakeholders and will face less criticism if they are \nbased on sound information. ","539":"Indeed, we understand that the purpose of the NCT is to tackle structural risks to competition, especially \nin quickly evolving markets.  Therefore, to be effective on dynamic markets such as digital platforms, \nthe Commission must act quickly before the structural damage is no longer reversible and\/or before the \ndynamic has made the approach of the Commission irrelevant. ","540":"Moreover,  being subject to binding  legal deadlines also implies legal certainty for stakeholders. The \nfirms  will  know  how  long  the  Commission\u2019s  investigation  will  last,  and  the  shareholders  will  have  a \ncertain predictability regarding the future of their company and their share prices. Indeed, a tool that \nenables the Commission to impose dramatic and even structural remedies  would  greatly impact the \nvalue of the companies. In the tech sector where investors must have an exit plan,  it is essential to \navoid a \u2018sword of Damocles\u2019 threatening the future value of a company for years.  ","541":"Indeed,  the  NCT  would  allow  the  Commission  to  impose  measures  on  companies  that  have  not \ncommitted any anti-competitive practices. Today, to impose interim measures, the Commission must at \nleast prove the existence of a prima facie illegal behavior; this test would not even exist in the case of \nthe NCT.  ","542":"Moreover,  because  of  they  are  based  on  an  in-depth  investigation,  interim  measures  can  be \npronounced even if unwarranted. That is especially dangerous given that they can slow down or even \nimpede the development of a growing business. This can lead to a loss of dynamism in the company, \na loss of income, or even an exit from the market, those consequences being unacceptable.    ","543":"In light of the above, ICC suggests, instead of allowing for interim measures, to use shorter (but still \nreasonable) deadlines when the structural risks to competition are imminent. In any event, in an interim \nmeasures NCT framework these must be subject to a number of safeguards such as judicial approval \nby the EU General Court, and subject to a legal test similar to that used widely by courts for an interim \ninjunction \u2013 that is (1) significant likelihood that a permanent remedy will be imposed (2) significant risk \nof harm that won\u2019t be able to be reversed, (3) balance of convenience in favour of intervention, and (4) \nfull opportunity for the parties affected to be heard.  ","544":"This will speed up the proceedings and the measures will be more effective. Moreover, it will lower the \ncost  of  the  Commission\u2019s  investigations.    However,  as  in  commitments  considered  in  the  context  of \nmergers  or  behavioural  infringements,  the  Commission  will  need  to  be  satisfied  that  the  voluntary \ncommitments are sufficient to resolve the concerns raised, do not raise material additional concerns on \ntheir own, and are able to be monitored in the medium to long term. The Commission should plan to \nconsult widely on any measures before they are accepted. ","545":"The market test should be the Commission\u2019s main investigative tool. Further it is surely sensible and \nnecessary to allow affected businesses to comment  on remedies that have a  major impact on them \nbefore  they  are  imposed  \u2013  the  experience  in  the  UK  is  that  this  is  an  extremely  important  and \nconstructive part of the UK regime, where much of the engagement occurs to try to shape a sensible \nremedy  that  resolves  the  competition  concern  but  limits  the  risk  of  disproportionate  and  unforeseen \nconsequences.  It does take some time, but this trade off tends to be worth it rather than the market \nhaving  to  deal  with  disproportionately  expensive  or  ineffective  interventions,  or  their  unforeseen \nconsequences, for years to come. ","546":"We consider that consulting the market stakeholders to assess if there is a structural risk to competition \nin a market is a necessary requirement. Still, consulting them on the appropriateness and proportionality \nof the remedies envisaged by the Commission will increase the length of the proceedings. The aim of \nthe NCT is to act swiftly to readjust the market before it is too late. It seems like this consultation will \nhave the opposite effect of the one expected.  ","547":"It is important to emphasise that the NCT would be used by the Commission without any infringement \nof competition law. The Commission would be at risk of violating the companies\u2019 fundamental rights, \nsuch as the presumption of innocence and right to property. The EU is founded on the rule of law and \nthere are strong traditions in EU competition law for ensuring procedural fairness and protecting rights \nof  defense.  The  envisaged  NCT  would  be  highly  intrusive  and  far  reaching.  It  would  empower  the \nCommission  to  impose  intrusive  behavioral  and  possibly  even  structural  remedies.    Such  measures \nwould  therefore  need  to  be  subject  to  strong  internal  checks  and  balances,  as  well  as  procedural \nsafeguards that protect rights of defense effectively.  ","548":"The NCT should  also consider  as a subsidiary alternative  procedural safeguard, to the  Commission \nrequesting such decisions from the EU General Court, the use of an independent decision-making panel \nwhere initial concerns are identified and an in-depth review is warranted. This is a fundamental feature \nof the UK markets regime, where the Phase 1 review (a market study) is carried out by CMA staff under \nthe supervision of the executive of the CMA, but a Phase 2 review (an in-depth market investigation, ","549":" \n  \n \n\fwhich can result in remedies) is  led by  a  panel of  independent  experts  appointed  by the CMA, with \nsupport from CMA staff.  This independence of decision-making helps the CMA process be seen as \ngenerally fair and largely insulated from allegations of political interference or bias. The ICC expects a \nsimilar process could be a significant mitigant to similar concerns in the EU. ","550":"In  the  same  line,  judicial  oversight  of  the  Commission  proceedings  and  its  decisions  is  essential  to \nensure a perception of high quality and objective decision-making and respect for the companies\u2019 rights.  \nFor example, core to the credibility of the UK market investigations process is a right to request review \nby the specialist Competition Appeals Tribunal, comprising experienced judges and other experts with \nsignificant experience  in competition law and economics. This appellate body  has the expertise  and \nresource to engage in detail with the detailed economic analysis carried out by the CMA in its market \ninvestigation, and thereby helps to ensure that a review is based on the merits of the underlying factual \nissues, rather than on narrow procedural and legal grounds of judicial review. ","551":"But ICC\u2019s proposal goes further. Given the danger of harm to fundamental rights, the risk of decisions \nbeing (or being seen to be) politically motivated, and probability that interventions motivated by fixing \nissues of competition could easily affect a number of other policy areas (including, for example, freedom \nof speech, press freedom, privacy, taxation and geopolitical matters) we propose that the Commission \nshould not receive the power to  pronounce itself decisions such as imposing remedies. Instead, the \nCommission  should  have  to  request  such  decisions  from  the  EU  General  Court.  This  will  avoid  any \nissues with the impartiality of the Commission. ","552":"One  of  the  apparently  central  structural  competition  problems  that  the  Commission  aims  to  fix  are \n\u201cGatekeeper scenarios\u201d. After a meticulous analysis of The Special Advisors\u2019 report and the Inception \nImpact Assessment itself, there is an overall indication that the main focus of the Commission regarding \nthis aspect are large online platforms (not necessarily dominant but with extensive market power) that \ncontrol the platform ecosystem being \u201cthe market dynamics only determined by the gatekeeper\u201d. The \nnotions  appointed  by  the  Commission  are  particularly  directed  to  the  fact  that  these  \u201cgatekeepers\u201d \ncontrol the market and are able to eliminate competitors due to its monopolized position.  ","553":"Also, as some of the Options described in the IIA predict, there is a predisposition from the Commission \nto departure from the pre-conditions incorporated in the existing regulatory framework, more precisely \nArticles 101 and 102, for the need to establish dominance, that would accelerate the procedures by not \nbeing limited to normal sieves of determining the dominant position through a fairly archaic process.  ","554":"In this context, the real question is raised: what we have in our hands is really a gap within the current \nEU legislation that exempts some \u201cgatekeepers\u201d from the competition law? Or this question only \nemerges due to the fact that the main tool for assessing dominance must updated? Of course, that \nthe control of considerable market shares conjugated with entry barriers and concentration are good \nindicators of market power, but if the problem is that its concentration of market shares doesn\u2019t reach ","555":" \n  \n \n\fthe value of 40%, maybe we should change this paradigm, not basing the establishment of a \ndominant position on the assessment of market shares, but rather on more dynamic and modernized \nevidences. Therefore, if we look, for instance, to the definition of dominance in case-law Hoffman La \nRoche, that is more integrative, concerned with the actual strength presented by an undertaking that \nwould potentially cease relevant competition on a given market and have an \u201cappreciable influence on \nthe conditions under which that competition will develop\u201d the gatekeeper position could fall under this \nstandard, and therefore, we would be re-railed to normal EU competition law procedures. Having that \nsaid, before a big legislative reform with such undetermined impacts in the economy and the \nconsumers, there should be a further assessment on the question presented. ","556":"One  must  acknowledge  the  modernisation  of  the  world  and  its  economy.  The  interactions  between \ncompanies and consumers have become much more facilitated due to the digitalisation of processes. \nEveryone is a click away from everything. Nonetheless, this new reality is not only apparent in the Digital \nMarkets  but  has  spread  over  other  (more  traditional)  markets.  In  this  regard  it  is  imperative  that \ncompetition remains transparent and inclusive. The existence of an established regulation that support \nthis phenomenon while ensuring fair and competitive market conditions is crucial to preserve innovation \nand to protect consumers welfare. ","557":"This reality then raises the question of knowing, as said by the Commission Vice-President Vestager, \nwhether \u201cthe competition policy and rules are fit for the modern economy\u201d1. In this regard, the European \nCommission points out  a broad range of structural competition problems that can be agglomerated in \ntwo  categories:  \u201cStructural  risks  for  competition\u201d  referring  to  \u201cscenarios  where  certain  market \ncharacteristics  (\u2026)  and  the  conduct  of  the  companies  in  the  markets  concerned  create  a  threat  for \ncompetition\u201d either trough \u201cthe creation of powerful market players with an entrenched market and\/or \ngatekeeper position (\u2026)\u201d2 or \u201cunilateral strategies by non-dominant companies to monopolise a market \nthrough anti-competitive means\u201d3. Or, Structural lack of competition, referring to \u201cmarkets displaying \nsystemic failures going beyond the conduct of a particular company with market power due to certain \nstructural features such as high concentration and entry barriers, consumer lock-in, lack of access to \ndata or data accumulation, and oligopolistic market structures with an increased risk for tacit collusion \n(\u2026)\u201d4. According to the Commission these structural problems consist in gaps that the current regulation \ncannot  fill  (at  all  or  effectively).  This  concerns  \u201cthe  baseline  scenario\u201d  -  consisting  in  the  current  EU \ncompetition law framework through the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.  ","558":"In this context, the Commission took the initiative to present policy options for stakeholders to consider. \nThese should be applied complementarily to existing regulations: they have in common the fact that in \nall these options the Commission would be able to act without the need to find an infringement. Options \n(1)  and  (2)  share  the  fact  that  there  is  still  a  need  for  the  undertaking  to  be  considered  dominant, \nsomething  that  is  not  necessary  in  options  (3)  and  (4)  which  means  that  in  these  scenarios,  the \nCommission can (hypothetically) impose structural remedies to undertakings without the need of finding \nan infringement and without the need for them to be considered dominant, intervening beforehand. In \noptions (1) and (3) there\u2019s a horizontal scope, meaning that this tool would be applied to all markets, ","559":"Having this broad sense of the questions presented by the \u201cNCT IIA\u201d, one can now focus on some of \nthe issues that the introduction of this tool could have on  the EU competition policy, whether it is for \nthe  consumers  or  for  the  willingness  to  invest,  directly  affecting  innovation  and  competition  itself.  A \nlarger emphasis will be given to certain topics that will be densified: (i) Overlap of Regulations (within \nthe Digital Services Act, colliding with the ex ante regulation; also colliding with the \u201cbaseline scenario\u201d \nof Articles 101 and article 102 of the TFUE and national legislation), (ii) the (\u201cfar-reaching\u201d) Scope of \nthe  \u201cNew  Competition  Tool\u201d,  (iii)  Conflict  with  Fundamental  and  Constitutional  Rights;  and  (iv) \nInsufficiency of Legal Basis. ","560":"This specific topic raises several questions of its own: Is there (according to the structural competition \nrisks presented by the Commission) a gap that needs to be filled with a new toolbox as the Commission \nproposes?  Or  is  the  current  legal  framework  sufficiently  flexible  and  malleable  to  be  applied \ntransversally to the modern digitally-enabled markets? If enacted, what would the thresholds between \nthe current legislation and the \u201cNCT\u201d be without them overlapping? And between the \u201cNCT\u201d and the ex \nante regulatory tool? National legislative initiatives must also be considered in this regard. ","561":"As seen, the Commission identifies two types of structural competition problems (as  shown above \u2013 \npoint 2) consisting in \u201cstructural risks for competition\u201d and \u201cstructural market failure\u201d5. Nonetheless, to \ndate,  there  is  a  lack  of  evidence-based  claims  that  the  TFEU  leaves  a  material  enforcement  gap \nregarding anticompetitive unilateral conduct, even in the scenarios described by the Commission. In \nfact,  according  to  Article  102  TFEU,  the  Commission  has  clear  powers  and  the  authority  to  impose \nbehavioral and structural remedies when there is a breach of the Article itself. Also, the European Courts \nhave systematically considered that unilateral conduct is only applicable, according to the scope of EU \ncompetition law, if the undertaking is dominant. ","562":"Considering this, contrary to what the Commission indicates, the existing framework for EU competition \nlaw has proven to be singularly effective at treating new and complex issues, even those that arise in \ndigital-enabled markets - two-sided-markets, zero-price factors \u2013 between others, like shown in several \ncases:  Case  AT.  39740  Google  Search  (Shopping)  that  confronted  fair  new  theories  of  harm  - \nleveraging  strategies;  Case  AT.  40099  \u2013  Google  Android  and  Case  M.8124  Microsoft\/LinkedIn \n(tying);  Case  AT.  40411  \u2013  Google  AdSense  (exclusivity  requirements),  even  cases  of  economic \ndependency\/relative market power (General Motors Continental NV v Commission, C-26\/75). ","563":" \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn parallel the Commission may ponder, if so deemed required, the review and update of various of its \nGuidelines  and  Notices  (e.g.  the  current  consultation  into  the  Market  Definition  Notice,  and  similarly \nsupport updates to the Horizontal and Vertical Guidelines and 102 Enforcement Priorities Guidelines) \nto ensure they are fit for purpose and reflect the new challenges brought about by modernisation and \ndigitalisation of the economy. ","564":"Having  that  said,  ICC  suggests  that  the  Commission,  before  committing  to  a  big  regulatory  reform, \nshould make a more efficient and effective use of the existing competition tools under Articles 101 and \n102 TFEU as well as the merger control regime that it has at its disposal, considering that both constitute \na  sufficient  way  to  resolve  main  competition  concerns  across  markets  (even  those  extended  to  the \ndigital era). ","565":"Moreover, the current, so called, \u201ctoolbox\u201d has much more potential than what it is recognised for by \nthe \u201cNCT IIA\u201d. Mainly through the application of the Regulation 1\/2003 which implements the rules on \ncompetition  laid  down  in  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU.  Article  8\/1  of  Regulation  1\/2003  provides  the \npossibility for the Commission, on its own initiative, to order provisional measures in \u201ccases of urgency \ndue to the risk of serious and irreparable damage to competition\u201d. Contrary to what the Commission \nproposes with the \u201cNCT\u201d, this provisional measure  dependent on the finding of an infringement: on one \nhand this fact supports the legitimacy to impose  interim measures, on the other  hand, it enables an \nintervention  before  a  \u201cserious  and  irreparable  damage  to  competition\u201d  occurs,  making  it  possible  to \ncounter competition problems even in this modernised digital market. Nonetheless, accounts show that \nthe Commission has rarely made use of this prospect. ","566":"Taking into consideration that there is not a detailed configuration of what the NCT would look like, it is \nindeed expected that any remedy to be imposed, regardless of the Option (between those provided in \nthe IIA), must be accompanied by a market investigation exactly to determine the structural competition \nproblem. In this regard, the information and disclosure requirements will have to be analogous to those \npredicted  in  Article  17  of  Regulation  1\/2003  for  the  sector  inquiries.  In  fact,  considering  that  this \ninstrument already exists, it raises the question if there is a need to create an uncertain (arbitrary) direct \ndisclosure power for the Commission, that is in its core intrusive and can lead to bigger problems like \nexposing trade secrets, with the added vicissitude that, by principle, in every Option presented by the \nCommission, there would be no need to find an indication of an infringement. This situation presents \nitself  as  very  disproportionate  and  unfair.  Therefore,  even  though  sector  inquiries  do  not  predict  the \nimposition of remedies, this instrument has shown to have an effect on market actors and allows the \nCommission  to  conduct  thorough  examinations  into  determined  sectors.  Clearly,  if  an  infringement \ndetrimental to competition is found, the Commission has the possibility either to impose structural or \nbehavioral remedies (Article 7) or to make a commitment binding (Article 9). Consequently, instead of \nsuggesting new \u201ctools\u201d, ICC believes that there should be a greater implementation (and enforcement) \nof the existing toolbox that proves to be sufficient. ","567":"Furthermore,  Article  7  of  the  Regulation  1\/2003  must  be  considered.  This  article  empowers  the \nCommission, by acting on a complaint or on its own initiative, to adopt behavioral or structural remedies \n\u201cwhich  are  proportionate  to  the  infringement  committed  and  necessary  to  bring  the  infringement \neffectively to an end\u201d.  It raises no questions that the core of the applicability of this article resides on \nthe  finding  of  an  infringement  committed  by  the  undertaking  -  an  abusive  behavior  regarding  its \ndominant position - and its purpose to cease an infringement of competition law. On the contrary, the \nundescribed remedies that emerge throughout the Options presented by the Commission according to \nthe NCT IIA are not limited. As already seen, there would not be (in any option) a requirement to put an \nend  to  an  identified  and  specific  infringement  of  competition  law.  The  consequences  of  not  limiting ","568":" \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fmaterially a remedy to the cessation of an identified competition infringement would be a far-reaching \nempowerment of the Commission, acting as a regulator, with the ability to reconstruct entire markets \nand unbundle enterprises. The inexistence of objectively delimited remedies would give a wide margin \nof discretion to the Commission which could imply the characterisation of determined business conducts \nand business models harmful to the competition that currently are seen as an expression of normal and \npertinent  performance  by  enterprises.  This  conclusion  leads  to  the  fact  that,  besides  the  already \npredictable effects of lack of investment, innovation and uncertainty that harms the consumers the most, \nit  is  against  the  established  principle  in  antitrust  law  that  internal  company  growth  should  not  be \nrestricted which, in any case, would be  possible with the enactment of this proposition,  by imposing \nremedies independent of abuse of dominance or even a dominant position. ","569":"Moreover,  besides  the  unestablished  evidence  showing  the  need  for  a  new  a  tool,  each  time  more, \npossible  competition  problems  are  in  the  course  of  being  addressed  via  recent  EU  legislation,  for \ninstance,  the  Regulation  2019\/1150  \u201con  promoting  fairness  and  transparency  for  business  users  of \nonline intermediation services\u201d and the ongoing review of the E-Commerce Directive. Adding to all this, \nan underlying theme in the IIA is the need for timely intervention that would supposedly be brought by \nthe NCT allowing  the Commission to impose remedies and \u201csolve problems\u201d in a much more (allegedly) \nrapid way. However, if we observe a similar instrument - the UK system of market investigation \u2013 it is \nrather obvious that quick results should not be expected, since most procedures inducted by CMA do \nnot offer the timely response the IIA is seeking.  ","570":"\u201cTipping\u201d Markets \nOne of the key points that the NCT IIA identifies as a structural competition problem, are certain markets \nthat are prone to \u201ctipping\u201d. The risks that \u201ctipping\u201d supposedly present emerge from the fact that certain \npowerful market participants (that exhibit a gatekeeper position) become so influential in that market \nthat they acquire the monopoly of profits and consumers and a position which is almost invulnerable to \ncompetition.  The  alleged  aim  of  the  NCT  is  exactly  to  prevent  these  situations,  by  intervening \nbeforehand, imposing structural and behavioral remedies. Criticism can be made regarding this aspect: \nfirstly, it is very rare any enforcement practice that relates with this subject, much rarer a case law from \nthe  ECJ.  This  is  a  matter  that  has  not  been  adequately  studied  and  analysed  to  legitimate  the \nCommission\u2019s  extensive  empowerment.  Therefore,  \u201ctipping\u201d  markets  as  one  of  the  frontal  structural \ncompetition problems that needs to be tackled, even consisting on the basis for the introduction of a \nnew legislation, seem very dubious, at least. ","571":"More importantly, \u201ctipping markets\u201d are not necessarily problematic. In fact, it has to be considered that \nthe idiosyncrasy of \u201ctipping\u201d is related to the increased value that users acquire from network effects. In \nmarkets  with  such  characteristics  preventing  \u201ctipping\u201d  would  be  nothing  but  a  pure  restriction  of \nperformance  competition,  preventing  the  internal  growth  of  businesses,  meaning  worse  results  for \nconsumers. This practice cannot be distinguished from successful integral growth as the outcome of \ncompetition  on  its  merits.  Therefore,  an  intervention  regarding  \u201ctipping  markets\u201d  is  realistically  not \nneeded, only being justified where an undertaking has critical market power and abuses it, but for those \ntypes of situations already fall under existing competition legislation.   ","572":"Leveraging into adjacent markets \nAnother  structural  competition  problem  indicated  by  the  NCT  IIA  is  the  fact  that  a  not  necessarily \ndominant company with market power may extend its market position to related markets. Again, this \nsituation does not constitute an inherent problem and may be, in fact, an essential part of the competitive ","573":" \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fprocess. If a company has transferable assets, skills and know-how\u2019s, utilising those for entering a new \narea  of  activity  is  indeed  a  contributing  factor  for  better  outcomes  regarding  the  users.  This  can  be \nconsidered a normal  activity regarding cost reduction  and increasing the  possibilities to successfully \nenter a new market. This situation could only be problematic, justifying an intervention and perhaps the \nimposition of a remedy or a commitment by the Commission after a detailed assessment concludes that \nthese practices were of an anti-competitive leveraging nature, situations that already fall into the existing \nregulatory  framework  (if  a  undertaking  is  dominant).  Only  in  these  cases  an  intervention  can  be \nconsidered proportionate and fair. ","574":"\u201cGatekeeper position\u201d \nOne  of  the  apparently  central  structural  competition  problems  that  the  Commission  aims  to  fix  are \n\u201cGatekeeper  scenarios\u201d.  This  question  must  be  evaluated  in  two  fronts:  firstly,  after  a  meticulous \nanalysis of The Special Advisors\u2019 report and the Inception Impact Assessment itself, there is an overall \nindication that the main focus of the Commission regarding this aspect are large online platforms (not \nnecessarily dominant but with extensive market power and at the same the Commission is separately \nproposing  to  introduce  targeted  ex  ante  regulation  of  digital  platforms  under  the  DSA  and  these \nmeasures  should  be  evaluated  before  further  intervention  in  the  form  of  the  NCT)  that  control  the \nplatform  ecosystem  being  \u201cthe  market  dynamics  only  determined  by  the  gatekeeper\u201d.  The  notions \nappointed by the Commission are particularly directed to the fact that these \u201cgatekeepers\u201d control the \nmarket  and  are  able  to  eliminate  competitors  due  to  its  monopolised  position.  Also,  as  some  of  the \nOptions described in the IIA predict, there is a predisposition from the Commission to departure from \nthe pre-conditions incorporated in the existing regulatory framework, more precisely Articles 101 and \n102, for the need to establish dominance, that would accelerate the procedures by not being limited to \nnormal sieves of determining the dominant position through a fairly archaic process.  ","575":"In this context, the real question is raised: Is what we have in our hands really a gap within the current \nEU legislation that exempts some \u201cgatekeepers\u201d from the competition law? Or does this question only \nemerge  due  to  the  fact  that  the  main  tool  for  assessing  dominance  must  updated  or  enforced?  Of \ncourse, that the control of considerable market shares conjugated with entry barriers and concentration \nare good indicators of market power, but if the problem is that its concentration of market shares does \nnot    reach  the  applicable  thresholds,  maybe  this  paradigm  should  be  changed,  not  basing  the \nestablishment of a dominant position on the assessment of market shares, but rather on more dynamic \nand modernised evidences. Therefore, if looked, for instance, to the definition of dominance in case-\nlaw Hoffman La Roche, that is more integrative, concerned with the actual strength presented by an \nundertaking  that  would  potentially  cease  relevant  competition  on  a  given  market  and  have  an \n\u201cappreciable  influence  on  the  conditions  under  which  that  competition  will  develop\u201d  the  gatekeeper \nposition  would  always  fall  under  this  standard,  and  therefore,  we  would  be  re-railed  to  normal  EU \ncompetition law procedures. Having that said, before a big legislative reform with such undetermined \nimpacts  in  the  real  economy  and  the  consumers,  ICC  recommends  that  there  should  be  a  further \nassessment on the question presented. ","576":"According to the \u201cNCT IIA\u201d the \u201c(\u2026) initiative is without prejudice to existing sector-specific regulation. \nIt  is  also  complementary  to  the  Commission\u2019s  new  initiative  on  platform-specific  ex  ante  regulation \n(\u2026)\u201d6. Nonetheless, taking in consideration the NCT IIA itself, it is very hard to conceive a complemental \nrelationship  with  clear  separation  of  competence.  In  fact,  the  New  Competition  Tool  seems  to \nconsiderably duplicate either the existing regulatory framework of the EU, as well as the proposed ex ","577":"This is one of the central questions that needs further analysis. In fact, as previously shown, a great \npart of the \u201cnew-era digital problems\u201d that the Commission entails to fix, seen as gaps that cannot be \nresolved (at least effectively) under the current regulatory framework are, indeed, still approachable by \nthis legislation, due to its flexibility and malleability that encompasses to novel problems. Having that \nsaid, there is no entail (according to NCT IIA) on how the Commission could be able to separate the \ncases without being discretionary (e.g. identifying which cases would still be under the Articles 101 and \n102 TFEU, and which cases would be under the new tool). Considering that digital markets expand \nevery  day,  creating  new  problems  and  conflicts  regarding  competition,  there  would  be  a  lot  of \nuncertainty on whether a given undertaking is subjected to a regulatory frame or the other, creating a \nsubstantial  burden  on  businesses,  potentiating  the  risk  of  inconsistent  arbitrary  outcomes  and, \nultimately,  disincentivising  investment.  These  situations  would  be  very  detrimental  for  consumers. \nTherefore,  the  importance  of  properly  defining  the  differentiated  scope  of  application  of  (eventual) \ndifferent  tools  should  be  stressed.  In  this  sense,  without  identifiable  boundaries  other  than  the \nCommission  could  intervene  when  there  is  a  (potential  unidentified)  structural  problem  that  poses  a \nthreat to competition that cannot be resolved \u201cin the most effective manner\u201d by Articles 101 and 102 \nTFEU,  the  New  Competition  Tool  can  only  be  recognised  as  a  (political)  shortcut  concerning  the \nestablished competition enforcement legislative process, which threatens its legitimacy. ","578":"As previously stated, the existing regulatory framework also includes the EU Merger Regulation (ECMR) \nthat deals with preventive market structure control (if said mergers lead to an impediment of effective \ncompetition). In this sense, behavioral and structural remedies that might be applied by the Commission \n(unbundling  especially),  are  prone  to  conflict  with  the  principal  of  allocation  of  competences.  This  is \nanother example of the redundancy of the \u201cNCT\u201d and the way it deteriorates legal safety and certainty. ","579":"Overlapping of the Commission proposed ex ante regulatory tool \nThe New Competition Tool although seemingly complementary, as explained by the NCT IIA, even with \nthe Commission\u2019s new initiative (ex ante regulatory tool), does not seem to have its own place. A deeper \nanalysis reveals that both tools can be treated as a regulatory instruments that would target large online \nplatforms  (positions  of  dominance  or  \u201cmarket  power\u201d)  acting  as  gatekeepers,  which  benefit  from \nidentified structural competition problems (network and scale effects) that need to be tackled. In this \nsense, their scope partially replicates, becoming redundant.  ","580":"Contributing to this situation of inconsistency and added burden for enterprises, is the fact that, even \nthough  the  scope  of  this  initiatives  is  not  defined,  there  is  already  the  decision  that  they  will  be  (if \nenacted)  administered  by  distinct  Directorates  (CNECT  and  COMP)  creating  an  increased  risk  of \ndiminished clarity on who relies the competence in a given case, again, potentiating uncertainty. ","581":"Overlapping Member States (expected) national legislative initiatives \nConcerning the enforcement of competition rules in the EU, the Commission gave up its monopoly, by \ndecentralising  EU  competition  law  enforcement  to  member  states  and  their  national  authorities  via \nRegulation 1\/2003. Having that said, several EU members have already initiated legislative adaptations \nof Article 102 TFEU making its scope broader concerning unilateral conducts, therefore, falling outside \nthe division of competence initially predicted with Regulation 1\/2003. This is an added concern, whether \nbecause it makes national legislation redundant or, even worst, it may be contradictory to these national ","582":"As stated above (point 2), in all the options given by the Commission to be considered, there is not a \nneed  for  the  Commission  to  find  an  infringement  of  the  law  to  be  able  to  impose  a  wide  range  of \nbehavioral  and  structural  remedies.  In  options  (3)  and  (4),  inclusive,  there  would  not  have  to  be \nestablished abuse or even a dominant position (under Article 102 TFEU) in order for those sanctions, \nas long as they have \u201cmarket power\u201d. ","583":"Assessing  the  data  provided  by  the  NCT  IIA,  there  is  a  manifest  insufficiency  of  a  description  that \njustifies such a panoply of regulatory arbitrary discretion by the Commission. In contrast, the proposals \nlack a very much needed detailed consideration of a system of checks and balances in these cases, in \na way to mitigate the apparent discretionary powers that are being given to the Commission. There is \nnot a defined legislative instrument, it is the Commission itself defining (eventually) what is considered \na structural problem and also imposing the appropriate remedies. Contrasting with the normal sieves \nof the application of Articles 101 and 102, it is evident the absence of a sense of proportionality, much  \nmore evident when we realise that contrary to the existing legal framework, there is not a need to find \nan  infringement.  An  \u201cearly  intervention\u201d  whenever  the  Commission  concludes  there  is  a  \u201cthreat  to \ncompetition\u201d does not suffice. Even though the NCT IIA indicates that the Commission will be \u201ctaking \ninto account the rights of defense and the right to judicial review\u201d, a system of checks and balances \nneeds to be a lot more densified, assuring that interventions are only prosecuted when proportionate, \nnecessary, substantiated in hard evidence and, therefore, capable of addressing any perceived issues, \nwhich does not seem to be the case. ","584":"Still regarding this aspect,  the NCT IIA refers that even though the Commission is being enabled to \nimpose behavioral and structural remedies, it wouldn\u2019t impose fines \u201cand thus not generate  rights to \nlaunch damage claims\u201d. This is a paradoxical situation, because it gives the impression that by the fact \nthat the Commission does not impose fines it is being \u201chelpful\u201d towards the undertakings. Nonetheless, \nwe must take in consideration that by mandating structural remedies that could imply the unbundling of \nundertakings and restructuration\u2019s of business models and industries, these impositions are far more \nprejudicial to enterprises than paying fines. The Commission would be empowered to impose significant \nmarket changes in the European Union. There could also be the expectation that the \u201cNCT\u201d would claw \noff some burdens, more precisely the burden of proof.  ","585":"Finally, concerning this aspect,  it should  not be forgotten that  the proposed \u201cNCT\u201d has  the ability to \npropose  stricter  remedies,  even  without  having  to  find  any  infringement  or  the  indication  of  one. \nComparing  two  potential  situations  we  could  have  scenarios  where  an  undertaking  after  the \nCommission  finds  an  infringement  that  falls  into  the  existing  regulatory  framework  may  adopt  a \ncommitment in the terms of Article 9 of Regulation 1\/2003, while an undertaking without a dominant \nposition and without committing any wrongdoing could be subjected to impositions regarding structural \nor behavioral remedies. This means that companies might face stricter remedies, with less procedural \nrights without committing any infringement. Besides being outrageously disproportionate, this type of \nsituation does not seem to meet the standards of Fundamental and Constitutional rights. ","586":" \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIt is imperative that one realises that the introduction of a NCT, as described by the Inception Impact \nAssessment, would surely create legal uncertainty and incoherencies, constricting the innovation and \ndynamism  potential  for  companies  that  would  be  limited  or  even  punished  for  being  successful  and \noutdoing  their  competitors  even  trough  fair  competition,  solely  because  they  could  became  \u201cmarket \ndominant\u201d.  Ultimately,  this  situation  would  turn  into  a  vicious  cycle  leading  to  disincentive  to  invest, \ntherefore  leading  to  less  innovation  and  competition,  with  the  spill-over  effects  to  smaller  and  new-\ncoming enterprises, resulting in far worst conditions for consumers. ","587":"Throughout  the  presentation  of  the  previous  points  one  was  already  able  to  showcase  some \ncircumstances concerning the introduction of this \u201cNew Competition Tool\u201d and its relationship with some \nfundamental protected rights. In this regard, we can talk about an inherent risk of deviation from legal \nstandards entrenched in European Law and the European Court of Justice. \nFirstly, as already referred to, the extensive empowerment of the Commission to impose structural and \nbehavioral remedies, particularly without the need to establish an infringement, is a disproportionate \nmeasure that interferes with the free market economy and private property. This, combined with a lack \nof details concerning the \u201cwhen\u2019s and how\u2019s\u201d of its intervention, results in a discretionary and uncertain \nprocedure. It is a departure from the evidence-based approach to competition law that  is applicable \ntoday, which is subject to clear standards and judicial review.  ","588":"Therefore, in this regard, it must be also stressed the insufficiency of guidelines that indicates (a much \nneeded)  rigorous  procedural  safeguard(s),  ensuring  that  the  concerns  brought  by  the  Commission \n(even  without  an  indication  of  an  infringement)  are  thoroughly  and  methodically  investigated  when \ndetermining a remedy. On the other hand, the interests of stakeholders must be accounted for. They \nshould have rights to defense and independent judicial reviews, which requires a case-by-case analysis, \nensuring high-quality decision making (like nowadays). In this sense, the Commission should be careful \nconcerning the violation of Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights that predicts a \u201cright to \nan effective remedy and to a fair trial\u201d. Also, the Commission should very attentive in regard to Article \n48 CFR, especially when imposing a remedy without finding any infringement. There seems to be an \nincoherency  between  this  type  situation  and  the  presumption  of  innocence  of  the  enterprises  as \nprovided in the European Convention of Human Rights, that is yet to be justified. ","589":"More particularly, if one analyses the unbundling procedures, they will come to the conclusion that these \nprocesses  eliminate  productivity  and  capability  of  prosperous  enterprises  and  diminishes  the \nwillingness to invest. In current times, there is yet to appear convincing evidences that these adverse \ncircumstances are counterbalanced by consequential improvement in competitive conditions. Like the \nsimilar cases where this used to happen in the US, there  is  a tendency to abandon the  intention  of \nsplitting companies regardless of their conduct as a measure to eradicate market power. Besides the \neconomic  impacts,  it  is  very  important  to  highlight  that  if  such  powers  are  given  to  the  Commission \n(unbundling without a previous justified reason) we can be standing on, as indicated by the ECJ, an \ninfringement  of  the  fundamental  right  of  freedom  of  property  recognised  under  Article  6\/3  TEU  and \nArticle 17 CFR, where the sole establishment of a competence for property intervention is considered \nan interposition in fundamental rights. Concerning this aspect, it should be pointed out that an imposed \ntransfer  of  assets,  specifically  by  unbundling  would  constitute  an  expropriation  that  requires,  for \nproportionality and fairness reasons, a damage (compensation) claim, something the Commission is \nnot intending on doing as demonstrated by the NCT IIA. ","590":" \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAs stated above, this wide and discretionary empowerment of the Commission is prone to conflict to \nthe \u201cright to do business\u201d under Art. 16 CFR. In fact, through its mission of regulating and impeding a \ndistortion of competition by enforcing behavioral and structural measures without the need to find an \ninfringement  and  without  any  coherent  formalisation  of  the  set  of  circumstances  that  fall  within  its \npowers, it has opened the susceptibility for the Commission to (politically) intervene, changing business \nmodels and proceeding to restructure markets. We would be able to see a lot of ordinary situations in \nthe traditional model become subject to interventions of the Commission, being virtually impossible to \ndifferentiate  the  good  and  the  bad  practices  in  the  Commission\u2019s  view,  implying  directly  with  this \nfundamental right that would stunt companies\u2019 growth and innovation, alongside other economical stand \npoints. ","591":"First  and  foremost,  we  must  acknowledge  that  the  ECJ  have  been  consistently  considering  that  the \nappropriate legal basis is a matter of constitutional implication. In fact, it ensures conformity with the \nprinciple instituted in Article 5 TEU and limits the scope of the EU competence. Nevertheless, neither \nof these articles seems to be an adequate legal basis: the scope of Article 103 TFEU is to enable the \nadoption of legislation to \u201cgive effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102\u201d  \u2013 its aim is to \nprovide the application of these provisions, but not to alter or complement them. In contrast, the NCT \nseeks to create a new instrument to be applied where an infringement has not even occurred or where \na dominant position does not exist, which makes it very dubious if any of the Options presented by the \nCommission seeking to remedy the identified structural problems could be based on Article 103 TFEU. \nOn the other hand, when it comes to Article 14 TFEU two conditions have to be considered:  on one \nside, the fact that a lot of Member States are in a legislative process to produce new competition laws \naiming at an adaptation to a digitalised economy, On the other side because the scope of Article 114 \nTFEU, regarding it being an appropriate legal basis for approximation measures, is settled on the fact \nthat it removes or prevents distortions of competition by developing conditions of the functioning of the \ninternal market. Now, if one looks at the aim of the NCT IIA, it is not based on eliminating distortions of \ncompetition, but rather eliminating structural risks that cannot (allegedly) at least efficiently be tackled \nby the existing regulatory framework for competition law.

However, we are still dependent on some types of online platforms \u2013 e.g. on app stores for distribution, on operating systems, on web browsers etc.Please find our comments with regard to some of the answers.","593":"B - Ecosystems created by platforms can generally be beneficial for users. As far as we are concerned, it is more important to evaluate market shares of platforms, whether they have competitors in the market, whether users are able to switch or multi-home, whether a platform implements exclusive practices etc.","594":"I \u2013 The importance of this factor may depend on a rarity of particular assets and can vary for different markets. With the development of the digital economy, it is generally becoming easier for digital services to collect necessary data independently of other market participants.

For example, major app stores (such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Google Play), being gatekeepers in their markets, prohibit developers to use their own payment processing systems in applications and create other obstacles for rival developers (such as reduced data collection capabilities). As another example, Google does not develop fully functional applications for competing mobile operating systems and restricts use of its APIs in order to decrease the popularity of those operating systems (e.g., YouTube app and most of other Google\u2019s services on Windows Mobile devices).","596":"Although financial strength is generally a positive factor, it may sometimes raise significant competition concerns.

Commitment decisions are frequently used by the Commission in order to address structural problems. As manifested in Gazprom case (AT.39816) the adoption of commitment decision does not mean that structural problems stemming from a long-term anticompetitive strategy are really addressed. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of some commitment decisions, it should be emphasised that art. 102 requires the Commission to identify and prove an infringement of EU competition law. It allows the Commission to investigate and punish certain practices like unfair pricing or market segmentation while striking a proper balance in burden of proof and safeguarding the rights of defence. In relation to non-digital sectors art. 102 TFEU constitutes an effective, transparent and well-established solution capable of addressing, alongside with sector specific regulation, structural problems existing in these markets.

Imposing structural remedies should be a last-resort solution. If other less intrusive measures might lead to the same results, the Commission should abstain from using structural remedies.

Platforms may also track user activity on third-party websites and applications. This is further exacerbated when platforms control whole ecosystems. Based on this data, platforms are able to target their offerings to users, after having profiled them accordingly.  They can also offer targeted content based on a user\u2019s preferences. For example, according to Facebook\u2019s commercial terms, Facebook is able to gather information such as clicks, likes, website visits, product views, product purchases, app usages about their users from (i) Facebook\u2019s own ecosystem, be it on Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp, (ii) through the infrastructure of a client of Facebook\u2019s advertising services, and (iii) from outside their own ecosystem (collected via Pixels which are installed on websites\/e-commerce shops of third parties). As such, Facebook keeps very detailed profiles and generates even more users\u2019 attention. Dependency on this wealth of data is thus crucial for any market operator to compete. Such platforms can take advantage of the data they collect from their business partners\u2019 websites to expand in new markets after having studied carefully successful business models in these markets. These platform\u2019s commercial strategies are based on a significant information asymmetry between the platforms and users\/market players. \n(P) Another unique characteristic which contributes to structural competition issues in digital markets\u2019 operation is that users pay for the services they use with their attention. The time that consumers spend in the ecosystems of large online platforms (Total Consumer Time or \u201cTCT\u201d) is a significant indicator that a provider captures significant user attention. The higher the TCT, the greater the ability and incentive of a platform to monetise this attention by nudging it towards its own offerings or specific third-party offers. This situation entrenches market power and softens competition, given the strong network effects noticed in digital markets, which means that successful business operation does not depend on price, better quality or more innovative solutions, but rather on the number of users who are already customers of a platform. \nPlease see reply to question 6 above and 18.4 belowPlease refer to Q8.2 above.The competitive effects of leveraging strategies are ambiguous and complex. While firms with market power on the one hand often leverage in order to provide consumers with better products and\/or lower prices, entry by large (digital) platforms into lines of business adjacent to their core offerings often forecloses competitors and thereby eliminates competition. Once platforms have placed themselves in a gatekeeper position, they lock-in users on both sides of the platform. \nFor example, leveraging can occur in the form of (hard or soft) bundling.  Platforms leverage their existing market power by requiring or encouraging the sale of their products in adjacent market(s) with their existing services in their core market. Such bundling can have anti-competitive or pro-competitive effects. \nA specific form of bundling in platform markets is \u2018envelopment\u2019 when a platform with market power enters a new market pioneered by a rival platform and forecloses it, by nudging its user base towards its own new offering.  \nLeveraging could also take the form of unjustified self-preferencing. Self-preferencing occurs when a platform gives preferential treatment to its own products or services when they are in competition with products and services provided by other entities. Again, competitive effects are ambiguous. Giving its products or services preferential treatment could be justified and seen as an appropriate reward for management of the platform, or where there is a valid business rationale underlying a combined offering of related services (with a benefit for the consumer), making the development of innovative platforms in future more likely. However, competition \u2018downstream\u2019 can be severely distorted or eliminated in case of unjustified self-preferencing.\nIn summary, leveraging can take many different forms. Any assessment of leveraging must consider the effects (expected or actual) of the conduct early enough to avoid tipping.\nTwo prominent examples of particularly problematic behaviour by gatekeeper platforms with market power, where intervention is needed, are:","636":"(i) Directly or indirectly impede competitors from either competing in, expanding or entering a market in which the respective large platform can rapidly expand, even without being dominant.\n(ii) Create or raise barriers to market entry or impede the expansion of other undertakings, by using data crucial for competition among existing players in one market, which has been obtained from another side\/adjacent\/vertical or otherwise related market, where the platform has market power, in combination with other data relevant for competition from sources beyond the dominated market, or demand terms and conditions that permit such use.","637":"The current proposal to update the competition law in Germany provides a good example for regulation that can address such practices (proposed \u00a719a GWB). This provision would essentially authorise the Federal Cartel Office to intervene against certain, explicitly delicate and therefore specified behaviours of an undertaking with paramount significance for competition across markets (UPSCAM). On the basis of a two-stage system, the FCO could first determine in accordance that an undertaking is an UPSCAM in order to then prohibit adopting abusive practices that harm competition.Articles 101 and 102 TFEU as they are designed currently, are insufficient to fully capture the negative ramifications of gatekeepers\u2019 conduct.\nCompetition law by its nature would intervene to end potentially unlawful practices if, overall, they had a net negative impact on \u2018consumer welfare\u2019 and led to e.g. increased price or lower quality products. However, actions by platforms with a gatekeeper role may have a negative impact that is only partially captured by economic and competition law analysis. \nEven if a competition authority intervenes, it would need to establish that the gatekeeper has a dominant position in order to investigate its potentially abusive unilateral conduct. Assuming it could establish that a gatekeeper has this level of market power, competition law analysis would nevertheless not capture intangible harms, such as harms to fundamental rights, access to information, etc. Recent enforcement examples have also shown that it takes a significant amount of time and resources before an infringement of competition law rules is established. However, the risk with digital markets is that they move too fast to be supervised ex post, when the conditions of competition and market positions might have changed. \nFinally, the approach through competition law raises issues of legal certainty; enforcers have to apply new concepts, which lead to litigation challenges and therefore become legally established only years and potentially more than a decade after the relevant conduct.  \nAccording to the Special Advisers\u2019 Report commissioned by the EC, the concern around digital markets relates to antitrust under-enforcement, since the harm to competition is expected to be longer term than in traditional markets because of the stickiness of market power (See Cr\u00e9mer, de Montjoye, and Schweitzer, 42; and Stigler Committee, 74). \nMaximising TCT and building gatekeeper power is intrinsically linked to the business model of a number of large global players. Significant network effects reinforce this. Accordingly, the leitmotif of competition law (disaggregated pluralistic offerings by independent players) does not adequately capture this key part of the economy. Because certain offerings will almost naturally lead to power over consumer attention, the use of this power must be regulated, in particular because breaking up these companies will often not be realistic: most are based abroad and unbundling may well lead to poorer service quality in some cases.As described in response to Q8.2 above, in particular large online platforms that act as gatekeepers have significant market power in their core markets, in particular with regard to online advertising market. They expand this market power into other sectors where specialist companies offer their products and services such as into the travel sector, the e-commerce sector etc. At the same time, gatekeeper positions can be compared to classical monopolisations strategies. There is a structural imbalance between the business model of online platforms and of specialist online companies. The latter offer certain products or services to online users in return for money. Online platforms position themselves at an earlier stage. They attract the attention of users through a variety of offers, which are actually not the products they sell (e.g. social network, search engine, maps, etc.), and direct this attention to third parties (where users can buy goods or services) or to their own integrated specialist offers. The more time users spend in such an ecosystem the more is the ecosystem enabled to control this attention. This impedes competition for services. It replaces competition on the merit between different offerings by protected \u201cwalled gardens\u201d to be exploited by those who develop them.Please refer to Q10.2 above.Please refer to Q10.2 above.Please refer to Q8.7 above.Please refer to Q9.1 above.Please refer to Q9.3 above.","638":"Examples of tipping markets encountered include: the provision of online (display) advertising\/marketing (search) services, supply of analytics and digital tools (ad tech services), online shopping\/e-commerce solutions, social networking and messaging services, as well as intermediation services (with demand or search for content). In these markets, strong network effects are easily observable (e.g. social networks where the attractiveness of the platform grows with the number of users). \nZalando notes that the online advertising sector is currently dominated by only two large platforms (i.e. Google (see recent Google\/Fitbit findings), Facebook). Their strong market position is fuelled by their ability to capture the attention of consumers. This can be achieved through a platform\u2019s ecosystem of, inter alia, social media and messaging services or of a search engine in combination with video streaming.\nBecause of the strong network effects, which are further entrenched by the accumulation of large amounts of data on consumers\u2019 preferences and behaviour, these markets have tipped in favour of monopoly (or at least oligopoly). \nAt the same time, Facebook is building their own direct relationship with fashion customers and brands via their Facebook Marketplace, Instagram Shopping or Facebook Shops. Facebook has been increasing their e-commerce activities through several steps on Instagram. For example, in 2018 Instagram extended its shopping functions into \u201cStories\u201d and the \u201cExplore Tab\u201d, including the option for the user to create a wish list of buyable content. From 2019, through \u201cShopping Tags\u201d, Instagram users can directly shop \u201clooks\u201d (i.e. fashion items they see on content posted by other users\/influencers) on the spot.\nWithin this context, consumers are to certain extent incentivised not to use competing to the incumbents\u2019 services (either due to exclusivity obligations or because of the imposed incumbency advantage). Effectively, these companies act as gatekeepers who harvest the attention of consumers, while they then sell access to the time consumers spend online. \nThe time users spent in their ecosystems has always been a key performance indicator for gatekeeper-platforms as it measures their success in capturing the attention of the user - and as it allows them to direct the users\u2019 attention in any direction that helps grow their business. Therefore, this indicator is particularly suited to show market power early on as a leading indicator and in complementation to traditional indicators.Network effects arise when the value of the one side of the market for each user grows with the number of other people using the other side of the market. With (indirect) network effects an undertaking\u2019s sales of a given product or service to a certain group of agents has an effect on the value of a different product or service purchased by a different group of agents. As such, network effects can induce smaller mark-ups. Equally, network effects can shield an undertaking from competition and become a significant source of market power, given new entrants\u2019 (or existing smaller players\u2019) inability to meet the prices of the undertaking with market power. The presence of strong network effects then easily leads to the market tipping in favour of the largest market operator.\nNetwork effects often arise due to demand-driven economies of scale, i.e. learning by doing\/machine learning. For example, users of search engines typically do not care directly about the engine\u2019s market share, while the quality of search results is deeply connected to the scale of a search engine\u2019s operations.\nUnilateral behaviour such as a targeted obstruction of multi-homing or switching, which leads to a \u201ccompetitive bottleneck\u201d significantly contribute to tipping. For example, in a scenario with two or more competing marketplaces where buyers single-home, the given marketplace becomes the only means through which sellers can access buyers. Thus, not only can marketplaces insist on sellers paying the monopoly price for accessing their exclusive turf of buyers, but competition on the seller side is shut down. Single homing can be entrenched by exclusive dealing arrangements. \nAnother crucial element ranked as \u201cImportant\u201d which can enhance tipping effects is the economies of scale in collecting and processing data on user preferences and behaviour. Digital platforms can collect these data through usage of their services by, inter alia, calibrating algorithms and profiling potential customers. The gathering and processing of a significant amount of data is another incumbency advantage. As such, an undertaking can obtain significant market power because of data accumulation which can render it an unavoidable trading partner for certain services. \nAs \u201csomewhat important\u201d for tipping, Zalando also views the substitutability or complementarity between different datasets gathered for the different services offered by incumbents, integration of products, services and hardware, behavioural limitations on the part of consumers (e.g. lack of favourable expectations, that an entrant might conquer the market if enough consumers migrate), difficulty in raising capital, the importance of brands, and the role as information brokers.\nTipping is neither new nor solely noticed in digital markets (see for example, standards tipping towards a preferred one (e.g. VHS, DVD, USB-C), financial infrastructure markets), but rather common in markets with significant network effects.\nHowever, modern digital markets are unique, not only because of their strong network effects, but also because competition for the market cannot be counted on to address market tipping issues. While in the past, some dominant technology companies seemed unassailable, but then encountered competition due to technological changes that created new markets and new companies, today network effects and returns to scale of data are more entrenched and these markets have become more stable. Assuming further that the next technological revolution takes place in the near future (e.g. artificial intelligence, machine learning), the entities most likely to benefit from it will likely be the existing large incumbents, due to the necessary data accumulated for the successful use of these tools.\nAs noted in question 16.2, Zalando has encountered market tipping in the following digital markets: provision of online (display) advertising\/marketing (search) services, supply of analytics and digital tools (ad tech services), online shopping\/e-commerce solutions, social networking and messaging services, and intermediation services (with demand or search for content). To varying degrees, tipping has also taken place in other digital industries, such as online flight booking services, streaming services, digital maps, online review\/rating services, online ride-hailing, internet browsers, smartphone operating systems, where large data platforms have entered, playing out their unique advantage based on consumer data.\nAs mentioned, digital platforms are also characterized by \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. For instance, the value of joining a social media outlet or a communication service is clearly increasing with the number of other users a consumer can interact with. In other markets, this link is subtler.In digital markets, \u201ctipping\u201d is often not the inevitable \u201cnatural\u201d outcome of competition on the merits but can be effectively promoted and enhanced by certain practices of individual players with market power. \nThus, disadvantaged entrants are disincentivised to continue engaging in competition, leading to an overall ine?ciently low rate of innovation. Furthermore, if data collected in the primary market is also useful in lowering marginal costs in another, neighbouring or connected market, then incumbents will have a tendency to expand creating big conglomerates, thereby creating more room for unjustified self-preferencing.\nMoreover, in markets with strong network effects, such as digital ones, the willingness of users, who are away from the marginal point, to pay increases with quantity. Thus, if a ?rm were to engage in price discrimination, this could potentially allow for higher mark-ups than in markets lacking network effects. Consumers might face higher prices as a result. \nAs also mentioned, because of the competitive bottleneck outcome present in a number of digital platform markets, competition on the seller side might be effectively shut down. However, this situation creates dynamic ine?ciencies due to the incumbency advantage.\nTiming is crucial when considering intervention in a market that may tip. This is because the processes during the \u2018tipping\u2019 phase are in some sense \u2018natural\u2019. As such, if a supplier\u2019s action is responsible for setting the conditions for tipping, it is most likely that this action will take place before the market in question becomes monopolised, possibly even before it becomes obvious that it is heading that way. However, once the market is in the course of tipping to monopoly, it may be too late to intervene, while the effects can hardly be reversed. Regulatory intervention to prevent tipping may need to occur long before a supplier is dominant, or before doing anything apparently abusive.\nConsequently, regulatory intervention against unilateral behaviour that is not justified on grounds of competition on the merits and which is found to have a serious probability to promote \u201ctipping\u201d might need to occur already below the dominance threshold. Regulators should be able to prohibit platform providers in close oligopolies, or platform providers with significant market power, to obstruct competition, insofar as the behaviour in question is found to have a serious probability to promote \u201ctipping\u201d. Prohibition of practices obstructing multi-homing or switching should be also included in the authority\u2019s toolbox.\nAs mentioned in question 17.1, unilateral behaviour prone to promote tipping might take place before the market is monopolised or before a market player has reached a level of market power which would trigger article 102 TFEU. Currently, a similar behaviour can only be addressed if the respective actor has a degree of market power relevant under competition law (i.e. a dominant position under Article 102 TFEU).\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, strong network effects lead to lower mark-ups or even zero or negative pricing in multi-sided digital markets. However, below cost, or even zero prices can be a manifestation of the exercise of market power. The traditional framework for the assessment of anticompetitive pricing is inadequate to address similar issues of zero\/negative pricing in multi-sided platforms, where cost is not crucial. \nMoreover, platforms use certain tools that affect users\u2019 choices to compete, which do not necessarily fall within an established category of \u201cabusive\u201d practices under article 102 TFEU. \nIn instances where a business partner of a platform may have suffered from what could be perceived as discrimination (e.g., for instance as a result of a change in an algorithm) might have been able to resolve the issue without the intervention of a competition authority. This is not currently provided as an option under article 101 TFEU. \nFinally, one of the downsides with competition cases pursued under articles 101 and 102 TFEU is that they take a long time to resolve and remedies may come at a time where the market has already tipped in favour of a company and negative effects on competition are irreversible (e.g. market exit).\nThe above do not suggest that articles 101 and 102 TFEU are completely inappropriate to address tipping, but rather that their enforcement might be lacking in efficiency. For example, wider use of interim measures, or specialised supplementary rules which would lower the threshold for intervention, would be some of the options.In digital markets, online platforms may obtain gatekeeper power by permitting or restricting access to, inter alia, information, content, websites, purchasable offers, buyers, consumers, agents, advertisements and users\u2019 attention (eyeballs), much like in the offline world, an owner can permit or restrict access to their property. Digital gatekeepers are in position to exercise this power mainly because of their ability to control, direct, channel and influence TCT (see above, namely the where, why and how consumers spend their time in the online world). \nThis gatekeeper power is further entrenched as only certain large online platforms control the technology on which other businesses rely in order to effectively conduct their business in the online economy. Producers, retailers and advertisers who are looking to reach potential customers heavily rely on these platforms. As such, these market players have become vital intermediaries and, in many occasions, the only real option. Alternate channels to reach consumers can only supplement access on the margins, as the large incumbent platforms generate too much business and attract so many consumers\u2019 eyeballs which makes it entirely impossible to completely bypass them. This renders businesses highly dependent on the platforms for access to users, which reinforces the platforms\u2019 gatekeeper role.","639":"\nOther relevant and \"very important\" feature that qualifies a platform as a gatekeeper: Total Consumer Time (TCT)\nThe time users spent in their ecosystems has always been a key performance indicator for gatekeeper-platforms as it measures their success in capturing the attention of the user - and as it allows them to direct the users\u2019 attention in any direction that helps grow their business. Therefore, this indicator is particularly suited to show market power early on as a leading indicator and in complementation to traditional indicators.\nAn appropriate name and description of the indicator is Total Consumer Time (TCT). It is defined as follows:\nTotal Consumer Time (TCT): The time all active consumers together spend on a platform or in an ecosystem (e.g. measured in hours per day\/month\/year). Should be measured as an average.\nConsumer time market (benchmark): To clearly identify the (dominant) position of a certain platform in comparison to other platforms, the TCT of a company needs to be seen in relation to the whole consumer time spent. \nExample: In 2018, UK internet users spent an average of 195 minutes each day online (100% benchmark). Users spent on average nearly 41 minutes of that time on Google websites, Apps, etc. (Total Consumer Time Google). Expressed in relative terms this means 21% TCT.

However, digital markets require different powers and methods adjusted to their own fast changing dynamics and the increased need to process data on a constant basis. The deep impact on markets and society give rise to a compelling public interest to enforce these rules rigorously and timely. \nIf the Commission intervenes within the traditional article 102 TFEU enforcement framework, it would need to establish that the gatekeeper has the requisite market power in order to investigate its potentially abusive unilateral conduct. Assuming it could establish that a gatekeeper has this level of market power, competition law analysis would nevertheless not capture intangible harms, such as harms to fundamental rights. On the other hand, recent enforcement examples have shown that it takes significant amount of time and resources before a solid infringement of competition law rules is established. However, the risk with digital markets and gatekeepers is that they move too fast to be supervised ex post, when the conditions of competition and market positions might have changed and harm to competition and consumers\u2019 choice may be irreversible.\nAccording to the Special Advisers\u2019 Report commissioned by the EC, the concern around digital markets relates to antitrust under-enforcement, since the harm to competition is expected to be longer term than in traditional markets because of the stickiness of market power (See Cr\u00e9mer, de Montjoye, and Schweitzer, 42; and Stigler Committee, 74).Competition law, and articles 101 and 102 TFEU in particular, may not be entirely well-placed to capture the negative ramifications of gatekeepers\u2019 conduct, or enforcement actions may be set in motion only when it is too late to intervene. Competition law by its nature would intervene to end potentially unlawful practices if, overall, they had a net negative impact on \u2018consumer welfare\u2019 and led to e.g. increased price or lower quality products. However, actions by platforms with a gatekeeper role may have negative impact that is not necessarily captured by economic and competition law analysis (e.g. negative societal impact and human rights implications). \nSee also Q19.1 above.-","640":"Remedies must primarily take into effect the structural imbalance between ecosystems that act as gatekeepers and specialist offers. Remedies prevent or prohibit gatekeepers from discriminating third party offers or preference their own specialist offers in comparison to specialist offers that are not vertically integrated and whose business model does not focus on establishing ecosystems. \nThere are similarities to traditional concepts of measuring and dealing with market power as established under Art. 102 TFEU. On the other hand, digital markets are more dynamic and fast changing than traditional markets and the roles of the actors can change quickly. Further, the importance of factors such TCT or data collection must be weighed in. \nAn assessment of gatekeepers can be based on the following concept: \n- In a first step, the gatekeeper must be identified. TCT is particularly suited to assess a gatekeeper position (potentially in combination with other criteria, such as market share in online advertising, entry barriers, lock-in and network effects, access to datapoints of internet users and financial strength).\n- The new regulatory authority could have the power to explicitly declare that a company is a gatekeeper. The company could challenge such a finding in court.\n- Certain rules could then apply to a declared gatekeeper during the time it is declared a gatekeeper. \n- The authority should have the resources and powers to constantly monitor the market behaviour of the gatekeeper (to also be able to react to changes if the gatekeeper position is lost). \n- The declaration could result in legal certainty also for the gatekeeper (as in opposite to self-assessment concepts). \nThe rules that apply to gatekeepers should effectively prevent foreclosure effects by prohibiting in particular discrimination etc. Other rules could accompany these prohibitions (such as obligations regarding interoperability, transparency rules regarding data collection etc.).\nPlease also refer to Q31.1 below.Potential obligations, depending on the case, may include:\n- Platform neutrality: rules should require a platform to treat all commerce (information and data) flowing through it equally, non-discriminatorily, and fairly, thereby preventing a platform from using the threat of discrimination to extract and extort in order to protect innovation and equal access to all of the information and services available.\n- Code of Conduct: establishing a code of Conduct (similar to the UK Digital Competition Expert Panel\u2019s) built around a set of core principles which will aim to ensure that business users are: (i) provided with access to designated platforms on a fair, consistent and transparent basis; (ii) are provided with prominence, rankings and reviews on designated platforms on a fair, consistent, and transparent basis; and (iii) are not unfairly restricted from utilizing alternative platforms or routes to market.\n- Ringfencing: potentially requiring platforms to keep their advertising networks separated by the introduction of at least Chinese Wall obligations.\nPlease also refer to Q30.1 above.","641":"The dedicated rules with regard to gatekeepers could be integrated as additional provisions into the existing and traditional set of competition law concepts. The danger of foreclosure effects sits well into what has already been established with regard to prohibitions and obligation in relation to dominant companies within the meaning of Art. 102 TFEU. \nHowever, the digital markets require different powers and methods to their own fast changing dynamics and the increased need to process data on a constant basis. Private enforcement through courts alone would not be effective, as gatekeeper practices require investigation and assessment of results. The deep impact on markets and the society give raise to a compelling public interest to enforce these rules through a dedicated authority.\nThis authority should be placed at EU level and not at national level as the platforms that have the potential to act as gatekeepers usually cover at least the entire EU or EEA. A centralised approach for the common market will create a stronger incentive to comply, which would not be the case for smaller Member States who would adopt their own regulations. It would also avoid \u201ccompetition to the bottom\u201d between Member States to attract large platforms. \nThe EU\u2019s institutions have proven to have sufficient reputation and weight to enforce EU rules on a global basis. \nThe dedicated regulatory authority should be the European Commission. The Commission could either rely on a unit within DG Competition or within DG Connect. Another possibility would be an agency, but we believe that this might be less effective to ensure consistency between the enforcement of the new tool and existing competition laws.\nAny enforcer must have the necessary resources and powers to be able to deal with the specific characteristics of digital markets.Please also refer to Q33.1 above.Digital markets are more dynamic and fast changing than traditional markets and the roles of the actors can change quickly. Time-limits for investigating these markets can therefore be important for two of reasons. First, a clear time limit ensures the possibility of early intervention. Second, it contributes to efficiency: given the substantial cost and frustration associated with lengthy investigations, time limits guard against unnecessary costs and will help to ensure that investigations into digital markets are focussed and efficient from the start.Digital markets are more dynamic and fast changing than traditional markets and the roles of the actors can change quickly. To be able to react quickly and efficiently, interim measures can be important to ensure the effectiveness of the counter-measures and remedies as described above in response to Q31 and Q31.1.Digital markets are more dynamic and fast changing than traditional markets and the roles of the actors can change quickly. Voluntary commitments to certain standards might be practical measures to achieve similar solutions such as with \u201chard\u201d remedies or obligations as described in response to Q31 and Q31.1.Under the European model, one of the most effective forms of procedural safeguard may be something similar to an oral hearing. However, in antitrust and merger control, the oral hearing comes at a relatively advanced stage. To increase its effectiveness, in an NCT investigation, the oral hearing procedure could be used at multiple stages. This would need to be before the decision to open an (in-depth) NCT investigation (i.e. on the finding of a structural competition problem) and, later, before the decision to impose remedies (i.e. on the appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies). Both of these decisions are likely to have significant cost implications for the affected undertakings and should therefore be subject to an effective procedural safeguard. Moreover, it is logical that these hearings should be split, since they concern very different issues on which market participants are likely to have diverging views and interests.Please refer to Q37.1 above.Affected companies should have the rights to challenge the Commission\u2019s findings (and remedies) before the EU courts also with regard to any new tools. The EU Courts must be entitled to conduct the same intensity of judicial review as for antitrust and merger control decisions and not afford the Commission too great a margin of discretion of complex economic matters. Allowing for a full and substantial legality review would also increase the legitimacy of the NCT as an apolitical, objective instrument for market regulation. The fact that the NCT does not provide for fines or infringements should not impact the intensity of the judicial review. The intensity of the General Court\u2019s review of the legality of Commission decisions does not notably vary between quasi-criminal antitrust decisions and merger decisions (which similar to the NCT, have no fines or infringements attached). Moreover, intense scrutiny of the NCT decisions would help rather than weaken its effectiveness as a tool, as the scrutiny encourages rigour in the analytical process and helps to sharpen the Commission\u2019s internal decision-making process. Also, as the NCT would have no clear precedent to draw on, an active role for the Courts will be necessary to shape the boundaries of the tool, and in order to ensure the consistent application of EU law.Options 3&4 together.","642":"In  our  opinion  the  first  two  pillars  are  necessary  and  effective  means  to  address  the  identified  gaps \nregarding structural competition problems of gatekeepers and tipping markets.

However, the NCT options being put \nforward risk going beyond this scope by extending the application beyond digital gatekeepers. Rather than \nfocusing  on  the  core  of  the  problem,  a  wider  application  to  basically  all  digitally  enabled  industries  is \nenvisaged.

Beyond that the UK system includes a highly \ntransparent process and allows for a fast and effective judicial redress.

In any case it would need to be equipped with the necessary safeguards. For one the threshold \nfor using such a pervasive tool should be high, meaning that it should only be applicable in situations where \ncompetition problems arise on a Europe-wide level and are of a certain magnitude.

This does not allow the Commission to intervene timely and to avoid monopolisation and irreparable harm to the competitive structure in the market.In the automotive sector, the connected agreement of technologies by OEMs around the concept of Extended Vehicle and its standardization by the definition of a number of ISO standards, has de facto created a concerted practice in connected vehicle development, that exclude third parties from having the same benefit and capabilities in providing certain mobility services that OEMs have.The possibility for connected vehicle's users to choose products and services from the provider of their choice is highly limited by the technologies agreed by the vehicle manufacturers to limit the direct vehicle accessibility and ability to provide competing services and products directly in the vehicle. Vehicle producers have therefore the capability to offer products and services through the full value chain, from spare parts to aftersales services.","649":"The European Commission should define a set of rules to allow investigation and prevention of practices that in the long run could lead to market competition issues.

It can use this dominant position to access a richer set of data and provide competing services with higher accuracy and efficiency.Ensure fair and equal access to in-vehicle data and functions.","651":"With the digitalization of traditional products and services, competition problems may occur quite widely. The expansion of Internet of things in the mobility sector is an example at hand. Diagnostic and prognostic services on the vehicles functionalities were in the past only possible by a physical inspection in garages. With the increased connectivity of the vehicles, it is now possible to move competition directly into the vehicle on the road before even a problem can be evident.","652":"When addressing competition issues in the digital sector, data accessibility and the conditions around it are fundamental to define market players' role and relative power and position in the market. Therefore, the new competition tool should focus its attention on how data are produced, accessed and shared in order to ensure a fair level playing field and avoid distortion in market competition.When a gatekeeper uses certain data to provide services, he cannot limit access to such data to competing service providers. For downstream service providers, data is to be considered as \"essential facilities\" in which case OEMs need to provide fair access to such data.","653":"In case of market trends and practices giving rise to possible competition concerns in the long run, it would be difficult to demonstrate the future damage. In this case recommendations and sectoral regulations may be needed.As widely explained in the answers given before, the remedies for potential unfair competition practices should be effective in the elimination of the structural problem, being an agreed technological development (gatekeeper role) or a business practice that allows infrastructure to exploit inputs at a higher degree to what allowed to third parties.","654":"In the Internet of Things domain, the complexity of certain practices and its relation to claimed side consequences like cybersecurity and privacy needs should be carefully assessed and clarified to ensure fair competition in a safe environment.The role of experts is needed as external reviewers practices, claims and technologies are being investigated.In case of connected cars, the new models being introduced on the market every year bring a technology that represents more and more a market restriction for many automotive service suppliers .

There are currently more than 450 members based in different countries around the globe. The Association does not represent companies but is made up of individuals as experts in the area of competition law. Because of their role, in-house competition lawyers have a clear interest in a simple and straightforward competition law regime that prioritises legal certainty, minimises costs, and does not represent a disproportionate demand on businesses\u2019 time and resources. This submission represents the position of ICLA, and does not necessarily represent the views of all of its individual members.","656":"Given ICLA\u2019s broad and diverging membership, we will focus on responding to Section D and E. We are not able to provide a response to Q6, Q7, or the following questions of this section. To the extent any answers are provided for this Section C, they have only been provided as it is required to respond to the question in order to make a submission.","657":"ICLA strongly believes that there is no need for a NCT.\nStructural competition problems that may exist should be addressed via the existing tools under Art 101 and 102 TFEU. The Commission should focus on breaches of competition law. It should not be able to circumvent the required standards of proof, by seeking to remedy situations for which it is not able to show an infringement. Where necessary, the existing competition law framework could be improved and updated to address potential issues or enforcement hurdles (see Q25.1 below) \u2013 without however creating an additional enforcement tool.\nHowever, if the Commission is convinced that (i) there are serious structural competition problems; (ii) such competition problems cannot be addressed based on current tools; and (iii) a NCT is required to address those concerns, ICLA believes the following safeguards are essential:\n-The NCT should be used in exceptionally rare circumstances only and limited to address the types of serious \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 the Commission believes need to be addressed\n-The Commission must identify the specific features of a given market or type of behaviour that have to be present in order to commence an investigation under the NCT\n-Any proposal should lay out the standard of proof that the Commission must meet before starting an investigation. This is necessary to ensure legal certainty for businesses. Such standard should be based on a reasonable theory of harm\n-Any proposal should set out clear procedures with appropriate checks and balances and rights of defence. It should be subject to strict time limits. Under the NCT, companies might find themselves subject to an investigation without having breached the law. See Q34.1 below\n-Given the potential significant impact of a NCT process, the Commission should consider creating a \u2018pre-investigation\u2019 stage. Only if and when such review results in the finding of a structural competition problem that the Commission believes cannot be addressed through Art 101 or 102 TFEU, an NCT investigation should start. Such \u2018pre-investigation\u2019 phase should run separately from the actual \u2018investigation\u2019 phase\n-Companies in a market under investigation must have ample opportunity to express their views throughout the process as well as the right to be heard by the decision-makers\n-Throughout the process, the Commission should remain open-minded, and be willing to close the investigation if it does not find structural competition problems that could not be addressed through regular 101\/102 TFEU enforcement \n-A final decision should only include non-binding recommendations to policy-makers or sectorial regulators. It could also lead to voluntary commitments offered by the targeted companies. It should not include imposing (structural) remedies. See Q30.1 below \n-A full judicial review procedure before the EU Courts is needed to ensure the respect of the rights of defence and create legal certainty. See Q39.1 belowAs mentioned in Q24.1, ICLA believes there is no need for any New Competition Tool to address or prevent any potential structural competition problems. \nThe Commission can use its existing wide-ranging powers under Regulation 1\/2003 to tackle competition problems. The existing tools could be applied more efficiently, and if the Commission believes that there are competition concerns that it cannot address under the current framework, and that need to be addressed, it should focus on improving the application and effectiveness of the current toolbox \u2013 through the ongoing reviews of the Market Definition Notice, the Horizontal and Vertical Block Exemption Regulations and Guidelines, as well as the consultations around potential new legislative measures. One should carefully assess the impact of those changes, before seeking to introduce a tool that could have wide-ranging and significant impact on businesses. These investigations are costly and create great uncertainty on the market as well as issues of legal certainty. \nFurthermore, ICLA does not believe that Art 103 and 114 TFEU form a valid legal basis for the NCT, which would mean that the Commission\u2019s initiative is lacking any sound foundation in law:\n- Art 103 allows the enactment of laws to give effect to the principles set out in Art 101 and 102 TFEU, but it does not allow new competition enforcement powers that go beyond these principles. Art 101 and 102 define the scope of antitrust enforcement, and secondary legislation cannot exceed this pre-defined scope.\n- Art 114 concerns the harmonization of national laws of the Member States that hinder free movement of goods, services, capital or people and therefore obstruct the internal market. There is, however, no danger that a UK-style system (imposition of remedies post sector inquiry) is hindering the internal market. In the UK itself, there are very few cases, mostly related with national markets such as supermarkets, and the UK is exiting the EU. The other two countries that have legislation providing for a similar system (Romania and Greece) do not have any enforcement practice that can provoke fear that the internal market is being disrupted.\n- Given the far-reaching nature of the new enforcement tool, the appropriate legal basis for any NCT seems to be Art 352, which would require the full support of all Council members and involvement of the national parliaments.\nFinally, while the \u2018Market Investigation\u2019 tool that exists in the UK may serve as inspiration for designing the new tool, there are several checks and balances in the UK which would be difficult to replicate in a different legal system (such as an independent panel taking the decision). The existence at national level of a market investigation tool should not be used as a justification for the introduction of an NCT at the European level, in a different legal environment, and with markets across Europe that could present very different characteristics.Please see our response to Question 24.1. and 25.1. above.","658":"Due to its broad membership, ICLA does not take a position on whether there are any potential structural competition law concerns or about the sectors in which potential competition issues may arise. That being said, if the Commission were to introduce a new tool, a number of principles should be considered to ensure sufficient checks and balances are in place \u2013 see our response to Questions 24.1. and 25.1. above).Please see our earlier response to Question 24.1. above.\nAs mentioned above, a final decision should at most be about making non-binding recommendations to policy-makers or sectorial regulators, or accepting during the process voluntary commitments offered by the companies. It would be improper to have more intrusive measures when no breach of law has been found. More specifically, without proof of a competition law violation, any tool should not impose structural remedies as they can have drastic consequences for companies, potentially even more intrusive than fines. Furthermore, imposing structural remedies might constitute a violation of fundamental rights (e.g., freedom of enterprise and of ownership) and therefore require a proper legal basis and a special justification. Such justification may not be available for the circumstances and the facts that the Commission may be seeking to address. \nWhile we do not consider that the Commission should be able to impose remedies through any new NCT, we do believe that if the Commission were to have such power, the Commission must make sure that at least the same procedural safeguards are in place as those applicable to an Art 101\/102 TFEU infringement procedure.Please see our earlier response to Question 24.1.","659":"Please see our earlier response to Questions 24.1 and 30.1 above.\nAny New Competition Tool that is meant to allow the Commission to intervene outside the scope of Art 101 and 102 TFEU to address certain market behaviour should be limited to making non-binding recommendations to policymakers or sectorial regulators, or accept voluntary measures offered unilaterally by the targeted companies. Such process must respect fundamental rights and ensure a proper debate where all the issues can be considered.As mentioned above, ICLA does not believe it is appropriate to introduce a New Competition Tool. However, if the Commission were to decide otherwise, we do agree that enforcement of any New Competition Tool would require adequate and appropriate investigation power for that tool to be effective.Dawn raids are intrusive measures and supposed to be carried out only when a competition authority believes that a company might be in breach of competition law rules. Taking into account that any New Competition Tool would be an \u201cex-ante\u201d intervention without there being any indication of a violation of competition rules, it is not appropriate to allow for the possibility to carry out inspections at the premises of targeted companies (or their representatives).\nAs far as requests for information are concerned, the Commission currently sends out many requests on a so-called \u2018informal\u2019 basis, under Art 18.1 Regulation 1\/2003. Especially against the background that any NCT procedure would be run in the absence of a competition law violation, it seems most appropriate to focus on such \u2018informal\u2019 questionnaires \u2013 and certainly limit as much as possible the power the Commission may have to issue formal questionnaires (such as those referred to in Art 18.2 Regulation 1\/2003). \nIn terms of the power to obtain independent expert opinions, relevant industry participants should be given ample opportunity to provide factual information and share their expertise \u2013 which may include industry studies or reports or input provided by independent experts in the field. However, given the nature of the procedure, we believe this input should be provided voluntarily by the relevant industry participants, which are best placed to talk about relevant market dynamics.\nInterviews with company management and personnel may be key to allow a targeted company to provide additional context and clarify the accuracy of the facts. However, \u2018compelling\u2019 companies to be submitted to such interviews may be a very intrusive measure for the type of investigation we are talking about (i.e. without there being any indications of a competition law violation).\nWe refer to our response to Question 24.1. above for key principles that should be taken into account were the Commission to decide to introduce a New Competition Tool.As mentioned, ICLA is not in favour of introducing a NCT for the reasons mentioned above. However, if this new tool were adopted, it would be of utmost importance to set clear legal deadlines. Such deadlines should give adequate legal certainty and clarity to companies that operate in the market\/s that are investigated. \nFurthermore, as long procedures can end up being a costly exercise in terms of time and resources for companies under investigation, it is important that the duration of such investigations is limited to what is necessary for the Commission to come to an informed but swift decision. If one of the outcomes is to propose legislative changes, then the issue can be further debated in front of policy makers.\nWhile parties should have adequate time to respond to any requests for information, prepare for hearings, or respond to any potential allegations, it is at the same time also important for the Commission to take sufficient time to gather information about the features of the targeted market and understand the relevant market dynamics. \nThe Commission should take these factors into account when deciding on the appropriate deadlines. On balance, it does not seem unreasonable to argue that the Commission should seek to come to a resolution and conclusion within a time period of less than 18 months if its role is to make non-binding recommendations or legislative proposals.The use of interim measures should be reserved for use by the Commission in cases of an ex-post intervention in an antitrust investigation for a potential breach of competition rules under Art 101 or 102 TFEU. In these cases, the Commission should carry out a case-by-case assessment to decide whether to impose interim measures and limit such measures in time. In addition, the imposing of such interim measures must require a proper investigation and the existence of a prima facie illegal behaviour. Giving the Commission the possibility to introduce such measures in the absence of a potential breach of competition law would not only fall outside the scope of Art 8 of Regulation 1\/2003, it is also a very intrusive measure that would leave businesses in extreme uncertainty and could cause irreparable harm. It is of relevance that interim measures are not available in the UK to the CMA when they carry out a market investigation and it has been considered as improper the use of such power in this context.Please see our earlier response to Question 24.1.Please see our earlier response to Question 24.1.As mentioned above, ICLA does not consider that it would be appropriate for the Commission to impose remedies in this type of investigations. However, in case the Commission seeks to impose non-binding recommendations, or the relevant companies may seek to offer voluntary commitments, it would be helpful for the Commission to consult with relevant third parties in case those remedies would have a possible business impact on those parties. Such third-party consultations, if introduced, should however be streamlined to avoid as much as possible further delays in the procedure, or third parties abusing the process to obtain commercial gains.As mentioned in our response to Question 24.1 above, it is absolutely critical for any New Competition Tool to provide adequate procedural safeguards, including full judicial review. As mentioned, legal certainty would be key for any new tool the Commission may be considering. The process should also be subject to strict time limits. There is a severe risk of negative effects on markets if companies are caught up for long periods of time in investigations which would be document-intensive and where the potential outcome could slow or stop investment. Procedures need to be clearly defined, so that companies involved have a clear view of the relevant process, be given ample opportunity to provide factual input, and have the ability to respond to the Commission findings. \nIt would be important for the parties for be able to challenge the process and the outcome via a speedy review of the EU Courts. This would be particularly important if the Commission were granted powers to impose remedies to the companies affected. Furthermore, appeals should have suspensive effects, or at the very least it must be made clear that the affected party\/parties have access to interim measure proceedings.\nIn any potential New Competition Tool, the Commission should involve different internal departments that have expertise in the markets investigated (for instance, DG CONNECT for telecommunications or digital market investigations) and ensure that these departments can provide input throughout the process.\nThe above safeguards are especially critical given the absence of a competition law violation by the companies under investigation, and the fact that the EU Commission does not have the additional safeguard, applied to UK CMA market investigations, of the appointment of an independent panel of experts, separate from the CMA investigatory team, to take the Decision. They are absolutely indispensable in the event that the Commission, contrary to ICLA\u2019s view, seeks to impose remedies including structural remedies on the companies investigated.Given ICLA\u2019s broad and diverging membership, we are not able to provide a response to this question.","660":"Twitter is what\u2019s happening in the world and is a real time, global information service that allows people to view and share Tweets. Twitter is available in more than 40 languages around the world, and can be accessed via Twitter.com, an array of mobile devices via Twitter owned and operated mobile applications (e.g. Twitter for iPhone and Twitter for Android), and SMS.  The platform allows users to consume, create, distribute, and discover content and has democratised content creation and distribution.  From breaking news and entertainment, to sports, politics, and everyday interests, Twitter users provide insight into every angle of a story.

For example, Twitter currently uses Google Cloud.  \nA:Concentrated Market:The presence of one or two large players on the market can generate structural competition problems as this structure enables large players to impose conditions on other players on the market and reduces their incentives to participate in competition-enhancing multilateral cooperation (e.g., in relation to interoperability & data portability).\nB:Vertical Integration:A high degree of vertical integration of a player with market power can lead to structural competition problems because it often leads to preferencing by the player with market power of its upstream or downstream integrated business to the detriment of independent competitors, reducing incentives for players to participate in competition-enhancing multilateral cooperation (e.g., in relation to interoperability disclosures, standards & data portability).\nE:Regulatory Barriers: Industry-wide regulations that impact content and digital advertising risk creating increasing operating costs for businesses, particularly new entrants, and small\/ medium-sized companies such as Twitter. Regulations are inherently complex in application and subject to further rulemaking, opinions, guidance, and potential penalties, that the cumulative effect is to create barriers to competition. Complexity and uncertainty is the result that tends to benefit incumbents. It impacts entry, affects exit and change in response to market dynamics, and impedes new, disruptive business models that may do more to enhance competition and create consumer value. Dominant companies have a distinct advantage as they have financial resources to comply with any regulations, leaving smaller\/mid-sized companies struggling with regulatory compliance costs. This takes away resources that smaller companies might otherwise devote to innovating and developing stronger businesses to compete. This risk can exist for regulations that are focused on other aspects of platform businesses, for e.g., copyright or privacy regulations.\nResearchers from University of Tilburg recently released a paper on the impact of GDPR on ad tech and found precisely this, observing that GDPR has had \u201cadverse effects on competition by strengthening the position of Google and other large online platforms on digital markets\u201d in part because rivals \u201chave been less capable of absorbing the implementation costs of the GDPR and coping with the restrictions on the collection and processing of data.\u201d For this reason, the report recommends that the Commission \u201cexamine the differentiated effects of the GDPR to different-sized companies.\u201dhttps:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3598130H:Switching Costs:In principle, it is relatively easy for consumers to start using a new social networking service by setting up an account. However, there are a number of challenges that users face in deciding whether to start using a new social networking service. To many consumers, the value of using a social networking service depends on the presence of their friends or broader social circle on that same social network. The lack of a robust user base that includes already connected individuals in people\u2019s social circles, and the corresponding lack of a person\u2019s social circle content on the social network, presents a significant hurdle for users signing up to a new network. This is particularly true for users considering switching between social networking services that they intend to use for the same or similar purposes (such as interacting with friends and family). \nM:Multi-homing: Twitter customers frequently multi-home across rival services, and the existence of cross-posting among platforms helps to increase multi-homing across rival services. Thus, the inability of users to switch due to interoperability or data portability barriers can be a serious structural competition problem, because it prevents entry or expansion by firms challenging the dominant provider with the largest user base.  Interoperability and data portability standards that reduce barriers to switching improve users' and advertisers' ability to choose, and competing providers' ability to compete, on the merits. \nO:Financial Strength:significant financial strength can generate structural competition problems in the case of firms that either already possess market power, or that enter a new market by leveraging their strong market position and resulting financial strength to enter a neighboring market. This financial strength allows the companies concerned to sidestep merit-based competition and acquire a user base by providing features under predatory conditions (offering users service features that bear no relationship to financial returns expected from those features, for a period long enough to inflict severe financial harm on the competition), or by acquiring a) attractive user bases or b) competitive threats that can be eliminated, without being subject to the same financial restraints.Extending power to other markets can be a structural competition problem where a firm with market power has a must-have product and can use customers' reliance on that product to provide other products.  Customers thus do not choose those other products on the merits, but on the need to continue to access the must-have product, leading to structural competition problems.","662":"Gatekeeper scenarios: gatekeeper scenarios can be a problem where the gatekeeper is able to impose barriers to switching and refuses to facilitate interoperability, locking in users and the existing market structure other than on merit-based considerations. Similarly, where Gatekeepers control access to supply, tooling, data, or demand they alone are  able to write rules for the industry, which may make  it difficult for other companies to compete and often benefit that Gatekeeper in other vertical markets. ","663":"Tipping: Tipping can imply structural competition problems in markets characterised by network effects as it tends to confer benefits on the beneficiaries of tipping that are not necessarily merit-based, but rather, result from the size of the ever-more locked in user base.  Interoperability and data portability measures would go a long way towards ensuring that products and services compete on their merits. ","664":"Current investigative procedures regarding situations where structural competition problems may arise due to strategies by companies with market power to extend their market position into related markets take too much time before a remedy is imposed, often resulting in the remedy being less effective or ineffective once it is in place.  This issue is particularly problematic in contexts where a firm with market power has replicated similar behaviours in a variety of related markets, which the Commission is unable to investigate all at once.  Moreover, the remedies imposed in response to the infringement are often unable to address the structural damage inflicted on the market.","665":"In addition, the Commission should have the power in situations structural competition problems may arise due to repeated strategies by companies with market power to extend their market position into related markets to impose restorative remedies that do not necessarily mirror the infringement but rather address the underlying structural competition problems caused or furthered by the infringement.\nThe shortcomings highlighted in our answer to Question 9.2 above are mainly of a procedural nature.  That said, the Commission has taken an important step in condemning preferencing behaviour by dominant firms and to the extent that the General Court were to find that such behaviour is not covered by Articles 101 or 102 TFEU, the conclusion must be that these articles are insufficient to address such market situations.  ","666":"Further, there are cases where network effects drive competition to a winner-take-all situation in the absence of a clear abuse, leading to market circumstances in which by nature there is little or no competition.  Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are ill-suited to address such market circumstances, and in such a scenario, the Commission should be empowered to correct the loss of competition resulting from the convergence to a single player with monopoly market shares, e.g., by imposing interoperability, data portability and\/or similar requirements.","667":"However, there are a number of challenges that users face in deciding whether to start using a new social networking service. To many consumers, the value of using a social networking service may depend on the presence of others on that same social network.  For other consumers, there may be a greater focus on contemporaneous information, and the number of users may contribute to the volume and frequency of user generated content.  The lack of a robust user base can present a significant hurdle for users signing up to a new network. This is particularly true for users considering switching between social networking services that they intend to use for the same or similar purposes (such as interacting with friends and family). \nThe ability of different platforms to interoperate reduces the risk of a market tipping to a single player.","668":"Tipping is perhaps more common in digital markets than in other sectors because digital markets commonly display the features highlighted in Question 16.3.The characteristics mentioned in Question 16.7 are characteristics one typically sees in the context of tipping markets. The market tips towards one player, competitors are marginalised, customers have less choice, and pressures to innovate are reduced.Enhanced powers to intervene early would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission\u2019s enforcement.\nAs outlined in our response to question 9, there are a number of shortcomings to articles 101\/102 of TFEU in reacting timely to market situations, therefore, the Commission should be empowered to intervene in \u201ctipping markets\u201d e.g., by imposing interoperability, data portability and\/or similar requirements.Twitter believes that rules enabling certain regulatory intervention against Gatekeeper platforms on a case-by-case basis would be the most effective way to protect users of the platforms and create competitive opportunities for other industry players.  Without a full analysis, it is difficult to identify the sectors\/markets concerned but Twitter does believe there are Gatekeeper scenarios in digital sectors\/markets. ","669":"\nTwitter believes gatekeepers should be limited to those companies with market power and the ability to exert control over how other companies compete.  It has a very high market share on a primary market and achieved a scale that renders it an unavoidable supplier for its customers. It also has also engaged in conduct that has limited competitors ability to gain market share. These might include self-preferencing, denying access to APIs, or limiting multihome and data portability. ","670":"Additional features might be: significant vertical or horizontal integration, enabling control over access to related markets and the accumulation of unmatchable collections of data, which protect the gatekeeper's data-based services or advertising-based revenue models.\nA key feature of gatekeeper scenarios is that a company with market power is able to exert control over how other companies compete against it, by controlling competitors' access to and\/or interoperability with the platform which it operates. ","671":"Although customers might theoretically be able to switch, they might practically be unable to do so because of effective switching barriers, or the extent to which the gatekeeper platform is able to marginalise competitors and limit their effectiveness and hence their attractiveness to customers.  Moreover, the ability of customers to switch might not be decisive in determining whether a company is a gatekeeper where a company is able to influence access of competitors without this affecting customers' choices on the market on which the company exercises market power.In scenarios where a company with market power is in a position to act as gatekeeper, there may be a need for the Commission to be able to intervene to address structural competition problems, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its enforcement.  However Twitter believes this depends on how gatekeeper is defined, the relevant market involved, and the proposed remedies. Any intervention should be tailor-made following an investigation into their conduct. \nAs outlined in our previous responses, there are a number of shortcomings to articles 101\/102 of TFEU in reacting timely to market situations, therefore, the Commission should be empowered to intervene in markets characterised by gatekeeper platforms e.g., by imposing interoperability, data portability and\/or similar requirements.Structural competition problems occur in all markets and are not unique to digital markets.","672":"\nThe EU Commission should have a variety of tools at its disposal to address structural competition problems related to firms with high levels of market power, including legislating on presumed abusive practices and issuing guidance targeting specifically dominant firms, including, e.g., dominant firms benefiting from network effects or in a gatekeeper position.\nThe EU Commission should have the power to impose on firms with high degrees of market power any and all types of effective remedies. These remedies should include remedies that do not merely mirror the infringement but which are aimed at restoring competition.","673":"\nEnforcement of the new competition tool by the European Commission requires adequate and appropriate investigative powers, similar to those currently already available to the Commission in the context of competition enforcement.Investigative powers, similar to those currently already available to the European Commission in the context of competition enforcement would be appropriate.\nThe inclusion of binding legal deadlines would enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the new competition tool.\nProviding for the ability to impose interim measures would enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the new competition tool.\nVoluntary commitments are not as effective as binding decisions in enforcing competition law against strongly dominant firms, because they do not set a forceful precedent and because they commonly are limited in time, unlike binding decisions.\nMarket participants' rights should be safeguarded among other ways by ensuring that they have the possibility to comment on the findings of a structural competition problem..\nMarket participants' rights should also be safeguarded by ensuring that they have the possibility to comment on the remedies.\nMarket participants' rights should be safeguarded by ensuring that the new competition tool should be subject to adequate procedural safeguards, including judicial reviewWe believe a regulatory regime that would provide for the imposition of tailor-made remedies on gatekeeper companies following an investigation into their conduct may help prevent misuse of this gatekeeper power, to protect consumers and to create competitive opportunities for smaller market participants.\n","674":"Press publishers are particularly affected by the ever-increasing market power of these \nmega-platforms.  In  fact,  these platforms do not  limit  themselves  to  their  (monopoly) \nintermediary  role.  They  constantly  broaden  the  scope  of  their  activities  by  invading \nadjacent niche markets \u2013 which allows them to collect further data and information to \nbe fed back into the primary (monopoly) intermediary market. In many cases they also \nenter  into  unfair  competition  with  press  publishers,  particularly  on  downstream \nmarkets.  Routinely,  such  mega-platforms  commercially  offer,  supply  and  provide \naccess to content for which they did not bear any of the production costs or original \ninvestment  and  use  it  to  substitute  content  producers  and  distributors,  while  at  the \nsame time securing an increasing share of digital advertising budgets.

With  the \nEuropean Commission's Decision in the case AT.39740 - Google Search (Shopping) \ndated 27 June 2017, for the first time, a digital platform monopolist was prohibited from \ngiving preference to its own offerings over offerings from competitors on its monopoly \nplatform. ","676":"This case also illustrates the need for comprehensive improvements to the legal and \nadministrative instruments for ensuring fair competition on dominant platforms, if we \nwant to maintain economic (and editorial) competition in Europe. The Commission's \nprohibition  of  self-preferencing  against  the  search  monopoly  is  an  important  and \npossibly  historic  step  in  adapting  the  general  prohibition  of  abusive  practices  to  the \nrealities of the platform economy in a networked world. ","677":"However,  the  decision  alone  is  not  yet  sufficient.  It  is  not  yet  legally  binding,  its \nimplementation  is  substantively  deficient,  and  its  limitation  to  the  \"comparison-\nshopping\" market as well as its limited legal consequences are far from sufficient to \nensure fair competition between those companies that rely on neutral search. ","678":"The  European  Commission's  intention  to  ensure  that  competition  policy  and \ncompetition rules are up-to-date is in principle to be welcomed for the reasons outlined \nabove.  However,  the  specific  design  of  an  additional  instrument  to  improve  the \nenforcement  of  competition  law  in  detail  will  be  crucial  in  order  to  ensure  the \neffectiveness of the new measures. In order to address the key challenges of restoring \nand  ensuring  fair  competition  in  digital  markets  characterised  by  large  gate-keeper \nplatforms, and in order not to go beyond the set target, it may be appropriate to limit \nthe  scope  of  the  new  measures  to  the  problematic  digital  platform  markets.  In  any \nevent,  a  wide  application  of  the  envisaged  measures,  which  would  pose  significant \nrisks to those markets that are not characterised by unequal competition and the same \nenforcement problems, should be avoided. It goes without saying that it is difficult to \nassess the content of such measures before their scope and conditions for intervention \nare further specified. ","679":"In order to restore and secure fair competition in the (digital) internal market in the long \nterm,  it  must  be  ensured  that  both  initiatives,  the  ex  ante  regulation  and  the  New \nCompetition  Tool,  do  not  overlap  or  undermine  each  other.  Accordingly,  the  New \nCompetition Tool cannot be an alternative to the necessary ex ante regulation of digital \ngatekeeper mega-platforms. We therefore particularly welcome the clarification in the \ninception impact assessment that the New Competition Tool should be complementary \nto the ex ante regulation. For this reason, we would in principle consider it appropriate \nto restrict the planned measure\u2019s scope of application to the area of the digital markets, \nwhich  are  characterised  by  the  gatekeeper  mega-platforms,  in  order  to  prevent  an \noverreaching  scope.  The  public  consultations  and  impact  assessments  on  both \ninitiatives should inter alia ensure that consistency is ensured and overlap between the \ntwo initiatives is avoided. ","680":"EMMA-ENPA have taken note of the four regulatory options presented in the European \nCommission\u2019s  inception  impact  assessment.  Options  3  or  4  of  the  inception  impact \nassessment would not require any market dominance, nor an abuse for intervention. \nOptions 1 and 2, on the other hand, would require a finding of market dominance with \nthe  companies  concerned,  but  would  not  require  the  existence  of  an  abuse  under \nArticle 102 TFEU. In both cases, the conditions for intervention would be significantly \nreduced  compared  to  the  standard  of  general  competition  law.  However,  a \nproportionate design of the envisaged additional rules appears to be essential in order ","681":"                                                                                                                             \n \n \n \n\fto  avoid  unwanted  negative  effects  on  other  competitive  markets.  We  therefore \nconsider  that  the  New  Competition  Tool  should  complement  ex  ante  regulation  of \ngatekeeper platforms and, in any case, should only be applied in cases where sector-\nspecific regulation such as ex ante regulation is not applicable. This would require that \nthe New Competition Tool be limited to the very area of gatekeeper mega-platforms. ","682":"Against this background, we must express concerns about all the options presented in \nthe  inception  impact  assessment.  As  no  concrete  conditions  for  intervention  or \nconstitutive elements of a \"structural competition problems\" are known for options 3 \nand  4,  we  consider  these  approaches  to  be  too  broad  at  this  stage.  To  avoid  low \nhurdles for intervention by the competition authority, it is essential that the criteria for \nintervention,  in  particular for \"structural competition  problems\",  be  specified  in more \ndetail. Taken individually, all the elements of definition present a risk of intervention in \nmarkets which are not characterised by the same challenges as the platform markets, \ncharacterised by digital gatekeeper platforms. ","683":"Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple\u2019s five software platforms \u2014 iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple\u2019s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.Please see response to questions 3 and 4.1.- Software platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS\n- App Store\n- Apple Music\n- Apple TV\n- Apple Arcade \n- Apple Pay\n- iCloud\/CloudKit \n- Final Cut Pro\n- iMovie\n- Garageband\n- Numbers, Pages, Keynote\n- Sign-in with AppleApple is predominantly a provider of digital services but also use digital services of other companies (for instance online sales of products, application stores, or cloud services).The 18 market features presented in question 6 are difficult to evaluate in the abstract, and we have therefore ranked the features based on our experience in the digital economy, which is generally characterized by very intense competition and continuous innovation. We would like to elaborate on some of these market features in particular: ","684":"This is not a problem in itself as long as competition among the relevant players results in innovative products and services. Apple may be a large company, but it faces intense competition in both the hardware and digital service markets. Apple does not have a dominant share in any market.","685":"A high degree of vertical integration in itself does not represent a structural competition problem. On the contrary, vertical integration is not incompatible with intense competition and can increase it. The benefits of vertical integration are recognized in the Commission\u2019s Guidelines on Non-Horizontal Mergers: they lead to the elimination of double-marginalization and lower the marginal cost of selling in downstream markets. These efficiencies lead to lower prices, expanded output, and increased investment \u2014 all which enhance competition and benefit consumers. The Special Advisers\u2019 Report (p.62) makes clear that rules applied by vertically-integrated platforms are anti-competitive only when they \u201cimpede free, undistorted and vigorous competition without objective justification, [\u2026] anti-competitively exclude or discriminate [\u2026] [or] determine the outcome of the competition\u201d. What matters is how an undertaking conducts its business. This requires a robust, case-by-case effects analysis and a fully-fledged theory of harm. The integration of hardware, software and services has been a longstanding tenet of Apple\u2019s business model and has been hugely beneficial to competition and innovation in the markets in which Apple operates. This is an important competitive differentiator vis-\u00e0-vis other firms active in the smart mobile device space. Far from harming competition, it has contributed to the success of companies like Netflix and Spotify and the extremely competitive markets in which they compete.","686":"High switching costs in some instances may contribute to structural competition problems. However, the existence and significance of switching costs must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The ability and willingness of marginal users to switch to other platforms or services in response to a price increase or degradation in choice quality will often be sufficient to impose a competitive constraint. By way of example, even if \u2013 notwithstanding readily available migration tools \u2013 some Apple iOS users were reluctant to switch to Android mobile devices because of perceived switching costs, Apple cannot ignore the fact that a significant proportion of users would in fact be ready to switch. This is reflected in the fact that Apple invests significant resources to update our iOS and hardware (iPhone, iPad, etc.) products each year with new features and functionality to both maintain and draw-in new customers.","687":"Even assuming limited switching, in multi-sided markets there are often multiple channels for developers or content providers to reach users. As an example, Netflix is available on more than six different categories of devices (smart TVs; game consoles; set-top boxes; Blu-Ray players; and smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops). Indeed, as well as having access to the internet from their smartphone via Safari or another mobile web browser, the vast majority of iOS users also have a PC or Mac and thus access to various web-based app stores. Many of them also own a gaming console, e-book reader, smart-TV or associated device, or smart watches. Many of these platforms operate their own app stores too.  ","688":"This is an inherent feature of vertical integration. Many if not most forms of self-preferencing by platforms are pro-competitive and drive innovation. Today\u2019s digital platforms have developed their offerings in contestable markets and owe their success to the benefits they consistently provide to consumers \u2013 they simply cannot be compared to long-time monopolists (such as most sports federations or former public telecommunications monopolies) benefiting from exclusive rights that have never had to compete on the merits and demonstrate their utility to stakeholders. Artificially depriving platforms of the efficiencies of vertical integration should be limited to exceptional circumstances, such as where the platform qualifies as an \u2018essential facility\u2019 under the EU courts\u2019 case law, or has engaged in forms of self-preferencing that have demonstrably excluded competitors from the market and have no or only tenuous consumer benefits.As noted in question 6, the different scenarios presented in questions 6 and 7 are difficult to evaluate in the abstract, and we have therefore ranked the features based on our experience in the digital economy, which is an extremely competitive sector.  In particular:","689":"Highly concentrated markets, which allows the few players present to align their market behavior: A concentrated market does not in itself present a structural competition problem as long as competition among the existing players results in competitive prices, quality, choice, and innovative products and services. The threat of new entry or technological paradigm shifts (such as from fixed to mobile computing) can be a potent constraint even on large players. By way of example, video sharing platform TikTok, has quickly gained a large global user base since it launched on international markets in late 2016, by providing an innovative product and challenged established players. ","690":"As to the other 5 market scenarios, they are only \u201csomewhat important\u201d as they are highly connected to the factual circumstances. For instance, it is clear that the barriers to entry for general internet search (a market dominated by Google) are very significant, whereas they are rather low for messaging apps.","691":"Expansion to new markets is a rational business strategy, which allows platforms to grow their offering and remain attractive for their customers (\u201cinnovate or become obsolete\u201d). This type of expansion is an inherent element of platform competition and, in the majority of cases, increases consumer welfare. As recognized in the CMA\u2019s recent Market Study on Online Platforms and Digital Advertising markets (Page 57, Paragraph 2.37), \u201cintegration of a wide range of products and services can deliver efficiency savings and can also improve the consumer experience overall, by increasing the ease with which a range of different services are accessed.\u201d This market expansion strategy is not limited to the digital sector and can be also observed in more traditional industries.","692":"We believe that the current competition toolbox, and in particular Article 102 TFEU, has provided a reliable and consistent framework for competition enforcers and companies to address anti-competitive forms of leveraging. Barring exceptional cases with evidence of competitive foreclosure by already dominant firms, competition law should encourage, and not discourage, companies to expand to new markets.As noted above, we are of the view that the current competition toolbox has provided a reliable and consistent framework that competition enforcers have been able to apply effectively across all sectors. The notions of \u201cstructural risk for competition\u201d and\/or \u201cstructural lack of competition\u201d are not clearly defined concepts, and can as such become an overly discretionary tool undermining legal certainty and predictability. The assessment of \u2018structural risk for competition\u2019 will be also challenging, given the difficulty of predicting disruptive entries of new players, who can offer novel business models.","693":"The digital sector was in its infancy only two decades ago, and has grown at an extremely rapid pace. It continues to be very dynamic, with a constant flow of new products and services, and new entry and expansion. A mere decade ago, companies such as Airbnb, Uber, Instagram, Snapchat, Stripe, Tinder, Blablacar or Deliveroo did not even exist, and companies such as Spotify were still small start-ups.  While large platforms such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have also expanded the services they offer, this has clearly not deterred a myriad of other platforms.  ","694":"In the absence of market failure, and in particular with respect to non-dominant companies, intervention involves considerable risks of regulatory failure, potentially resulting in lasting damage to consumer welfare, innovation, and undermining the competitive process itself. Second, there is risk of an overly discretionary tool undermining legal certainty and predictability. Any intervention by the Commission should therefore be based on clear evidence of anti-competitive monopolization, and any remedies should be effective and proportionate. Interventions should be justified objectively and take the minimum actions necessary to address the problem identified.Over the past 60 years of their application, Articles 101 and 102 TFEU have shown to be able to capture all types of conduct that harm competition and consumer welfare. It is true that Article 102 TFEU does neither prohibit nor prevent the acquisition of a dominant position as such, but in Apple\u2019s view this has not created any enforcement gaps. Dominance has been found in relation to companies with shares as low as 40%, and in the US, precedent typically requires much higher market shares in monopolization cases.  Where a company is growing its market share fast and at the expense of rivals, it will often be as a result of a superior product or technology, and such conduct should not be discouraged.","695":"The Commission already intervenes in oligopolistic markets when it believes that undertakings are engaging in concerted practices (see answer to questions 13.2 and 13.3 below). There is also a risk, in digital sectors particularly, of defining the relevant market in question too narrowly. This could lead to artificial oligopolistic markets, which are do not adequately take into consideration a company\u2019s competitive environment.","696":"As mentioned above, over the almost 60 years of their application, Articles 101 and 102 TFEU have allowed the Commission to capture all types of conduct that harm competition, including collusion in oligopolistic markets (see ECJ case law since Dyestuffs, case 48\/69, EU:C:1972:70).  In particular in light of the (rebuttable) presumption that contacts between competitors have an influence on their market behavior, the ECJ\u2019s case law already provides a very low intervention threshold for the Commission.","697":"Where it occurs, \u201ctipping\u201d is usually not due to \u201cdisproportionate advantages\u201d for the platform in question, but rather because the benefits from using the service strongly increase with the number of users on both sides of the platform. To take Google\u2019s search engine as an example, search results improve with the number of users and user queries (direct network effects), and the larger the user base, the more advertisers are willing to pay for search results and enhance the functionality of the engine (indirect network effects).   ","698":"When tipping occurs, it will often be limited to smaller networks (e.g. cities in the case of ride-sharing), and its effects may not need to be permanent. Indeed, markets that are prone to tipping due to network effects may still re-tip, as opposed to other natural monopolies (OECD, Global Forum on Competition, Competition For-The-Market\u2014Background Note by the Secretariat, Oct. 22, 2019). Furthermore, some markets which appear to have been tipped might be relatively easily disrupted by a new entry, as users will migrate to a new superior business model or to innovative functionalities. ","699":"Hence, we would encourage the Commission to follow a cautious approach before asking for new powers outside of the existing Treaty provisions.Under the existing competition law framework, competition authorities have tools to intervene early. In the recent Broadcom case, the Commission made use of its existing powers to impose interim measures to tackle conduct that is considered as justifying the New Competition Tool (hereafter \u201cNCT\u201d), i.e. exclusivity and prevention of multi-homing. It also made known that it was prepared to use interim measures more often.","700":"The three concepts used to identify \u201cgatekeeper\u201d companies are extremely broad and vague and, in the digital world, would appear to capture a significant number of very different platforms. For instance, the fact that a platform has a \u201chigh number of customers\/users\u201d may vary depending on the geographical scope of a platform and its market. Many platforms today have arguable a high-number of customers\/users, including LinkedIn, Sony\u2019s PlayStation Network, Spotify, Twitch, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Snapchat, Strava, Uber, Deliveroo, or Steam.","701":"Multi-homing is certainly an important factor to exclude that gatekeeping. However, a company cannot be defined as a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 simply because its users on one side of the platform single home. Competition on the other side of the platforms should also be carefully analysed. For example, in case where single-homing on the user side is the result of \u201czero pricing\u201d, the \u201cpaying\u201d side of the platform (in particular advertisers) will often have competitive options outside of the platform. There may also be important benefits to single homing for first set of users, notably in terms of protection against security breaches, malware, and privacy protection, or overall user experience. The latter contributes to guaranteeing user trust that is at the heart of the attractiveness of online intermediaries for business users. ","702":"The last criterion on \u201cbusiness operators need[ing] to accept the conditions of competition of the platform \u2013 including its business environment \u2013 to reach the customers that use the specific platform\u201d is also highly questionable. Many different types of businesses, regardless of its size or market power, makes use of standard terms and conditions. Standard terms are widespread in the traditional economy, especially in those scenarios where one entity is dealing with a large number of partners. They create efficiencies and ensure that consumers benefit from a consistent service throughout the entire network. They also ensure that distributors (or other partners) are treated equally. The P2B Regulation and consumer protection rules already ensure today that platforms must respect certain rights of business partners and consumers.","703":"As outlined in Apple\u2019s response to the DSA consultation, a loose category of \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 will capture very diverse business models in very different sectors, who operate under a very different set of incentives. Given the benefits of the platform economy (matching different sets of users, incentives to treat them fairly, ability to deliver trust in cross border transactions) policymakers should make clear that the mere nature of operating a platform is not viewed as a structural competition problem. Should anti-competitive practices be made evident linked to a specific operator, these should be tackled by competition law.As already mentioned above, we believe that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU have been applied by the Commission and interpreted by the EU Courts with the latitude necessary to address any behavior that may raise antitrust concerns. This would include behavior of firms that operate in markets characterized by \u2018gatekeeper platforms\u2019. The European Commission should also consider how to approach \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 in the context of competition law. A departure from well-defined concepts of dominance is likely to lead to uncertainty and bring about enforcement challenges, in terms of test for intervention and litigation.","704":"Please see our answers to Questions 9 and 17.3 above.Not applicable.Please see our answers to Questions 9 and 17.3 above. The Commission has already applied the EU competition rules to several important digital platforms in the recent years:  Google Search, Google Android, Google AdSense, Microsoft\/LinkedIn and Amazon E-books. These cases confirm that the Commission has sufficient tools at its disposal to address any \u201cstructural\u201d competition concerns.Not applicable.Apple does not perceive a need for an NCT. Should structural competition problems arise in any market, current competition rules are sufficient to address them. \nPlease see also our answers to Questions 9, 17.3 and 23.1 above.First, intervention in the absence of market failures or against non-dominant firms raise considerable risks of regulatory failure, potentially resulting in lasting damage to consumer welfare, innovation, and undermining the competitive process itself. Second, there is risk of an overly discretionary tool undermining legal certainty and predictability. Any intervention by the Commission should be based on clear evidence of anti-competitive effects, and any remedies should be effective and proportionate. Seeking to \u201cprevent structural competition problems\u201d before they have manifested themselves is clearly disproportionate, as it requires making an accurate prediction about future developments, a difficult task in dynamic markets.","705":"If an NCT is adopted, such a tool should be \u201chorizontal\u201d rather than limited in scope to certain market sectors. The Commission has not presented any evidence supporting the need for a new competition tool limited to certain sectors\/markets. Apple\u2019s own experience is that all of its devices and services face strong competition and accordingly there would not be a need for such a tool in the markets in which it operates.","706":"Tailoring a procedural competition-law instrument to particular sectors (e.g., digital markets) would be unprecedented and raise discrimination concerns, as it would ignore problems that may need to be addressed in other markets. Furthermore, given the fact that most markets are digitizing, defining what is a digital market and what is not will be increasingly difficult in the future. A sector-focused tool would also not be future-proof as markets may evolve in a way that no longer fits any legal definition.Virtually all sectors are affected by digitization. Digital platforms are just another means to provide goods and services, as recent case-law exemplifies.Not applicable.Not applicable.","707":"Secondly, before investigative powers are proposed, the Commission should propose clear criteria for the launch of an investigation under the NCT, as well as adequate procedural rights and safeguards. Before foreseeing new powers, the Commission should (1) establish the need for a new antitrust tool outside of the existing provisions of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and Regulation 1\/2003, (2) propose clear concepts and definitions, (3) establish a clear set of criteria for the launch of an investigation under the NCT, and (4) accompany any new investigative powers with corresponding procedural rights and means of appeal. See further question 39 below.","708":"Should the Commission be granted new powers under the NCT, the procedure to carry out any investigation should be subject to strict requirements, including mandatory deadlines to protect companies from the uncertainty caused by regulatory action.In the recent Broadcom case, the Commission made use of its existing powers to impose interim measures to tackle conduct that is considered as justifying the NCT, i.e. exclusivity and prevention of multi-homing. It also made known that it was prepared to use interim measures more often. In light of this, it is difficult to see why a new antitrust instrument with interim measures should be warranted. Cases requiring urgent intervention would normally involve clear breaches of Articles 101 or 102 TFEU and should thus be conducted under Regulation 1\/2003.Voluntary commitments will often provide a solution that is better tailored to the issues at hand and thus more proportionate.Yes, in particular the companies directly affected by the potential application of an NCT must have the right to be heard, in line with their fundamental rights. It is surprising that the Commission is asking this question. Taking into account the views of companies that operate in the markets concerned can only have a beneficial effect on the quality of final decisions.Yes, for the same reasons as stated in the answer to question 37.European law is based on the primacy of the rule of law and the respect of fundamental procedural rights. The EU Courts require that EU competition enforcement is equally equipped to protect procedural fairness and rights such as right of defense, right to be heard, right of appeal and the general principle of proportionality.","709":"The envisaged NCT could be highly intrusive. It would empower the Commission to impose behavioral and possibly even structural remedies that could in some cases undermine the fundamental right to operate a business (Art 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights). Such measures must be subject to strong procedural safeguards and the Hearing Officer and the European courts should play a central role. It is surprising that the Commission is even asking this question. These procedural safeguards, in addition, protect the Commission itself from adopting arbitrary or discriminatory decisions, or decisions that are simply the expression of value judgments.As stated above, Apple does not believe that any of the proposed options for an NCT are necessary. The current tools are sufficiently effective to manage existing competition concerns, and it is still unclear whether the NCT will be able to address the perceived failures of the current system, which ensuring sufficient legal certainty.","710":"The GSMA represents the interests of mobile \noperators worldwide, uniting more than 750 \noperators and nearly 400 companies in the broader \nmobile ecosystem, including handset and device \nmakers, software companies, equipment providers \nand internet companies, as well as organisations in \nadjacent industry sectors.

We offer intermediation services between accommodations (hotels and other properties) and travellers. Properties decide independently upon the prices and the room availability that they want to offer on our platform and they can (and do) change this in real-time according to their needs (e.g. due to demand on other channels or occupancy levels). The use of our platform is free for consumers and there are no upfront costs for accommodations. In fact, we make substantial upfront investments to market properties on our platform and if, and only if,  a transaction takes place as a result of our services do we charge a small percentage fee of the transaction value to the accommodation. It is essentially a risk free (and cost effective) distribution channel for accommodations. \nIn addition to intermediating accommodations, we have begun to also intermediate experiences (e.g. tickets to tourist attractions, local tour guides).

If a market is contestable, it has a strong disciplining effect on all market participants, even monopolists. For a market to be contestable, entry needs to be feasible. Therefore any assessment of whether a market suffers from structural competition problems should start with an analysis of possible barriers to entry. Many of the market features listed above can potentially be a barrier to entry but it is important to carefully assess them in the overall context of the market dynamics. Some of these features are also offsetting each other. For example, even when there are network effects or economies of scale, it does not necessarily pose a competition problem if at the same time consumers multi-home and thus make multiple platforms (or other distribution channels) viable. For instance, in the accommodation sector Airbnb was able to enter and scale rapidly because there were network effects and multi-homing at the same time.","763":"It is also important to be precise in the assessment of the above mentioned features. For example, travel booking is mentioned as an instance of zero price markets. While it is true that consumers are usually not directly charged by travel platforms, this does not present an entry barrier because platform fees are included in consumer prices and thus a new entry can undercut with lower platform fees and attract business by offering lower consumer prices. Finally, it is important to note that market concentration might be the result of structural competition problems (e.g. high regulatory barriers to entry), not the source of it. Market concentration by itself is not harmful. In fact, it can be the result of particularly intense quality competition where firms incur endogenous sunk costs. \nAd A) Entering into related markets is an essential part of functioning market competition. In fact, often companies that are creating value by solving one problem for their customers find it natural to solve other problems for their customers as well. For example, sportswear companies such as Nike or adidas started out by making athletic shoes and then expanded into clothing and other product categories. In micro-mobility services, companies are increasingly moving from a single product offering such as e-scooters to a variety of adjacent services such as e-bikes, e-vespas, and e-pods. In our very own market, Booking.com started out by offering the opportunity to book hotels online. Now consumers can also book other forms of accommodation, flights, sightseeing attractions, ground transportation and other services. By offering the opportunity to combine these products in a frictionless way, we create value for our customers beyond the stand-alone service. What these examples have in common is that by providing their initial product a company learns about other unfulfilled needs of their customers and then moves to address these needs. \nLeveraging - the practice of a company that enjoys a dominant position in one market using that strength to enter an adjacent market - has acquired a pejorative meaning even though the practice by itself is not abusive. In fact, many forms of leveraging are inherently pro-competitive, even for dominant firms. Indeed, most firms with activities in two or more markets will engage in leveraging conduct all the time. For example, economies of scope - where it is cheaper to produce two products together than to make each separately - are an example of leveraging but are a legitimate advantage. The same principle applies to any other efficiency that can be achieved across markets - be it cost, knowledge, consumer insights, or any other form of legitimate competitive advantage. \nThis is not to say that leveraging can never be anti-competitive. Economic theory and case law (e.g. Google Shopping) have established various forms of abuse, including those taking place in two-sided markets. However, it is important to clearly distinguish between pro-competitive and anti-competitive leveraging. As Jean Tirole, Patrick Rey, and Paul Seabright point out in their seminal paper on the topic: \u201cWe emphasize that it is important to identify these circumstances fairly precisely: behaviour in adjacent markets is different from the direct exercise of monopoly power, and involvement in multiple markets is a normal and often innocent form of industrial activity, and neither of these intrinsically justifies a presumption of suspicion.\u201d\nPlease see our answer to question 7.1 - it applies to digital and non-digital marketsSee answer to question 7.1 - it depends on the circumstances if the conduct is anti-competitiveA structural risk to competition can arise when a company extends its market power into a related market by anti-competitive means, there is a risk that this market suffers irreparable harm, and the anticompetitive behaviour cannot be prohibited in a timely manner by the application of competition law alone. In this instance, the new competition tool could allow for a more timely intervention as there would be no obligation to prove individual wrongdoing.In principle, EU competition law is well suited to deal with anti-competitive leveraging. However, as outlined above, there can be instances where a more timely intervention is needed.","764":"Unfair business practices or a refusal to grant access to inputs can in principle give rise to competition concerns, in particular if such conduct leads to a monopolization of the market. However, not every conduct that puts a competitor at a disadvantage is automatically anti-competitive. Likewise, companies, in particular non-dominant ones, should have no general obligation to supply their competitors. A careful assessment is therefore necessary before any action is taken.","765":"In general search market shares have been stable over the past 10 years with the biggest search engine accounting for more than 90 percent of the market in most EU Member States. There has also not been any entry challenging this position. This market has clearly tipped.Market tipping can occur in particular as a result of strong (indirect) network effects. However, by itself network effects are insufficient to make markets tip. There are plenty of examples (Credit Cards, Video Games, OTAs) where multiple products\/services exist in parallel. This is in particular true in markets with multi-homing or product differentiation. It always depends on the overall competitive dynamics of the market in question.There are only a handful of markets, e.g. general search, that have tipped to monopoly.The main concern is that markets can tip to inefficient outcomes because of anti-competitive behaviour. In the long run, if the market becomes incontestable after tipping, other concerns might arise (e.g. lack of innovation, lack of choice). However, it is worth stressing that market tipping by itself and without resorting to anti-competitive behaviour is not problematic as long as the market remains contestable. ","766":"In fact, competition to \u2018keep\u2019 the market (from innovative new business models and\/or equally large digital platforms) may discipline the large\/dominant platform and\/or the rewards from stealing the market may incentivise stronger, more valiant entry attempts. The disciplining effect of competition for the market has been widely recognised by the European Commission in its assessment of stock exchange mergers, for example, in its assessment of the proposed transaction between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse Group, the Commission stated: \u201cThis high risk \/ high reward profile of entries ensures that entry attempts happen regularly even though only a few of them succeed. Indeed, the threat of entry and the existence of alternatives do constrain incumbents and spur them to innovate more than would be the case absent competition.\u201dThe Commission needs to have the ability to reign in anti-competitive behaviour that could lead to inefficient tipping. However, in general we counsel some caution here as it is hard to identify markets that will tip.In principle, EU competition law is well suited to deal with anti-competitive behaviour, including anti-competitive behaviour by dominant companies that could lead to inefficient tipping. ","767":"However, if there is a risk that a market suffers irreparable harm and the anticompetitive behavior cannot be prohibited in a timely manner by the application of competition law alone, the New Competition Tool should be applicable and allow for timely intervention.We would stress that what sets gatekeepers apart from other platforms (and simply dominant firms) is their ability to control not just one market but entire ecosystems of unrelated markets. Gatekeeper platforms are the central access point to the web and the digital economy. There are only a handful of such firms, e.g. in general search. They sit upstream of other platforms and other business models and control access to a large number of users, which the gatekeeper can (re-)direct to downstream businesses almost at will, including its own verticals.The classic example from the economics literature is supermarkets (see canonical Armstrong paper from 2006) but there are other industries as well, e.g. telecoms, energy, railways.Gatekeeper platforms are the central access point to the web and the digital economy. They sit upstream of other platforms and other business models and control access to a large number of users, which gatekeepers can (re-)direct to downstream businesses almost at will, including their own verticals. Because of their privileged position and sway over users, their position is hard to contest. ","768":"There is no one single criteria that defines a gatekeeper platform. It is rather a cumulation of several criteria that indicate a platform\u2019s systemic role. We would urge the focus to be on the following 3 categories of criteria: 1) the gatekeeper\u2019s core activities span over a significant part of the EU\u2019s internal market, 2) Due to market conditions it holds sway over a significant share of private and\/or business users that primarily single-home. 3) It has the ability and incentive to expand its market power to new and unrelated markets in a manner which would significantly impede effective competition.The main competitive concern is that gatekeepers skew competition in their own favour, which stifles innovation and leads to higher prices, to the detriment of consumers.There is a need for the Commission to be able to in markets that are hard to contest and that are characterized by gatekeepers with persistent market power.Structural competition problems, including those posed by gatekeeper platforms, independent of individual abuse, in markets that are hard to contest and which are unlikely to tend to effective competition are not covered by current EU competition law. ","769":"In certain instances competition enforcement might also take too long to prevent irreparable harm from materializing. Digital markets are extremely dynamic and if enforcement is needed it needs to be fast and effective while at the same time being sufficiently flexible to deal with a wide variety of sectors and conducts. We therefore support the proposed New Competition Tool with its approach to carry out a (time limited) market investigation before any judgment is passed on particular practices.Please see answer 18.6","770":"It can take a number of years for Article 101\/102 cases to reach a decision as to whether specific behaviour in a market or by a company is allowed. In comparison, the less adversarial process of a market investigation, where there is a much lower risk of follow-on litigation, means the New Competition Tool can be expected to deliver decisions more quickly. This may prevent irreversible harm from arising and help ensure markets remain contestable.","771":"The New Competition Tool may be more effective than Article 101\/102 in addressing certain market problems. Market investigations can allow for a more holistic view of the market, a more effective discussion about remedies and solutions, and ensure likely future developments are taken into account. In comparison, the emphasis in Article 101\/102 cases is on past conduct and on fines as opposed to remedies. ","772":"For the New Competition Tool to be deployed most effectively, the Commission should consider adopting a 2-tier approach (at least for those cases where it suspects structural competition problems as opposed to structural risks to competition), similar to the CMA where there is a market study that precedes a market investigation.","773":"This would serve two purposes: \n- it would allow the Commission to undertake exploratory market studies to inform their understanding about how markets function and consumers and suppliers interact, before embarking on a lengthy and costly market investigation. \n- in doing so, it would allow the Commission to confirm if the suspected issue is material, and further assess whether the New Competition Tool would be the most appropriate tool.If there is a risk that a market suffers irreparable harm and the anticompetitive behavior cannot be prohibited in a timely manner by the application of competition law alone, the New Competition Tool should be applicable and allow for timely intervention.","774":"Structural competition problems can arise in markets where there is no dominant company or there is a dominant company but the problematic features (e.g. high barriers to entry) apply to dominant and non-dominant companies alike.

The merger control procedure shows that efficient procedures are possible.  2) Companies need to have legal clarity as soon as possible and be able to plan without being subjected to an uncertain environment for a long time, to avoid devastating effects on innovation and investments.The procedure should be concluded in a timely manner. Thus, there is no need for interim measures.If competition concerns can be alleviated through voluntary commitments that would be the optimal solution for all parties involved.In spirit of the less adversarial nature of the NCT, there should be maximum dialogue and exchange.In spirit of the less adversarial nature of the NCT, there should be maximum dialogue and exchange.As the remedies to be imposed by the Commission are meant to address the specific shortcomings in a market and markets vary substantially, there are not many limits to the Commission\u2019s possible actions. This holds the Commission to a special responsibility as these potentially far reaching remedies will be applied without any finding of wrongful conduct. It also means that there needs to be an opportunity for swift recourse to judicial review to challenge the Commission\u2019s action. We believe it is worth revisiting the debate on whether or not the EU needs a specialized competition court. Such a court would be able to expedite the judicial review as it would be staffed with competition experts and it could also scrutinize the Commission\u2019s decisions in a more substantial way. In this context, it is worth exploring if the standard of judicial review should change for decisions taken under the NCT. The current standard of \u201cmanifest error\u201d might grant the Commission too much discretion when it is applied to matters where there was no full investigation and no finding of wrongful conduct. We note that the market investigation powers held by the CMA are kept in check by the Competition Appeals Tribunal which specialises in competition cases to allow effective, timely and appropriate scrutiny.please see our submission to the Commission\u2019s inception impact assessment","777":"European Horizons is a global, student-led policy incubator committed to giving young people \na voice in shaping the future of Europe and transatlantic relations.

The \nEuropean  Commission  should  therefore  consider  providing  a  more  suitable  legal  basis  to \nensure effective enforcement of the NCT. This could be achieved by relying on the so-called \nflexibility clause described in Article 352 TFEU.

To ensure legal certainty and compliance \nwith the rule of law, it is essential to introduce a test to determine whether there is a genuine \nneed to apply the NCT. To avoid ambiguities in interpretation, the European Commission should \nestablish  clear  guidelines  and  specify  what  precisely  constitutes  \u2018a  structural  risk  for \ncompetition\u2019  and  \u2018a  structural  lack  of  competition.\u2019  Without  implementing  such  a  test,  the \nEuropean  Commission  risks  precipitating  infringements  and  misuses  of  European  law  by \nbypassing standards provided by Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. ","786":"Online platforms such as Facebook and Google with its parent company Alphabet are fast-\nevolving  enterprises  that  quickly  adapt  to  different  market  conditions  and  the  changing \ndemands of consumers.

The multidimensional nature of  online \nplatform activities combined with the growing popularity of digital services means that large \ntechnology  firms  often  exert  influence  beyond  areas  strictly  associated  with  the  digital \nenvironment.

A  good  example  of \nhow  far-reaching  this  influence  on  non-digitally  enabled  markets  can  be  is  Airbnb  and  the \nissues related to its business model.

Equipped with \ndeep  financial  pockets  resulting  from  immense  profits  of  their  power  houses  (Google  for \nAlphabet, Amazon Web Services for Amazon), buying up emerging competition is widespread. \nIn the last decade alone, the five biggest tech companies acquired more than 400 start-ups \nall while facing only limited scrutiny by competition regulators.  ","790":"To  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  the  NCT,  it  is  essential  to  designate  a  new  regulatory  body \nresponsible  for  detecting  and  eliminating  infringements  caused  by  digital  platforms.  As  we \nobserve,  competition  problems  resulting  from  the  growth  of  platform  economies  are \nsubstantially  complex,  and  may  be  too  problematic  to  be  sufficiently  tackled  by  existing \nregulators. Therefore, to take full advantage of the NCT, the European Commission, as well as \nthe Member States, ought to consider introducing a regulatory body which will be designated \nto  exercise  tasks  related  strictly  to  digital  markets  (e.g.  screening  the  digital  market, \nmonitoring platform behaviors, requesting non-personal data information).  ","791":"We believe that the option addresses current competition concerns in the most comprehensive \nway, and allows regulators to take full advantage of ex ante instruments. However, we also \nurge the European Commission to take a closer look into possible overlaps of the NCT with \nthe current competition law framework. Therefore, we recommend the European Commission \nto take the precautions necessary (e.g. to open further consultations on developing specific \ninstruments) to avoid  potential gaps and legal uncertainty. ","792":"Creating European champions has become a buzzword lately, not just in Brussels. However, \nwe want to stress the importance that it should not be the goal of this New Competition Tool \nto artificially create our very own European Googles, Facebooks, and Amazons. The resulting \nissues would be as problematic and worrying as the ones we see today. As long as companies \nplay by European rules it should not bother us whether they are based in the United States, \nin Europe or in Asia. Instead the goal must be to craft rules for a digital environment which \nallows for a plethora of companies, and thus ideas, to thrive without facing a tipping or failed \nmarket. We at Instrat and European Horizons strive for an internet that is not just of and by \nthe people, but for the people.  ","793":"Microsoft welcomes the European Commission\u2019s efforts to strengthen digital safety through \nthe proposed Digital Services Act (DSA). We agree that providers of digital services have an \nimportant  role  to  play  in  helping  people  stay  safe  online\u2014in  particular,  to  design  and \noperate their services responsibly, including by anticipating and reducing digital safety risks \non  their  services.  Promoting  such  behaviour  requires  a  carefully  calibrated  regulatory \nframework,  one  that  encourages  positive  and  thoughtful  action  by  providers  but  does  not \ninadvertently  incentivize  censorship.  As  the  DSA  proposal  moves  forward,  we  respectfully \nurge the Commission to consider the following points. ","794":"Preserve  and  build  upon  the  e-Commerce  Directive  framework.  The  EU's  existing  legal \nframework,  based  on  the  e-Commerce  Directive  (ECD),  has  been  successful  in  promoting \nboth  online  innovation  and  responsible  behaviour  by  providers.  For  instance,  the  ECD\u2019s \nnotice-and-takedown  rules  continue  to  work  well  in  many  scenarios,  especially  where  the \nillegality  of content  is  not  apparent  on  its  face (e.g.,  in claims  of  copyright  infringement  or \ndefamation).  That  said,  the  variety  and  usage  of  online  services  has  expanded  dramatically \nsince the ECD was adopted, and it is not clear that the concept of \u201cstorage\u201d on which Article \n14\u2019s  notice-and-takedown  framework  rests  is  sufficiently  nuanced  to  account  for  this \ndiversity. As an example, while a cloud service provided to business customers, and a social \nmedia  service  offered  to  consumers,  both  involve  the  \u201cstorage\u201d  of  user content,  the  digital \nsafety  risks  they  pose\u2014and  users\u2019  expectations  about  how  providers  will  treat  their \ncontent\u2014vary substantially. Any new rules in this area should therefore preserve the general \napproach  of  the  ECD,  including  its  safe  harbours  and  country-of-origin  rules,  but  also \nincentivize  online  intermediaries  to  take  actions  appropriately  tailored  to  their  services  to \npromote digital safety among individual users, families and online communities.  ","795":"Promoting digital safety should not force providers to become censors. Obligations for \nservice  providers  to  promote  digital  safety  should  not  force  them  to  become  content \ngatekeepers. The ability of users to create, share, and access content directly is what makes \nthe  internet  so  dynamic  and  such  an  important  tool  for  promoting  fundamental  rights \nincluding  freedom  of  expression.  Although  digital  services  should  prioritize  operating  their \nservices in ways that limit digital safety risks, making them responsible for what their users \nsay, post, or link to would undermine how many services on the internet work and destroy \nthe internet\u2019s essence and value. Digital safety rules should also avoid incentivizing providers \nto over-censor content in order to limit potential liability. This risk is particularly acute where \nthe  rules  are  vague,  where  providers  must  assess  and  remove  content  under  tight  time \nconstraints, or where obligations vary between jurisdictions (since this may force providers to \napply the most restrictive content removal rules globally). ","796":" \n \n  \n \n \n\f\u2022  Nature of the service. Digital safety obligations should take into account the function of \nthe service, the relationship between providers and end-users, the expectations of users, \nand  the  risk  profile  of  the  service  itself.  For  example,  online  productivity  tools  tend  to \nhave lower risk of being used to spread illegal content virally than general-purpose social \nmedia  services,  while  a  corporate  customer  of  an  enterprise  cloud  service  will  have \ndifferent  expectations  than  a  consumer  who  publishes  content  on  a  social  messaging \nservice  that  is  accessible  by  the  general  public.  It  also  makes  sense  to  differentiate \nbetween  services  whose  primary  purpose  is  to  make  content  widely  available  to  the \npublic,  and  those  that  are  used  primarily  to  store  private  content  or  facilitate  private \ncommunications.  Even  for  consumer-facing  services,  the  fundamental  rights  impacts  of \nrequiring  providers  to  remove  content  may  vary  significantly  between  services  (e.g., \nsearch vs. a video-hosting service). ","797":"\u2022  Nature of the content. Content moderation rules should also be sensitive to the nature of \nthe  content.   For  instance,  content  removal  or  blocking  mandates  should  apply  only  to \ncontent that applicable law defines as illegal. Rules to address harmful but legal content \nshould  focus  instead  on  creating  incentives  for  service  providers  to  adopt  systems  and \nprocesses to minimize risks of harm to users, including by requiring providers to comply \nwith their own contractual digital safety commitments.  ","798":"\u2022  Nature of the illegality. Content moderation rules should also be tailored to the nature of \nthe content\u2019s illegality. For instance, certain types of content are universally agreed to be \nunlawful (e.g., child sexual exploitation and abuse material), while other types of content \nmight  be  illegal  in  one  context  and  not  another.  Where  lawfulness  or  harm  turns  on \ncontext,  or  the  illegality  of  content  is  not  apparent  on  its  face,  this  may  make  certain \ncontent  moderation  obligations  (e.g.,  automated  filtering)  less  appropriate  than  others \n(e.g., notice and takedown).  ","799":"Governments  should  provide  maximum  clarity.  Where  content  moderation  is  involved, \nthere  is  a  fine  line  between  protecting  users  from  illegal  content  and  censorship. \nPolicymakers, regulators, and courts\u2014not digital service providers\u2014must decide where this \nline should be drawn. To ensure appropriate respect for fundamental rights, the law must be \nclear  and  precise,  both  in  its  scope  and  the  obligations  it  imposes.  For  instance,  vague \ndefinitions of illegal hate speech could place a burden on technology companies to attempt \nto ascertain the intent of the speaker. This can be virtually impossible when providers have \nlittle or no context, and at a time where the meaning of specific words can change rapidly. \nAlso,  because  the  act  of  complying  with  virtually  any  content  moderation  obligation  will \nrequire providers to collect or process personal data, any rules in this area must clearly and \nexplicitly  reconcile  providers\u2019  digital  safety  requirements  with  the  privacy  and  other  legal \nobligations applicable to their unique services. ","800":"Rules should reward good-faith efforts to remove illegal or harmful content. Even the \nclearest rules by law or a provider\u2019s terms of service will require judgment calls on whether to \nremove content. To avoid the risk that providers, in seeking to limit their liability, are either \ntoo  aggressive  or  too  conservative  in  removing  content,  any  new  rules  should  protect ","801":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fproviders against liability for actions they undertake in good faith to comply with the law or \ntheir own terms of service\/community guidelines. This should include cases where a provider \nremoves content based on a good-faith belief that it falls within a removal order, or where \nthe  provider  does  not  remove  content  that  it  reasonably  believes  to  be  legal.  Where  a \nprovider reasonably and in good faith does more than the law requires, it should not thereby \nbe assumed to acquire \u201cknowledge\u201d of content that then subjects the provider to liability.   ","802":"\u2022  Microsoft supports the Commission\u2019s objective to ensure that its competition policy and rules are fit \nfor the digital age and are capable of levelling the playing field so that business will invest, innovate \nand grow.

","803":"\u2022  There is wide support for expansion of the competition policy tool kit as an effective way to address \nthese concerns, which reflects the strong reputation which the Commission\u2019s competition policy has \nearned over the years through clear policy objectives, a coherent and internally consistent analytical \nframework, its technocratic, non-political approach and its robust procedural safeguards.

","805":"\u2212  A sector-limited NCT would be less flexible, failing to capture structural competition problems in \nout-of-scope sectors; furthermore, a sectoral tool would raise the prospect of sterile disputes over \n\u2018jurisdiction\u2019 rather than to focus on substance. It would also be open to charges of discrimination \nby prejudging that structural competition problems are likely to exist in certain sectors. ","806":"\u2022  Microsoft  considers  that,  on  balance,  the  NCT  should  solely  address  competition  issues  to  the \nexclusion of consumer protection considerations. While, admittedly, the line between the two are not \nalways  easy  to  draw,  there  are  strong  arguments  for  a  competition-only  focus.  It  would  allow  the \nCommission to base the NCT on well-understood policy objectives and avoid more complex trade-offs ","807":"\u2022  The Commission will also need to make the sensitive decision of whether to address market failures \nstemming from legislation or regulation at either Member States or EU level. Given the objective of \nthe NCT to address \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d in full, Microsoft believes it would be appropriate \nfor the Commission to be able to address concerns regardless of whether they stem from private or \npublic conduct. ","808":"\u2022  The NCT would be more robust if the Commission were required to identify a plausible remedy at an \nearly stage of the investigation. There are two reasons why such a requirement would be justified: \nfirst, the potential benefits to intervention in terms of effectiveness of remedies must be sufficiently \nconcrete and likely to justify the significant costs of a market investigation (particularly in the absence \nof any deterrent effect); and, second, for the NCT, more than for other competition mechanism, it is \nthe  remedy  which  determines  the  relevant  counterfactual  without  which  a  clear  competition \nassessment will not be possible.  ","809":"\u2022  There would be a significant overlap between Option 3 of the NCT and the existing competition tools, \nin particular Articles 101 and 102. Microsoft believes there should be a priority rule for determining \nwhether  it  is  more  appropriate  to  address  the  issues  with  the  NCT  or  the  Commission\u2019s  existing \npowers. The  UK\u2019s  market  investigation  regime  (which  has  obvious  similarities  with  Option  3  of  the \nNCT) provides a good basis for such a priority rule, namely that the NCT should only address problems \nwithin the scope of its conventional competition tools where (a) it has \u2018reasonable grounds to suspect\u2019 \nthat  there  are  \u2018features\u2019  of  a  market  distorting  competition  but  does  not  have  sufficient  grounds  to \nestablish a breach of its conventional competition tools or (b) action under its conventional competition \ntools \u2018is likely to be ineffective.\u20192 ","810":"\u2022  One of the most difficult issues will be the legal standard for the NCT. In Microsoft\u2019s view, the NCT \nshould apply a legal standard for intervention which is consistent with EU competition policy and, in \nparticular,  the  Commission\u2019s  existing  competition  policy  instruments. A  lowering  of  standards  away \nfrom  precedent  would  unjustifiably  disregard  the  Commission\u2019s  and  the  EU  Courts\u2019  decades  of \nexperience and accumulated practice on the appropriate treatment of different types of conduct and \nmarket features. This calculus does not change materially due to the absence of fines or infringement \ndecisions.3  The  standards  set  under Article  101  and  102  TFEU  focus  primarily  on  the  costs  and \nbenefits of intervention without consideration for whether a fine will ultimately be imposed.4 ","811":"\u2022  Procedural  safeguards  are  a  necessary  consequence  of  any  creation  of  novel  regulatory  powers. \nAgain, inspiration can be drawn from the UK market investigation regime which has an elaborate set \nof procedural safeguards to ensure due process for these wide-ranging investigations, including (i) a \ntwo-phase  process,  where  a  Phase  I  market  study  may  lead  to  an  in-depth  (Phase  II)  market \ninvestigation; (ii) a strict legal test for opening a Phase II investigation which is a protection mechanism \nagainst \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d, i.e. lengthy investigations being launched without a clearly defined theory ","812":"\u2022  The final safeguard, and perhaps one of the most important for the legitimacy of the NCT relates to \nthe right of judicial review: the substantive legal tests for the NCT must be sufficiently clear and precise \nto enable affected companies to challenge the Commission\u2019s findings; and the scope and intensity of \nthe review of the EU courts, in terms of merits, should be no less than what is accorded in relation to \nthe existing competition tools. ","813":"The proposal to introduce an NCT is part of the Commission\u2019s answer to the challenge that competition \npolicy has increasingly fallen short. The claim is made that the competition agencies have been \u201casleep at \nthe wheel\u201d in recent years but also that the existing competition policy tools lack sufficient scope, flexibility, \nspeed and powers to tackle today\u2019s competition problems, particularly in the digital sector. This discussion \nis part of a far wider debate over the ability of the modern economy to deliver the best outcomes for society.  ","814":"Microsoft  recognises  that  the  underlying  market  characteristics  and  dynamics  that  accompany  digital \ntransformation, which bring manifold benefits, at times create legitimate competition concerns which may \nbe best addressed outside the context of traditional competition enforcement. While some of the additional \nburden of addressing those concerns will fall on ex ante regulation, there is strong support by many policy \nmakers and commentators to rely heavily on competition policy and to expand the scope of its existing tool \nkit.  ","815":"This support reflects the good reputation which competition policy (both at a global but in particular at the \nEU  level)  enjoys,  despite  its  occasional  shortcomings.  This  reputation  was  forged  as  a  result  of  its \nconversion  towards  clear  policy  objectives;  its  coherent  and  internally  consistent  substantive  analytic \nframework; and its technocratic, non-political approach which is supported by clear procedural safeguards. \nThe clarity of the competition policy framework, and of the economic theories underpinning it, support a \nconsistent  legal  framework  for  enforcement  across  a  variety  of  different  market  structures  and  market \ncharacteristics. Furthermore, competition rules have been capable of adapting and changing over time to \nkeep pace with innovation and changes in business practices, as well as preserving political legitimacy. ","816":"The introduction of the NCT would mark a policy choice to widen the role of competition policy to address \nperceived failings and enforcement \u201cgaps\u201d through a hybridized instrument. In so doing, it will inevitably blur \nthe line between competition policy and wider regulatory policy. The Commission would step from enforcing \nthe law to managing a broader regulatory remit. While this does not automatically undermine the existing \ntenets of EU competition policy, the wider regulatory remit of the NCT \u2013 with more complex trade-offs \u2013 will \ninevitably put pressure on them.  ","817":"Microsoft  sees  a  case  for  the  introduction  of  the  NCT  to  address  the  gaps  in  existing  enforcement;  the \nchallenge for the Commission will be to make sure that it does not throw out the baby with the bathwater: \npreserving  the  benefits  of  competition  policy  built  up  over  decades  whilst  equipping  the  Commission  to \naddress the legitimate concerns raised in recent years as to the effectiveness of Commission\u2019s competition \npowers.  ","818":" \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\u2022  Substantive  safeguards:  Firstly,  the  NCT  must  be  in  line  with  the  existing  competition  policy \nobjectives; second, the NCT must clearly identify the gaps in existing enforcement which it seeks to \naddress and the standard for intervention must be tailored precisely to address those gaps, rather \nthan granting broad discretion to intervene which supplants effective existing enforcement.   ","819":"The  four  policy  options  offered  by  the  Commission  in  the  Consultation  Process  are  defined  along  two \ndimensions: (i) policy reach: a narrow dominance-based tool versus a wide market-structure tool; and (ii) \nindustry reach: a narrow tool for digital markets versus a wide tool which is universally applicable across all \nindustries.  ","820":"If, however, the Commission concludes there is an insufficient regulatory gap to justify the introduction of a \nmarket structure-based tool, Microsoft believes that reform of Article 102 TFEU would be more appropriate \nthan introduction of a purely dominance-based NCT. This would enhance legal certainty by ensuring that a \nconsistent,  single  standard  for  intervention  applied  to  dominant  firms  while  not  destabilizing  the \nCommission\u2019s existing competition instruments by introducing new powers in parallel.  ","821":"A  sector-limited  NCT  would  be  less  flexible,  failing  to  capture  structural  competition  problems  in  out-of-\nscope  sectors.  While  the  market  failures  particularly  associated  with  digital  markets  such  as  strong \neconomies of scale and network effects may be more prevalent in the platform economy, these issues are \nnot novel and go beyond the digital sector. Decades on, the VHS-Betamax \u201cformat wars\u201d remain a textbook \nexample of how significant network effects can cause a market to \u201ctip\u201d to VHS even in the \u201canalog\u201d world.5 \nThere  are  also  examples  of  network  effects  and  tipping  in  markets  ranging  from  financial  infrastructure \nthrough to payment systems and telecommunications.  ","822":"Furthermore, a sectoral-only tool raises the prospect of sterile disputes over \u201cjurisdiction\u201d rather than focus \non substance. As the impact of digitalization spreads, the line between markets that are and are not digital \nis likely to become difficult to discern and arguably less relevant. When, for example, would the payment \nsystem  sector  be  sufficiently  digitized  for  the  NCT  to  apply  and  would  it  then  only  apply  to  the  digital \nchallengers or also to the (non-digital) incumbents? And the NCT would risk becoming redundant or only of \nnarrow relevance as technology and industry advances if it is too narrowly drawn. ","823":"A sectoral-only tool would, finally, also be open to charges of discrimination by prejudging that structural \ncompetition problems are likely to exist in certain sectors. If it is necessary to limit the scope of the NCT to \nsectors \u201cprone\u201d to certain issues, one could infer that these issues cannot be easily identified on a case-by-\ncase basis, and that it may be more appropriate to rely on ex-ante sectoral regulation. ","824":"While  Option  3  has  the  advantages  of  a  wide  reach  and  will  potentially  capture  many,  if  not  all,  of  the \ncompetition concerns which cannot be addressed effectively with the existing Article 101\/102 tool kit, it also \nraises the question of what should be the outer limits of the NCT. This has two key dimensions:  ","825":"Management Strategy. On the significance of those network effects, Ohashi considered that with a minor \nstrategic adjustment the market could have just as easily tipped in the other direction: \u201cif Sony, the system \nsponsor of Beta, had aggressively introduced its VCRs at the early stage of competition, Beta would likely have \ndominated the market in 1985; instead, the format disappeared in 1989.\u201d ","826":"To put this into context, it is instructive to look to the Market Investigation Regime (\u201cMIR\u201d) in the UK \u2013 which \non the surface \u2013 has potential similarities with Option 3 set out by the Commission. Under the MIR, the \nCMA can address market failures stemming from both competition and consumer policy as well as those \nstemming from the public as well as the private domain. In the first instance, the CMA has reviewed both \nconventional  competition  issues  (e.g.  exclusionary  conduct  by  dominant  firms,  see  BSkyB  Market \nInvestigation (2012)) and unconventional competition policy (e.g. exploitative conduct by dominant firms, \nsee BAA Market Investigation (2009).6 The CMA has, however, also reviewed issues that stem from issues \nof consumer policy (e.g. exploitative conduct where a proportion of customers do not switch due to inertia \nUK Energy Market Investigation (2016)).7 In the second instance, the CMA has also identified where UK \nregulation or legislation is hampering the effective operation of markets and put forward recommendations \nfor legislative and regulatory reform (e.g. UK Energy Market Investigation).  ","827":"The distinction between competition policy and consumer policy is encapsulated in the question of whether \nthe NCT should solely protect the integrity of the market mechanism by intervening where necessary to \nensure \u201ceffective\u201d competition takes place (competition policy) or whether it should also intervene to pursue \nwider issues of consumer policy (e.g. fair distribution of the benefits of competitive process). If the former \nholds, the NCT would only address structural competition problems that stem from the supply side (e.g. \nwhere firms have sought to restrict multi-homing). If the latter holds, the NCT would also address structural \n\u201ccompetition\u201d problems stemming from the demand side  (e.g. where consumer inertia  means that some \ncustomers do not stimulate and do not benefit from the competitive process).8 That said, the line between \ncompetition policy and consumer policy is not  always clear cut: firms may adapt practices which  exploit \nconsumer behavior. Such practices can however be addressed as part of extended competition policy (e.g. \nwhere firms tacitly collude).   ","828":"The UK\u2019s market  investigation regime  illustrates the complexity of trade-offs between competition policy \nand consumer  policy. For example, the CMA\u2019s energy market investigation, saw the CMA balancing the \nprotection of passive consumers\u2019 interests against the long-term concern that intervention would undermine \nthe competitive  process (by disincentivizing consumers from driving competition).9 In deciding against  a \nbroader  price  cap  the  CMA  noted  that  \u201cthere  were  material  risks  of  adverse  consequences  from  the \nintroduction of a price cap for a large number of customers which outweighed the short-term reduction of \ndetriment\u201d but that the dissenting opinion of one panelist represented a \u201cdifference in view [which] reflects, \nin part, members\u2019 respective judgements on the likelihood that better outcomes will be delivered through \ncompetitive markets with more engaged customers over the next few years.\u201d10 Such differences of opinion \nhighlight that these issues require circumspection as well as an ability to make complex policy trade-offs \nand public value judgments which pure competition authorities are typically ill-suited to make. ","829":"Second, the Commission will need to make the sensitive decision of whether to address market failures \nstemming from legislation or regulation at either the Member State or EU level. Microsoft observes that the \nTreaties already provide \u2013 to a limited degree \u2013 such powers. So-called \u201cgap filling\u201d means that national \nlegislation and regulation which axiomatically leads to an infringement of Article 101 TFEU or Article 102 \nTFEU  is  prohibited.11  Furthermore,  given  the  objective  of  the  NCT  to  address  \u201cstructural  competition \nproblems\u201d in full, it would be appropriate for the Commission to be able to address concerns regardless of \nwhether they stem from private or public conduct. ","830":"Microsoft strongly suggests that the NCT would be more robust if the Commission is required to identify a \nplausible remedy at an early stage of the investigation. There are two reasons why such an obligation is \njustified: first, the potential benefits to intervention in terms of effectiveness of remedies must be sufficiently \nconcrete and likely to justify the significant costs of a market investigation (particularly in the absence of \nany deterrent effect); and, second, for the NCT, more than for other competition mechanism, it is the remedy \nwhich determines the relevant counterfactual. In other words, the remedy considerations are not a separate \nworkstream  following  the  competition  assessment,  they  are  an  integral  part  thereof,  setting  the  overall \nframework in which the analysis takes place.  ","831":"The Commission\u2019s existing powers require the identification of an anti-competitive act (e.g. an agreement \nor  unilateral  conduct)  which,  in  turn,  typically  gives  a  straightforward  remedy:  prohibition  of  the  relevant \nagreement  or  conduct.  Only  in  limited  circumstances  do  the  Commission\u2019s  existing  powers  require \nmandatory remedies (e.g. abusive refusal to supply requires the Commission to mandate access). This, in \nturn,  means  that  the  costs  of  intervention  and  the  likely  availability  of  remedies  should  be  (relatively) \nstraightforward: the Commission need only evaluate the costs and ability to reverse the anti-competitive \nact.   ","832":"In  contrast,  the  NCT  would  have  a  significantly  wider  scope  and  thus  a  universe  of  potential  structural \nproblems. And while the NCT may in theory be capable of identifying a large number of market imperfections \nand resulting concerns, not all of them can be effectively remedied nor are the countervailing costs of such \nremedies  straightforward.  To  illustrate  this,  one  of  the  Commission\u2019s  key  concerns  is  maintaining \ncompetitive  pressure  on  market  \u201cgatekeepers\u201d  and  ensuring  that  markets  do  not  unduly  \u201ctip\u201d  towards  a \nsingle platform. There are a range of theoretical remedies for such concerns: e.g. facilitating multi-homing. \nThese remedies carry, however, different costs (e.g. the differing  disincentive effects on investment from \nsuch interventions) and may be more or less feasible depending on the circumstances.12  ","833":"A requirement to identify a plausible remedy at an early stage would thus ensure that the costs of an in-\ndepth  investigation  would  only  be  expended  if  there  is  a  reasonable  prospect  of  any  concern  (should  it \nexist)  being  capable  of  being  remedied  (without  the  cost  outweighing  the  benefits  of  intervention). This \napproach would be consistent with the UK market investigation regime which provides that the CMA should, \ninter alia, only consider launching a market investigation where (i) the scale of the suspected problem, in \nterms of its adverse effect on competition, is such that a reference would be an appropriate response; and \n(ii) \u2018there is a reasonable chance that appropriate remedies will be available.\u201913 This can also be seen in \npractice. For example, the CMA opted not to take refer Online Platforms and Digital Advertising (2020) for \na market  investigation despite having identified  prima facie concerns because the CMA  did not,  in part, \nhave suitable remedial powers to address the relevant issues.14  ","834":"In  the  case  of  a  merger  control  and  the  control  of  restrictive  agreements,  the  identification  of  the \ncounterfactual is relatively straightforward: For merger control, this is a world in the absence of the merger \nwhich  in  most  (but  not  all)  circumstances  means  the  continuation  of  the  status  quo;  for  restrictive \nagreements, the counterfactual is the world without the restriction or, if the restriction is ancillary the world ","835":" \n \n \n \n \n \n\fwithout  the  agreement.  Because  the  factual  and  counterfactual  are  obvious  in  these  instances,  the \ncompetitive analysis and the remedy considerations often appear separate from each other.15 This however \nis not always the case. Some abuse of dominance cases, where the situation is more complex, provides \nan  illustration:  while  it  still  holds  true  that  the  counterfactual  is  a  world  without  abuse,  the  nature  of  the \nabuse is defined by the remedy. A remedy which imposes an obligation to sell products separately means \nthat the abuse was a tying abuse; by contrast, a \u201cmust carry\u201d remedy (mandatory remedy) implies that the \ndominant  firm  has  committed  an  unlawful  refusal  to  supply.  Both  remedies  lead  to  very  different \ncounterfactuals, namely a  world  in which products will be sold separately (in  the case of  an  unbundling \nscenarios) versus a world in which the dominant players and its competitors bundle their products together \nwith the dominant product.   ","836":"In the case of the NCT, the competitive analysis and the remedy are even more intertwined through the \ncounterfactual. Contrary to the other competition instruments, there exists no anticompetitive act (whether \nanticompetitive  merger,  restrictive  agreement  or  abusive  behavior)  and  hence  there  is  no  \u201cnatural \ncounterfactual\u201d; merely a list of potentially problematic market features and an even greater list of potential \nremedies to address the problematic features. For an NCT investigation, the factual is the status quo, i.e. \nthe  world  as  we  know  it,  and  the  counterfactual  is  the  world  with  whatever  remedy  or  remedies  the \nCommission may wish to impose.  ","837":"For example, where the problem is perceived as a lack of interoperability is the appropriate counterfactual \na  scenario  where  partial  or  full  interoperability  is  permitted  and  are  all  firms  or  only  the  dominant  firm \ndeemed to be providing interoperability? Equally, in the context of the MIR, the Competition Commission \nfound,  inter  alia,  a  lack  of  competition  for  airports  around  London  due  to  BAA\u2019s  dominant  position  for \noperating such airports and required BAA to divest Gatwick and Stansted (while keeping Heathrow).16 The \ncounterfactual was thus defined by the divestment obligation as this set the counterfactual for evaluating \nthe costs and benefits of intervention.

The analytical framework between merger control, control \nof restrictive agreements and abuse of dominance has converged, and competition law has been adapted \nand applied  in a consistent yet  effective way in  new  markets.

Second,  consistency  avoids  \u201cregulatory \narbitrage\u201d by the Commission; there is no temptation to characterize an arrangement in a particular way in \norder to lower the burden for infringement.

However, under this type of regime, complex \nconsistency issues arise in relation to the identification and separation of the distinct problems that the tool \nis intended to address.

In theory, the \nlegal doctrine of lex specialis derogat legi generali (a special law derogates from a general law)  already \nprovides a basis of priority.

To be effective, the priority rule must clearly outline the type of cases \nwhere the NCT is more appropriate (e.g. where market-wide remedies are required).   ","846":"\u2022  A  move  away  from  precedent  would  unjustifiably  disregard  the  Commission\u2019s  and  the  EU  Courts\u2019 \ndecades of experience and accumulated practice on the appropriate treatment of different types of \nconduct  and  market  features.  EU  jurisprudence  applies,  for  example,  different  standards  for \nintervening where a dominant firm is engaging in exclusive dealing (effects- standard) and where a \ndominant  firm  is  refusing  to  deal  (indispensability-standard):  this  reflects  the  assessment  of  the \nrelative  merits  of  intervening  in  such  circumstances.21  If  the  NCT  is  intended  to  relax  existing \nrequirements under case  law, for  example, relating to the  essential facilities doctrine  or to  market \ndefinition in dominance cases, it would be better to address these issues directly in a way which is \nconsistent with the existing framework. Otherwise, the creation of an alternative standard may create \na regulatory incentive to use the NCT over the Commission\u2019s existing powers (or vice versa), which \nwould work to the detriment of legal certainty and deterrence value established under Articles 101 \nand 102 TFEU.

Nevertheless, in some instances, UK market investigations have focused on concerns that \nwould also fall within the scope of the CMA\u2019s conventional competition tools. For example, in Movies on Pay-TV, \nthe theory of harm was that access to movie content was a \u2018significant\u2019 factor in consumers selecting a pay-tv \nprovider and Sky\u2019s control meant that other pay-tv providers could not compete effectively. The theory of harm \nwas thus a de facto abuse case pursuant to Article 102 TFEU whereby Sky was allegedly refusing to supply or \ndegrading supply of an essential input. ","848":" \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\u2022  This calculus does not change materially due to the absence of fines or infringement decisions.22 The \nstandards  set  under  Article  101  and  102  TFEU  focus  primarily  on  the  costs  and  benefits  of \nintervention without consideration for whether a fine will ultimately be imposed.23 Furthermore, Article \n101 and Article 102 TFEU  are flexible instruments that permit both commitment  decisions (i.e.  no \ninfringement and no fine) and infringement decisions without a fine. As such, the fact that the NCT \nwould not involve an infringement decision should not affect the standard set for intervention under \nthe NCT. ","849":"Moreover,  an  approach  consistent  with  existing  precedent  would  not  undermine  the  aim  of  the  NCT  to \npermit earlier intervention. It is possible to achieve this goal by creating rules which are complementary to \nrather than conflicting with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU while expanding the scope of the NCT to address \nconduct and market features (allowing intervention so that markets can \u201cself-right\u201d by improving the market \nmechanism).  ","850":"On the other hand,  even where the NCT  is addressing issues outside the scope of the  existing rules, it \nremains important that similar standard for intervention is applied. This is to ensure the coherency of EU \ncompetition policy. The NCT is, for example, expected to address structural competition problems stemming \nfrom unilateral conduct of non-dominant firms (e.g. in relation to limitations on multi-homing). Such conduct \nis \u2013 rightfully \u2013 presumed to be less likely to harm competition than conduct by dominant firms. It would be \nparadoxical then if the NCT were to apply a lower standard of intervention to such conduct that Article 102 \nTFEU  applies  to  unilateral  conduct  by  dominant  firms.  More  practically,  it  would  also  create  a  perverse \nregulatory incentive to prioritize investigations of conduct which in principle is less likely to be harmful due \nto the lower standard for intervention (and thus the greater ease for successfully intervening).  ","851":"Ensuring consistency \u2013 in principle \u2013 with the Commission\u2019s remedial powers for Article 101 and Article 102 \nTFEU would not unduly hamper the NCT. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s existing remedial powers provide, in \nprinciple,  the  ability  to  impose  any  form  of  structural  or  behavioral  remedy  on  private  actors.  Under \nRegulation 1\/2003, the Commission is entitled to impose \u2018any behavioural or structural remedies which are \nproportionate to the infringement committed and necessary to bring the infringement effectively to an end.\u201925 \nWhile the market structure-based tool would cover a significantly wider range of issues and thus inevitably \na wider set of regulatory solutions, the Commission\u2019s existing powers already provide significant flexibility. \nThere is thus no need to expand or loosen the Commission\u2019s already significant remedial powers under \ncompetition policy. ","852":"Microsoft believes, however, that the Commission\u2019s powers under the NCT should be limited to ending the \nstructural competition problem or the cause of a structural competition problem \u2013 but not the effects of that \nproblem.  In  other  words,  the  Commission\u2019s  remedial  powers  should  be  restricted  to  improving  the \ncompetitive process.

","854":"As  outlined  in  our  response  to  the  inception  impact  assessment,  Microsoft  does  not  believe  that  a \ndominance-based  tool  would  be  suitable  to  address  the  full  scope  of  the  concerns  outlined  by  the \nCommission. Furthermore, Microsoft also notes that a dominance-based competition tool would also give \nrise to an obvious and inherent issue of consistency.  ","855":"In simple terms, the NCT would become an instrument to circumvent the higher standard imposed by Article \n102 TFEU  (in  at  least  certain  circumstances). This  can  be  inferred  from  the  IIA  which  provides  that  the \ndominance-based  tool  is  intended  to  enable  intervention  \u2018before  a  dominant  company  successfully \nforecloses competitors or raises their costs\u2019. The overlap between Article 102 TFEU and the new tool is \nthus  part  and  parcel  of  the  objective  of  enabling  earlier  intervention.  However,  the  corollary  to  \u201cearly \nintervention\u201d is that the NCT will carry a lower standard than Article 102 TFEU in order to permit intervention \nwhere establishing the elements of an abuse under Article 102 TFEU presents too high a bar. Otherwise, \nthe  Commission  would have two  instruments (the NCT and Article  102 TFEU) that  largely achieved the \nsame policy objectives.  ","856":"While a lower standard may of course be merited (delayed intervention may, for example, not be sufficient \nto preserve effective competition  in some (fast-moving) markets), the Commission\u2019s proposal  this would \nresult in conflicting legal standards which pursue similar objectives for the same conduct, creating a strong \nregulatory incentive to bring cases under the new tool wherever possible. This would render nugatory the \ndeterrence value of Article  102 TFEU, essentially reducing  its practical scope to cases where harm has \nalready occurred, and  no remedial action is necessary or possible.  Where it is seeking remedies rather \nthan an infringement decision, the Commission will have little incentive to pursue the higher standard under \nthe traditional route given the likelihood that the NCT will carry enhanced remedies powers.  ","857":"As set out above, Microsoft thus considers reform to Article 102 TFEU the more appropriate solution as it \navoids having two conflicting instruments to address the same conduct. More specifically, given that the \nCommission\u2019s principal charge seems to be the lack of administrative flexibility to intervene early in cases, \nreform and expansion to the \u201cinterim measures\u201d regime may be an alternative route to achieve the desired \npurpose.  ","858":"Procedural  safeguards  are  key  for  maintaining  the  objective  and  transparent  application  of  competition \npolicy  (and  ultimately  for  maintaining  support  for  the  system).  Procedural  safeguards  should  be \nproportionate to the restriction of rights that the new powers entail and the costs which result from their \nexercise. In particular, these must ensure that the rights of defense of the affected parties are protected \nand that the process cannot be abused for political reasons or otherwise misused.  ","859":"Microsoft believes that the NCT investigative process should be subject to a two-stage process. The first \nphase should be concerned with establishing whether a prima facie structural competition problem exists \nand whether it can be remedied under the NCT, and the second phase should be primarily concerned with \ndetermining which (if any) remedies are appropriate and proportionate.  ","860":"The separation of these processes is appropriate for a few reasons. First, the two issues will be subject to \nseparate  substantive  assessments  which  will  require  differing  levels  of  information  gathering  and  rigor. \nSecond, the possibility of remedies will require affected parties to incur significant additional costs in order \nto ensure fair treatment. Third, the Phase I \/ Phase II model has the advantage of being well known in the \ncontext of existing EU competition law procedure, for example in the context of the EU merger regulation. ","861":"Furthermore, Microsoft considers that the proper implementation of a two-stage NCT process would require \nthe Commission\u2019s Sector Inquiry tool either to be discarded, or for its use to time-bar the opening of an NCT \ninvestigation. This will be necessary to avoid the Sector Inquiry tool being used as the de facto \u201cPhase 0\u201d \nor \u201cprenotification phase\u201d of the NCT.  ","862":"Phase II investigations will generate significant costs, both administratively and for the market participants \ninvolved. As such, they should not be used as a tool for the Commission to engage in \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d \nwhere lengthy investigations are launched without a clearly defined theory of harm and without plausible \nremedies in prospect.26  ","863":"The Commission may currently open a sector inquiry where it considers that a market is not working as \nwell as it should and where breaches of competition rules may be a contributory factor. The Commission \nmay consider a similar test for the opening of a Phase I NCT investigation, adjusted to reflect a concern of \n\u201cstructural  competition  problems\u201d.  However,  stricter  legal  test  for  Phase  II  is  necessary  because  of  the \nsignificant  additional  costs  associated  with  the  NCT\u2019s  remedial  powers.  This  rationale  is  line  with  the \nexperience  in  the  UK  market  investigation  regime  where  over  time  the  (preliminary)  market  study  has \ndeveloped into a Phase I investigation which may (or may not) lead to a market investigation reference (de \nfacto, an in-depth investigation) if the requisite legal test is satisfied.  ","864":"The  threat  of  market-wide  remedies  will  effectively  force  companies  subject  to  an  NCT  investigation  to \ninvest  significant  resources  to  make  their  case  why  significant  remedial  intervention  is  unnecessary. \nMicrosoft therefore submits that the legal test should require the Commission to outline potential remedies, \nboth to ensure that there are plausible remedies in contemplation (as discussed under section C) but also ","865":"and under Article 41(2)c) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The obligation to give \nreasons is specific to the legal basis of the action and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the \nreasoning leading to the adoption of the decision so as to enable an affected party to challenge the decision by \njudicial review. ","866":"Under the UK market investigation regime, there is a division of powers between the decision to refer a \nmarket investigation and the market investigation itself. This used to be split between the Office for Fair \nTrading and the Competition Commission respectively, but even upon the on the creation of the CMA, the \nsplit was maintained, with the first decision taken by the CMA Board, and the market investigation run by \nindependent  decision  makers.  No  overlap  of  personnel  between  the  two  is  allowed.  The  market \ninvestigation is therefore a new independent investigation which looks at the market with a \u201cfresh pair of \neyes\u201d.27 ","867":"The administrative model of antitrust in the EU has sometimes been criticized given the Commission\u2019s role \nas \u201cjudge, jury and executioner\u201d of antitrust cases.28 While this criticism has been levied in the context of \nthe application of pure antitrust rules, where relatively consistent legal tests have been developed, Microsoft \nconsiders that there is an even greater need for a \u201cfresh pair of eyes\u201d when considering new types of issues \n(e.g.  \u201csuboptimal\u201d  market  structures)  under  the  NCT,  for  which  consistent  legal  tests  may  take  time  to \ndevelop.  ","868":"That  said,  while  the  panel  model  is  compatible  with  the  UK  competition  system  with  its  long  history  of \ninstitutional separation (stemming from the previous split between the OFT and Competition Commission) \n\u2013 it would be somewhat alien to  EU competition  law.  Over the years, the  Commission has developed  a \nnumber of procedural safeguards which in some cases, have not had the full desired effect. In particular, \nthe oral hearing procedure has previously been criticized by the OECD which noted among other things \nthat neither the ultimate decision-maker \u2013 the College \u2013 nor the Competition Commissioner were required \nto  attend  the  oral  hearing.29  The  NCT  may  present  an  opportunity  to  reinvigorate  existing  procedural \nsafeguards,  or  develop  new  safeguards,  in  the  context  of  a  new  process,  which  if  successful,  could  be \ntranslated into existing merger control and antitrust procedures. For example, in the context of the current \nEU competition law procedure, the oral hearing comes at a relatively advanced stage in the antitrust and \nmerger control procedure which arguably reduces its effectiveness as a procedural safeguard. Indeed, the \nlimited perception of effectiveness of the oral hearing as a right of defense is highlighted by the fact that \nmany affected parties decline the option to attend a formal  oral  hearing.  Instead, Microsoft submits that \ngiven the significant cost associated with market investigations, the Commission should take the opportunity \nto strengthen the oral hearing procedure, which could instead be used at an earlier stage to decide whether \nor not to open a Phase II investigation, involving key decision makers at that point in the process. ","869":"Microsoft considers that the legal tests in NCT investigations should be bound by strict deadlines by which \nit  must  conclude  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  of  its  review.  This  follows  the  approach  from  the  UK\u2019s  market \ninvestigation regime, where the CMA must conclude a market study (de facto Phase I) within 12 months \nand must then conclude any market investigation (de facto Phase II) within 18 months from the date that \nthe reference is made (extendable by six months exceptionally). ","870":"Given the potentially burdensome nature of an investigation (particularly where the firms are not alleged to \nhave infringed competition law), it is important that Commission\u2019s powers of investigation  under the NCT \ndo not result in drawn-out investigations (with their deleterious effects on the businesses under scrutiny). A \ntime-limit will also help to ensure a focused nature to the investigation, ensuring that potential remedies are \nconsidered (and market tested) at an early stage, promoting efficient use of public and private resources. \nMoreover, in addition to avoiding the additional procedural costs of lengthy investigations, a time-limit on \nthe  market  investigation also has the  benefit of supporting the rationales that the NCT should allow the \nCommission to intervene before consumer harm has occurred (or worsened).   ","871":"Firstly, Microsoft submits that the NCT should impose a general time limit for the conclusion of a Phase I \ninvestigation (and the decision whether to open a Phase II investigation), as well as a final deadline for the \nconclusion  of  Phase  II  investigations  by  which  point  the  substantive  findings  must  be  made  and  the \nremedies  (if  any)  imposed.  This  approach  would  be  broadly  in  line  with  the  UK\u2019s  market  investigation \nregime. The Commission may also consider shorter timelines for remedies that are recommendations to \ngovernments\/public  bodies  and  longer  timelines  for  actual  orders  to  undertakings  (given  the  need  for \nadditional scrutiny).  ","872":"Secondly, the Microsoft submits that the NCT must have appropriate safeguards to prevent circumvention \nof the timing safeguard. In particular, as outlined above, unless it is integrated into the time limits as \u201cPhase \nI\u201d of the NCT process, the Commission should not be able to use a sector inquiry to de facto conduct a pre-\nNCT  investigation.  Equally,  the  Commission  should  not  be  able  to  abandon  an  NCT  investigation  and \nrestarting  anew to circumvent the time limits. As such, opening a new NCT investigation  must therefore \ncreate a time-bar on the opening of another NCT investigation addressing the same issue or market. Finally, \nunlike merger cases, the parties affected by the investigation are unlikely to have incentives aligned to have \nthe investigation concluded in a timely manner. Without a strict time limit on the Commission\u2019s side, and \nincentives for market participants to respond to information requests in a timely manner, NCT investigations \nare likely to incur significant delays which would undermine the effectiveness of the tool.  ","873":" \n \n \n \n \n\fcompetition problems, but also to challenge the suitability and the proportionality of the imposed remedies. \nThis means that the appropriate legal test for the imposition of remedies should be linked to the nature of \nthe remedy (e.g. different standards for structural versus behavioral remedies). Otherwise, the Commission \nwould have free reign to impose any remedy it desires once it establishes a structural competition problem. \nMicrosoft therefore submits that separate, judiciable tests for remedies of different nature will be necessary \nfor the EU Courts to safeguard the rights of defense and represent an effective check on the Commission\u2019s \npower.  ","874":"Aside from unlimited jurisdiction on fines, the judicial review of the legality of competition decisions is limited \nin scope, as the General Court is not entitled to substitute in its own judgment for that of the Commission. \nHowever, the intensity and thoroughness of this legality review requires the General Court to scrutinize in \npainstaking  detail  the  robustness  of  the  Commission\u2019s  conclusions.  This  has  been  demonstrated  on  a \nnumber of occasions, most recently in CK Telecoms UK v Commission, where the General Court annulled \nthe  Commission\u2019s  decision  to  prohibit  the  merger  between  Three  and  O2  in  the  UK,  finding  that  the \nCommission\u2019s theories of harm were too vague did not demonstrate a \u201cstrong probability\u201d of the existence \nof significant impediments to effective competition.30  ","875":"Microsoft submits that the NCT should be subject to the same high intensity of judicial review as for other \ncompetition decisions, regardless of whether the NCT does not provide for  fines or infringements. It has \nbeen consistently held in this regard, in both merger31 and antitrust32 cases, that the Commission\u2019s margin \nof appreciation in economic matters should be limited by the Court to ensure that \u201cthe evidence put forward \nis factually accurate, reliable and consistent but must also determine whether that evidence contains all the \nrelevant  data  that  must  be  taken  into  consideration  in  appraising  a  complex  situation  and  whether  it  is \ncapable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it\u201d. Indeed, the intensity of the General Court\u2019s review \nof the legality of Commission decisions does not notably vary between  quasi-criminal antitrust decisions \nand merger decisions (which similar to the NCT, have no fines or infringements attached).33   ","876":"Moreover, it would be harmful to afford the Commission a greater level of discretion in NCT investigations \nthan it has in respect of other areas of competition law. Firstly, given the broad scope of (Option 3) of the \nNCT, and more importantly its broad remedial powers, it would be counterintuitive to have less scrutiny of \nCommission decisions given the significant potential impact on private interests.

","880":"The  advent  of  Big  Data  and  the  consequent  widespread  use  of  BI&A  systems  have \nencouraged numerous shipping lines to revise their commercial strategies and turn to global \nend-to-end  services.1  The  use  of  the  BI&A  systems  will  allow  for  the  control  of  the  entire \nlogistics  chain  of  these  services  and,  where  possible,  will  protect  these  systems  and  their \nimprovements  by  IP  rights.  For  this  same  purpose,  Maersk  and  IBM  have  entered  a  joint \nventure creating TradeLens, a company owned 51% by Maersk and 49% by IBM. ","881":"At the moment, apart from COSCO-OOCL, all major container lines that are involved in one \nof the three global alliances are members of the DCSA, thus representing 70% of the global \nmarket. Furthermore, as all DCSA members support TradeLens, this means that the DSCA \nstandards have become signatory for the industry.  ","882":"Antitrust  concerns  may  emerge  from  the  need  for  these  new  actors  to  have  access  to  the \ntechnical data underlying the DCSA standards in order to be able to research and develop \nnew  standards.  Particularly  if  the  DCSA  standards  are  protected  by  IP-rights,  lines  may \nimpose royalties or licensing terms. This behaviour may have severe antitrust implications \nthat could be fostered in a situation where DCSA standards cover topics outside the \nlegitimate standard-setting activity. ","883":"These developments have a huge impact on the proper assessment of antitrust issues on this \nmarket,  particularly  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  scope:  the  market  has  undeniably  become  a \nglobal  market;  (ii)  structure:  the  ever-increasing  use  of  the  digital  technology  and  the \nestablishment of companies like TradeLens which gather (iii) dominance: the majority of the \nbig carriers. ","884":"The tools the Commission currently possesses for measuring, evaluating and neutralizing anti-\ncompetitive conduct were formulated in an era when Big Data and BI&A systems were still a \nvision for the future. These tools are far from adequate and effective for dealing with antitrust \nconcerns in relation with these developments.  ","885":"Some  of  these  concerns  were  raised  in  the  framework  of  the  consultation  regarding  the \nConsortia  BER  for  liner  shipping2  and  it  was  stressed  upon  the  fact  that  digitalization, \nglobalization and concentration in the container shipping may lead to anti-competitive effects \ndue  to the  fact  that  the  provisions  of  the  Consortia  BER  are  lacking  clarity  about  do\u2019s  and \ndon\u2019ts with respect to the exchange of information and that more and more container shipping \nlines  are  offering  door  to  door  services  and  using  of  Big  Data  and  BI&A  systems  to  their \nadvantage.  ","886":"The absence of tools that are sufficiently adequate and effective for enabling EU and national \nantitrust authorities to measure, evaluate and neutralize the anticompetitive effects that may \nderive  from  the  above  mentioned  evolution  in  the  containerized  sector  is  becoming  a  real \nthreat  for  a  number  of  actors  which  compete  with  shipping  lines  on  a  number  of  land  and \nlogistics related services. ","887":"The \u201chard core\u201d prohibition of the fixing of prices when selling liner shipping services to third \nparties  laid  down  in  the  Consortia  BER  only  refers  to  arrangements  that  have  this  as  their \nobject. Pursuant to the established case law of the ECJ, the circumstances surrounding its \nattainment  may  also  be  used  in  interpreting  the  wording  of  arrangements  for  those  areas, \nwhich are unclear.  As a result, not only the fixing of prices but also price recommendations \nand tariff impositions, by any per person on transport users, fall within the scope of the \u201chard \ncore\u201d prohibition of the consortia BER, provided they have a similar anticompetitive impact. ","888":"Arrangements that do not have a restriction on competition as their object may also be caught \nby the prohibition on cartels because they have it as their effect. This effect does not need to \nhave  actually  occurred.  It  is  sufficient  for  it  to  appear  likely  in the  near  future.  This  second ","889":"The  competition-limiting  effect  of  an  arrangement  may  be  the  result  of  it  alone  or  of  the \ninteraction  between  it  and  the  accompanying  economic  circumstances.  Special  importance \nmay, in particular, be attached to the fact that an agreement is part of a network of similar \nagreements that the party has also completed with other undertakings and the fact that the \nmarket  contains  other  networks  of  agreements  which  have  been  build  up  by  other \nundertakings.  ","890":"In view of the above, it should be assessed whether the  prohibition of Article 101(1) TFEU \ncatches the competition-limiting effects of the above-mentioned activities that are exempted \nfrom the cartel prohibition in combination with the computerized data exchange system that is \nbeing used. This assessment should focus on whether the prohibition of Article 101(1) \nTFEU  applies  or  is  likely  to  apply  in  the  near  future,  once  BI&A  systems  with  their \ncurrent \nexisting \nagreements\/arrangements that benefit from the exemption under the Consortia BER.  ","891":"Alliances are using vessel-sharing agreements and consider that those agreements will not \naffect mutual competition. The basic rationale for alliances is the facilitation of low rates and \nbroad service coverage.4 The deployment of data that is allowed to be exchanged under the \nConsortia BER gives a line the possibility of attaining these objectives in a way that seriously \nthreatens fair and undistorted competition if the exchange takes place within the context of a \nBI&A system with current state-of-the-art features which is semantically interoperable with the \ncomputer programs used by the parties that have been engaged for the implementation of its \nservices.  ","892":"All  lines  that  participate in  one  of  the  three  mega-alliances  -  2M,  Ocean  Alliance  and  THE \nAlliance  -  also  participate in  one  or more  of  the vast  number  of  conference and  discussion \nagreements  that  exist  worldwide.5  These  agreements  serve  as  vehicles  for  exchanging \nstrategically sensitive data. They are exempt from the application of antitrust laws in \nthe  United  States  and  some  Asian  countries,  like  Singapore,  but  they  were  never \nexempt from application in the EU.6 In light of the global coverage of global end-to-end \nservices  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  data  exchanged  between  members  of  an \nalliance on the key parameters of the rates for the non-EU leg of the route provides an \nimportant indicator, indeed if not the basis, for the pricing policy adopted for the global \nservices inclusive of the EU-leg of the route. BI&A systems with their current state-of-the-\nart features offer a major improvement for analyzing this data. As a result, the deployment of \nthese systems may seriously aggravate the anticompetitive effects of the data exchanged.  ","893":" \n \n\fThe above anticompetitive effects are particularly apparent if the exchange of data takes place \nwithin the context of services that are being implemented by a line together with other actors \nand  the  BI&A  system  used  by  the  line  has  been  made  semantically  interoperable  with  the \ncomputer programs of the latter.  ","894":"This  product  substantially  improves  the  joint  coordination  of  sailing  timetables  within  the \nalliance and thereby the determination of ports-of-call. As such, these activities fall within the \nexemption of the Consortia BER. However, the alliance offers the new product to third parties \nas part of its liner shipping services at a price that was fixed by the parties to the alliance who \nconjointly  own  the  product  in  mutual  consultation.  In  doing  so,  the  alliance  and  the \nparticipating lines violate the hard-core restriction of Article 4 sub 1 of the consortia \nBER. Furthermore, if other lines or alliances cannot come up with a timely response by \nbringing up a product that \u201cleapfrogs\u201d the new BI&A product, this may cause shippers \nto disproportionally  opt  for  the services  offered  by  the  alliance  that  disposes  of this \nlatter product. As a result, other lines and alliances lose their competitiveness for the duration \nof the validity of this new product\u2019s IP rights. This will give the alliance that disposes of the \nnew product entrenched market power 8 which, in turn, may well encourage it to raise the price \nof its services, arguing that it has the right to do so in order to recoup the investments that had \nto be made.  ","895":"In the above hypothetical situation, the new BI&A product transforms the coordination \nof sailing timetables within the alliance disposing of this product into conduct that has \nimmediate,  substantial  and  foreseeable  anti-competitive  effects  on  the  EU  market9. \nSuch conduct falls within the prohibition of Article 101(1) and Article 4 sub 1 of the current \nconsortia BER and\/or 102 TFEU, at least during the validity of the IP rights. ","896":"It has been argued above that an effective and smooth implementation of a global end-to-end \ncontract requires a line\/alliance to be made privy to confidential data - possibly protected by \nIP  rights  -  owned  by  actors  that  have  been  engaged  for  the  implementation  thereof.  Thus, \nwithin the framework of these contracts the free pass for exchanges of information as provided \nby  the  current  Consortia  BER  extends  to  data  that  has  been  developed  and  protected  by \nactors  whose  activities  relate  to  sections  of  the  shipping  industry  where  market  and \ncompetitive  conditions  fundamentally  differ  from  those  that  lines  are  confronted  with  in  the \ncontext of their core business.  ","897":"Self-assessments  from  the  perspective  of  the  global  market  in  which  lines  operate \nshould  also  relate  to  data  on  issues  that  are  allowed  under  some  jurisdictions  but \nprohibited under EU antitrust law. Thus, the possibilities for the Commission to monitor \ndistortions of competition from the perspective of the extra-territorial application of EU \nantitrust law and the qualified effects doctrine would be improved. This could facilitate \nother  actors  in  the  maritime  transport  in  their  attempts  to  challenge  agreements \nimplying undesirable market effects.10  ","898":"As  yet,  the  EU  Commission  does  not  dispose  of  tools  that  are  sufficiently  adequate  and \neffective  to  guarantee  fair  and  undistorted  competition  and  a  level  playing  field  to  all  the \nstakeholders in the competitive environment of containerized liner shipping services that has \nbeen unlocked by Big Data and BI&A systems. The ensuing legal vacuum creates a complex \nlegal border area ","899":"The present circumstances, however unfortunate they may be, do not absolve undertakings \nfrom the obligation to assess whether the agreements\/arrangements to which they are party, \ndirectly or indirectly, in isolation or in combination with other factors under their control, have \nas  their  object  or  effect  distortions  of  competition  that  emerge  in  the  realm  of  the  major \nparameters that govern the BI&A systems which underlie the logistics chain of their services.  ","900":"This implies that, apart from prices, account should be taken of common information \ntechnology  standards,  engagement  of  actors  in  the  implementation  of  services, \nimplementation of services as such and trust. Irrespective of the Consortia BER being \nnow prolonged in what manner, this assessment should be made in light of the impact \nBI&A systems with their current and anticipated state-of-the-art features together with \nthe surrounding Big Data have on the promotion of competition that must be generated \nin  order  for  agreements\/arrangements  to  be  considered  for  an  exemption  from  the \nprohibition of Article 101(1) TFEU.

For example, requirements imposed by GDPR have made it increasingly difficult for smaller players in the ad tech ecosystem to process and transfer data. In stark contrast, large platforms such as Google can condition access to their dominant services on a user\u2019s agreement with their data processing terms, typically enabling them to collect and combine vast amounts of data from and across various different services. The ad tech services that these large platforms can provide based on the resulting detailed consumer profiles cannot be matched by smaller independent players, hence driving them out of the market and resulting in an ever-greater share of online ad revenue for a very small number of large online platforms. \nI - Lack of access to a given input\/asset \u2013 Access to an input under the control of a firm with market power which is critical to provide a given service can lead to structural competition problems. For example, access to search data is critical to build a successful search engine. The search data that a monopoly search provider obtains access to vastly outweighs that of any small competitor, hence perpetuating the incumbent\u2019s monopoly position as it can continue improving its service based on the data its service generates while others cannot do so to the same extent.\nK - Strong direct network effects \u2013 Strong direct network effects make it more challenging for smaller players to challenge the incumbent, as their services cannot yet benefit from the value derived from those network effects. The result is that the inherent quality of the service offered by a small player must be vastly superior to that of the incumbent in order to convince a critical mass of consumers to forego the benefits of the network effects by switching away to the new service. Overcoming this collective action problem is challenging and can lead to structural competition problems, especially if the incumbent raises switching costs, e.g., by limiting interoperability or data portability.\nL - Strong indirect network effects \u2013 If is often critical to the business strategy of an online platform to bring users on both sides of the platform on board as soon as possible.  For transaction platforms, it might be difficult for new players to convince potential users on both sides of the platform\u2019s value proposition if they already transact on an existing platform they are familiar with. For non-transaction platforms, where direct network effects typically play a more prominent role, indirect network effects can nonetheless be a significant hurdle to overcome, e.g., if the incumbent has been able to attract lots of advertisers to its platform and can use those advertising revenues to improve the services for the users on its platform.\nP - Zero-pricing markets \u2013 Zero-pricing markets are prone to structural competition problems as the single most efficient way for new players to gain a foothold in a monopolized market, i.e., offering products or services at a lower price when the monopolist extracts monopoly rents, is not present in such markets. New players can still offer their services at a \u201clower price\u201d in zero-price markets, for example by offering their services under terms that are more privacy friendly, but the effects of such lower data price are not felt as directly by most consumers as differences in monetary prices in non-zero markets. Zero-pricing markets are also likely to exhibit other characteristics that make it more prone to structural competition problems, such as data dependency and indirect network effects, as revenues in zero-pricing markets are often generated through advertising fueled by vast swaths of data.\nQ - Data dependency \u2013 Data is critical to many digital services, for example as an input to offer or improve consumer-facing services, or as a means to monetize services offered in zero-pricing markets. Structural competition problems exist where one or few players have a competitive data advantage which they can use to lure more consumers to their data-driven personalized services, which smaller players cannot offer absent access to such data, or to lure advertisers to their platform with the promise of better targeted advertising and therefore a higher advertising ROI, to the detriment of smaller (or more privacy conscious) players unable to offer the same degree of ad targeting and ad measurement services.\nFor example, the market for general search services has tipped towards Google as consumers started using its search engine and Google could use the search data it thus gathered further to improve its search service, resulting in a positive feedback loop that led to the marginalization of search competitors.  As a result, virtually all search advertising revenues have gone to Google for years.  Google over the years has also consistently leveraged its monopoly power in search to other adjacent markets.These strategies are commonly engaged in by large online platforms with market power, but we believe it would probably be incorrect to state that these strategies are very common in the digital industry as a whole.Leveraging strategies can take many forms, such as tying or preferencing vertically integrated services over similarly situated services provided by third parties.  Consistent leveraging strategies can especially lead to competition concerns when the product or service offered by the company with market power is also a critical parameter of competition in an adjacent market, and when control over that parameter of competition enables that company to obtain an unnatural competitive advantage that cannot be matched by third parties without such control.  Ownership of a search engine and the resulting control over the display of search results, and the ownership of an app store and the resulting control over the rules for app distribution are timely examples.Companies with control over an important parameter of competition can repeatedly use that control to leverage their market power into further adjacent markets.  As competition cases only remedy specific anticompetitive conduct, new cases need be brought every time a company engages in a new leveraging strategy.  The Commission should be able to intervene in situations where current competition laws fall short of disciplining companies with market power engaging in such repeated strategies by remedying not just the individual conduct in question but also the underlying structural competition problem.See response to Question 9.1 above.","929":"Tipping scenarios are especially prevalent in markets where significant network effects are at play.Network effects increase the attractiveness of large platforms, hence attracting more users to those platforms and perpetuating the positive feedback loop until the market tips in favor of one player.  These effects are felt even more strongly in markets where consumers single-home.Many digital sectors are characterized by the factors listed in Question 16.3.Tipping scenarios are likely to lead to the exclusion of smaller competitors in the long run.  Monopoly power is expected to lead to less innovation and higher prices for consumers.The anticompetitive harm resulting from tipping scenarios is difficult to undo once competition has been marginalized and consumers are used to the dominant platform.  Once the tipping has occurred, high switching costs for consumers, for example due to a lack of interoperability or data portability, might make any remedies ineffective.  Early intervention in tipping markets will often be key to preserve competition.Not all tipping scenarios are the result of anticompetitive agreements or abuses of market power, hence we believe Articles 101\/102 TFEU are not at all times sufficiently effective to preserve competition in tipping markets.Digital markets characterized by network effects are likely to be concentrated.  As consumers increasingly rely on digital services, a few large companies hold control over the most significant entry points to the Internet, e.g., Google as the owner of Google Search, YouTube, Android OS and the Play Store.  Consumers virtually have no choice but to use the services of these digital giants and other businesses depend on these services to reach consumers.","930":"All of the above features are important and contribute to a company\u2019s gatekeeper role.All of the above-listed concerns are important, especially when a company uses its gatekeeper power to determine the competitive dynamics to the advantage of a vertically integrated service.Certain gatekeepers determine the competitive dynamics of millions of businesses\u2019 interactions with billions of consumers.  Given the importance of these digital services to the businesses involved and to consumers\u2019 everyday lives, there is a need for the EC to be able to ensure that fair competition can work to the benefit of consumers.Article 102 TFEU may be suitable to intervene in markets characterised by \u2018gatekeeper platforms\u2019 in order to preserve\/improve competition, though Question 18 notes that \u201ca gatekeeper may not necessarily be \u2018dominant\u2019 within the meaning of Article 102 of the EU Treaty\u201d, in which case Article 102 TFEU would fall short.We believe no sectors\/markets are immune to structural competition problems.","931":"We believe structural competition problems will most often not be the result of anticompetitive agreements.  We believe anticompetitive agreements can sufficiently be addressed under Article 101 TFEU, but Article 101 TFEU is likely not the right tool to address structural competition problems, which are often the result of specific market characteristics or the unavoidable nature of one of the parties active in that market.","932":"The tool should be horizontal in nature as no sector\/market is immune to structural competition problems.The tool should be horizontal in nature as no sector\/market is immune to structural competition problems.All of the above tools can be useful in principle, though we believe the power to impose remedies on companies to deal with identified and demonstrated structural competition problems is most important.All of the above remedies should be available to the EC.  The EC will decide which types of remedies are appropriate and proportionate depending on the findings of its investigation.","933":"In general, we believe there are no structural competition problems that can only be dealt with by structural remedies, though we agree that structural remedies might be necessary in some cases to ensure that fair competition is reinstated, especially if there is a history of non-structural remedies not being effective in addressing anticompetitive behavior or structural competition problems in the market in question.We fail to see how enforcement without appropriate investigative powers could be effective.The EC should have investigative powers similar to the ones it has under current competition laws.Speed of enforcement will be critical to address structural competition problems effectively and to prevent irreparable harm to competition from arising, but all relevant parties\u2019 procedural rights should be safeguarded.  Binding legal deadlines will help achieve a balance between speed of enforcement, legal certainty and parties\u2019 rights of defence.Interim measures can be a necessary tool to pre-empt irreparable harm while the EC\u2019s investigation is ongoing.Voluntary commitments provide much-needed flexibility and may serve to resolve structural competition problems in an even more expeditious way, though should only be relied upon on condition that they are as effective as remedies imposed by the EC and that the EC has the ability to monitor compliance with the proposed voluntary commitments.Industry input is important.Industry input is important.Adequate procedural safeguards are necessary to ensure the legitimacy of the EC\u2019s use of the new competition tool.A new competition tool that enables the EC to remedy structural competition problems (across all sectors and without the need for a finding of dominance) following an in-depth investigation would be most appropriate, potentially in combination with a regulatory framework imposing obligations and prohibitions that are generally applicable to all online platforms with gatekeeper power.","934":"Digital  business  models  have  become  complex  and  multi-layered,  especially  due  to  the \ncritical  role  of  the  big  online  platforms  governing  the  relationship  between  the  different \nparties  in  the  whole  ecosystem.

It can give rise to competition issues particularly if it is a gatekeeper that is vertically integrated. ","943":"The use of pricing algorithms does not raise novel competition law issues as such and should be capable of being addressed through the European Commission\u2019s (the \u201cCommission\u201d) existing enforcement powers. In essence, a pricing algorithm will invariably be based on information which is already publicly available and there is, in our view, a lesser need for specific additional enforcement powers to address possible concerns with competitors adjusting (for example) their pricing based on publicly available information. While a pricing algorithm is invariably capable of obtaining publicly available data at a faster rate, and from more sources, than is possible from a manual exercise, there is sufficient similarities in substance between the practices to be adequately addressed by existing enforcement tools. To the extent that pricing algorithms are designed following, or leads to, collusion, agreement or concerted practices between competitors to, for example, fix prices, they will fall squarely within Article 101 TFEU. ","944":"In relation to anti-competitive monopolisation, it is important to differentiate between scenarios where the market player is able to put competitors at a disadvantage by virtue of a structural competition issue in the relevant market, and scenarios where the ability does not stem from an underlying structural issue. The fact that a market operator is able to rapidly expand its market share by putting competitors at a disadvantage is not necessarily an indication of a structural problem in the market.  ","945":"The remaining features \/ scenarios are all very important when determining whether a particular market exhibits structural competition problems, as follows:\n- Highly concentrated markets: irrespective of the presence or lack of significant barriers to entry, a market which at the relevant time consists of only one or a few players will enable a certain degree of market alignment \/ coordination which, all things being equal, is not present to the same degree in markets with a larger number of operators. It will often be in the interest of each operator to avoid undercutting each other on, for example, price and the risk of another entity \u201cgaming\u201d the status quo by deviating from the aligned approach reduces as the number of operators on the market decreases. The structure of the market (viz the low number of active participants) creates this increased risk of problematic alignment.\n- Gatekeeper scenarios: in gate-keeping scenarios, the rules of participation on the relevant market will, to a large extent, be determined by the gate-keeper itself. While competition may exist between entities operating on or using the relevant medium controlled by the gate-keeper (e.g. a platform), the extent and nature of such competition is invariably influenced to a large extent by the rules of access to the platform , which is set by the gate-keeper. This is particularly problematic in scenarios where the gate-keeper is vertically integrated and also competes on downstream or neighbouring markets with other platform users. The key question is whether access to the platform\/data is the equivalent of an \u201cessential facility\u201d for other service providers. \n- Tipping (or \u201cwinner takes most\u201d) markets: given the nature of tipping markets, once the \u201ctipping point\u201d has been reached, the market player(s) remaining will be deeply entrenched and customers highly unlikely to switch. In particular, the remaining players are very unlikely to be challenged by successful new entry. Whether this requires new enforcement tools for the Commission to address depends, to a large extent, on whether the aim of EU competition law includes, in addition to protecting consumer interest, the protection of competition itself. If the protection of consumers (rather than competition itself) is paramount, any \u201cpost-tipping point\u201d issues should be addressable under Article 102 and\/or Article 101. However, there are good reasons to also enable intervention in order to protect the competitive process itself (and encourage new entrants \/ innovation etc.), which will require additional enforcement powers...Where a company has a repeated strategy to extend its market power into neighbouring markets \u2013 is indicative that its market position in its core activity is a critical platform or data set that other rivals may need to have access to in order to develop their own products in other markets \u2013 and as such a repeated strategy can have a dampening effect on innovation by third parties, and continue to concentrate power into the hands of one entity in a particular industry.In light of the increased pace of change, as both of these treaty provisions rely on a post ex investigation \u2013 with a company fighting significant fines this gives  give the undertaking concerned more time to cement its market position \u2013 rather than pro-actively prevent the abuse or exclusionary conduct from occurring.In certain instances of former monopolies using their asset or data base to prevent or delay market entry...The monopolization of assets or data can raise entry barriers for rival entities. However a balance needs to be struck between preserving the efficiencies that certain monopolies can generate \u2013 and ensuing that this does not impede new entrants in neighbouring markets.Where there is a structural issue this tends to indicate that entry barriers are for some reason high ( whether because of regulatory barriers or concentration of assets or data). Careful intervention can help maintain the necessary efficiencies, while allowing some competition to arise.Post ex investigations with the ultimate outcome of significant fines takes too long and is not the best way to address structural issues that require a more flexible and collaborative approach to finding a solution that improves competition in an industry.They tend to be those markets where either assets or data is concentrated in the ownership pf 2 or 3 undertakings, and entry barriers for potential entrants are high..","946":"Just because an industry is prone to tacit collusion, does not mean it is in fact occurring. Art 101 is sufficient to deal with these situation where there is still a burden of proof to be met..Yes we submit the Commission should still prove there was collusion \u2013 the fact an industry may be prone to it is not sufficient to justify an intervention.","947":".The Commission should be able to investigate to verify whether in fact the algorithms are actually having an anti-competitive effect , as much will depend on how the programme was written and what decisions are taken based on the information  resulting from the algorithm.To date the cases taken up by various competition regulators relating to algorithms have shown that the same ingredients are present as in a traditional art 101 case. (see for example the UK CMA\u2019s case on sports posters).It has been in industries where having more aggregated data gives the competitive advantage...Tipping often occurs because there are clear efficiencies in one aggregator \u2013 they main concern however it the long term effect on a market that may have \u2013 and it then becomes important to ensure that third parties can access hat centralised data or platform on fair and reasonable terms. Where there is then also vertical integration \u2013 it may mean that the core data\/platform is ring fenced  and the activities in neighbouring markets are put on a equal footing as third parties to allow for innovation to take place in a level playing field.\nThis would help the tipping causing  long term issues in an industry and ensuing that access to the key data\/platform is accessible for others \u2013 thereby preventing the creation of high entry barriers developing.Articles 101 \/102 provide for ex post intervention, whereas it tipping markets it would be better to be able to intervene sooner , an rather than imposing fines, put in place things like FRAND obligations.It is in digital sector where currently there is the greatest concentration of data, and where data is being used for competitive advantage..Where tipping has in fact already occurred, it is clear that having the greatest number of users will continue to attract more users thereby re-enforcing that tipping effect.Gatekeepers, may well be very successful and innovative companies which naturally determine the competition dynamics in an industry \u2013 and that can be pro-competitive, what is more important is whether users are locked in or can switch or dual home , so that rivals can develop as well to challenge a gatekeeper.Gatekeepers should be monitored as to the extent that they lock in users and deliberately look to increase entry barriers for rivals.In certain circumstances it would be better to intervene earlier to prevent such a drastic structural changes and ensure that entry barriers are not necessarily increased.While structural competition concerns may be more prevalent, or more likely to arise, in certain sectors \/ markets (such as, for example, utilities and digital sectors), there is no fundamental reason why structural competition problems would be incapable of arising in any particular sector. In a digital context, an obvious example of a possible structural competition law issue is where a digital platform occupies a very significant position on the market and act as a de facto gate-keeper for operators who wish to use the particular channel. This is exacerbated further in cases where the gate-keeper is also an active user of the platform. Conversely, in a non-digital context, possible structural competition issues can arise in, for example, essential facilities cases (e.g. operator of a harbour) where access is required for competitors to effectively enter the market and where the terms of such access is set by the operator \/ owner of the essential facility. ","948":"On a conceptual level, there is also merit in an ex ante acknowledgement that new and unforeseen structural competition issues may arise and that this risk is not confined to any particular market or sector. In particular, it is important to consider the impact and evaluate the usefulness of any new enforcement powers for the Commission across a wide range of market \/ sectors, rather than prematurely confine such powers to the particular \u201chot topic\u201d sectors currently occupying the attention of competition law enforcers. There may, of course, be legitimate reasons for prioritising any new enforcement powers to particular sectors \/ markets (e.g. adequate sector-specific regulation and enforcement), but such confinement should not be based on the perceived inability of structural competition law issues to arise in any market sectors \/ markets. A holistic approach and wide scope of application for new enforcement powers will also help avoid the creation of a patchwork approach to competition law enforcement further down the line and the creation of confusion for market operators and consumers, especially as certain commercial activities may converge and access to big data becomes more important to many different areas.See responses to Q20..An example would be sort term exclusionary agreements by a gate keeper, which individually do not have an appreciable effect on competition, and while could be caught by the prohibition under the network effect \u2013 by that time for ex post regulation to take place tipping effect may have already resulted in a structural market change.Data intensive markets.If you want to look to prevent monopolies being created as a result of tipping effects -then you would need to be able to intervene before  Article 102 is applicable and there has already been that structural change in place..Where gate keepers are created these should be capable of being regulated to ensure that there is a balance between the efficiencies and innovation  and restricting others from being able to access the key assets \/data for them to be able innovate.Early intervention should seek to ensure that entry barriers for third parties are not deliberately increased through exclusionary contract or behaviour.","949":"While there is some merit in confining a new competition law tool to dominant undertakings, in particular by circumscribing the Commission\u2019s power to make wholesale changes to markets and leaving such decisions within the competence of national regulators or legislative bodies, there are three main reasons why a new enforcement tools which can intervene in a pro-competitive way earlier where an entity has strategic market importance is preferable to dominance-based intervention. Such intervention would be focussed on preserving\/creating competition, rather than fine-based ex-post infringement enforcement. \nFirstly, while some platforms start as national ones, through the use of the internet they increasingly become pan-European, and such intervention is then much better done at EU level, to avoid divergent and costly individual national investigations and outcomes. , \nSecondly, a new enforcement tool which enables intervention with a horizontal scope irrespective of whether any particular entity is dominant or not can be seen as a natural extension of the Commission\u2019s existing power to conduct sector inquiries. Sector inquiries are particularly suitable to unearth underlying, structural competition problems in a particular market. It makes sense that the Commission, at the end of a sector inquiry (where it will have accumulated a significant amount of sector expertise), should be able to effectively address the problems it has identified in its sector inquiry. Such problems will not necessarily be confined to dominant undertakings. \nFinally, a dominance-based tool would, by its very nature, prevent intervention before an entity has become dominant (e.g. it would not allow intervention in tipping markets, prior to the inflexion point at which an entity is likely to become dominant). Given that structural competition issues can arise, or the foundation of such issues can arise, with or without dominant undertakings, it makes little sense to confine a competition law tool designed to address structural competition law issues to cases involving dominance.","950":"\nThe tool should be subject to legal and procedural constrains, but not limited as to sector \u2013 given that it should not seek to distort competition between different sectors where there may be innovation that blur the lines between sectors.As markets evolve the lines between what may be considered a digital market and not is likely to blur.The remedies in the list above would all be useful and appropriate for the Commission to ensure that the new enforcement tool is both effective and allows the Commission to tailor its proposed actions \/ remedies to the particular situation. For example, it might be that a certain issue would require legislative change to be adequately addressed, where it would be sensible for the Commission to have the power to draw on the findings from its investigation (using the new tool) and make suggestions for new legislation. Similarly, certain sectors will fall under the jurisdiction of sector specific regulators, who will have a deeper level of understanding of the particular market, where it would be sensible to enable to Commission to make suggestions to the relevant sector regulator, but leave the design, implementation and monitoring of the relevant remedies to the sector regulator.\nNon-binding recommendations constitute a relatively non-intrusive remedy and will help foster self-regulation and better operation of the relevant market. It will also give undertakings a greater degree of freedom in how they ensure compliance with the recommendation (c.f. a more prescriptive set of binding regulations). However, there is also a need for the Commission to ultimately be able to impose binding remedies on companies in order to address structural competition issues. A comprehensive toolbox of remedies, coupled with clear rules governing the Commission\u2019s decision as to when a particular remedy is the most appropriate, would enable to Commission to adequately and, importantly, proportionately address possible competition issues identified. \nAs stated in response to question 30.1, above, it is important to ensure that the Commission is able to adequately, and proportionally, address potential structural competition issues it has identified. This will requires the Commission to be able both to respond with more \u201clight-touch\u201d remedies where appropriate (e.g. non-binding recommendations etc.) and also ensure compliance through binding remedies. \nHowever, allowing the Commission to order divestment (and in this context it is important to recall that the new enforcement tool would not necessarily be confined to cases which also fall within Articles 101 or 102 TFEU) would likely effect a sea-change in EU competition law and should not be included as part of the new enforcement tool without very careful consideration, and only as a last resort (given there are other remedies available such as ring-fencing certain activities, as is the case with utilities that have both regulated and competitive activities). \nIn particular, it would change the current position that EU law permits companies to occupy a dominant position so long as they do not abuse that dominance, and allow divestment orders for both dominant and non-dominant companies in order to address perceived structural competition law issues. If structural divestments are permitted in this way, it would be difficult to maintain the current approach to Article 102 TFEU (i.e. that dominance in and of itself is not prohibited) which, in turn, might lead to an influx of complaints from competitors against dominant companies even in the absence of any abuse allegation, in the hope of securing a divestment order.\nEqually, one would not want to disincentivise companies from innovating and expanding, nor put up unnecessary hurdles to potential efficiencies that may arise from being a vertically integrated business that understands different aspects of a sector.","951":"There may be behavioural \/contract remedies available.Given that the new tool will be very intrusive - it needs to be used only where it is clearly justified and subject to clear procedural rights for the defendants.Given the time consuming nature of any regulatory investigation, if entirely voluntary \u2013 many  companies will choose not to comply.Both companies and regulators need to have both the discipline and the transparency provided by binding deadlines  and when are the key milestones.Subject to clear legal burden of proof  \u2013 there may be circumstances where the balance would favour taking interim measures.Voluntary commits typical lead to a quicker solution and a more collaborative approach by the investigated companies.This is an essential requirement of due process, and will help to ensure that any remedy imposed is actually workable.Consultation with third parties will help to ensure that the remedies are workable and actually address the concern identified.That is a legal requirement to protect the rights of all undertakings.The current framework of competition law enforcement powers at the EU level, coupled with the emergence of digital and digital-enabled markets, has created an enforcement gap, as Article 101 and 102 TFEU require, respectively, either some form of bilateral interaction between independent undertakings or that the undertaking in question is dominant. By enabling intervention in, for example, tipping markets or gate-keeper scenarios before the relevant operators\u2019 market position has become entrenched to the point of dominance, or in cases where an undertaking is dominant but without any element of abuse, the Commission will be better able to address structural competition issues on a proactive basis and protect consumers. There is a need for additional enforcement powers, in digital markets especially. \nPowers 2,3 and 4 are all needed to ensure that the Commission and EU competition law is able to help ensure that digital markets, and digital platforms in particular, work in the interest of consumers and help foster competition on the merits. Given the ubiquitous character of platforms in the digital age, and the potential for operators of such platforms to very quickly establish a significant degree of market power to the exclusion of potential competitors, there are good grounds for developing an overarching framework of principles \/ rules to govern the operation of such platforms ab initio. Such guidelines should ensure that platforms afford access on FRAND terms and\/or allow for interoperability and data transfer. In order to effectively operate as a set of overarching rules applying to a wide range of different platforms, the framework will necessarily be confined to setting out high-level principles governing platforms rather than granular rules. \nThere is, therefore, also a need for supplementary powers to intervene in a more direct way in individual cases where there is a risk of structural competition issues emerging (or to correct issues which have already arisen) in regards a particular market or platform. From an efficiency perspective, it would also be preferable for the Commission to have the power to not only address particular operators, but also address more systemic issues where such systemic issues contribute to structural competition issues across a wider range of different platforms. The alternative to addressing systemic issues in this way, i.e. intervention on a case-by-case basis to correct the effects of a common structural issue, would unnecessarily tie up Commission resources. Potential issues of institutional competence to make these types of sweeping structural changes can be ameliorated by including suitable requirements on the Commission to consult stakeholders prior to any changes and ensuring a sufficient transition period (in addition to the normal appeal avenues).","952":"European Horizons is a global, student-led policy incubator committed to giving young people \na voice in shaping the future of Europe and of transatlantic relations.

The  growing  divide \nbetween  slow-moving  legislative  and  regulatory  bodies  and  fast-paced  technological \ninnovation, combined with disruptive business models of the digital economy, have created an \namalgamation of complex and interdependent problems. Of particular concern is the fact that \nEuropean  citizens  are  increasingly  exposed  to  orchestrated  and  hostile  disinformation \ncampaigns, in addition to being de facto powerless vis-a-vis online platforms and big tech in \ntheir claim for fulfillment of their human right to data privacy.

The European Single Market has helped \ntransform  the  European  continent  into  a  global,  economic  heavyweight.  Therefore,  the \nEuropean  Commission  must  implement  new  regulations  to  strengthen  interoperability \nbetween  online  platforms,  data  protection,  and  data  privacy,  and  to  counter  the  anti-\ndemocratic  phenomena  of  hate-speech  and  disinformation,  in  a  fair,  robust,  and  intelligent \nmanner.

The  rise  of  dominant \nonline  platforms,  which  leverage  large  network  and  scale  effects  to  turn  themselves  into \ngatekeepers,  is  economically  and  socially  harmful.  The  already  strong  market  position  of \ngatekeepers is amplified by SMEs increasingly facing walled gardens. These small and medium \nenterprises cannot match the sheer scale of data accessible to dominant online platforms and \nthus risk being pushed out of business. Such structural risks for competition are empirically \nknown  to  foster  decreasing  research  and  development  spending  and,  ultimately,  stall \ninnovation in the European Digital Single Market.

","959":"It is further important to apply a broader scope to the definition of significant digital presence \nby  considering  multifaceted  online  platforms.  Only  then  can  regulation  consider  online \nplatforms which incorporate operating systems, multiple applications, application stores, and \nmarketplaces.  Online  platforms  below  a  pre-defined  qualifying  threshold  for  a  significant \ndigital presence will be exempt from remedies aimed at the largest gatekeepers specifically, \nthus  this  document  uses  the  term online platform when  referring  to  gatekeeper  platforms \nwith significant digital presence. ","960":"Although the issue of corporate taxation lies clearly outside of the scope of this consultation, \nwe want to emphasize that the concept of a significant digital presence was launched and \nintroduced as a pre-requirement for a subsequent digital services tax applied to the European \nDigital Single Market.

The \nnew  generation  of  online  platforms  and  hardware  operating  systems,  however,  are \ncharacterized  by  reduced  interoperability.  Unchecked  by  regulatory  authorities  these  online \nplatforms  leverage  network  effects  to  build  artificial  and  shielded  platform-specific \necosystems. In other words, a lack of interoperability is utilized to decrease competition by \nheightened entry barriers, effectively boosting market dominance.

Other  sectors  characterized  by  natural  monopolies  are  transmission \nsystem operators, telecommunication, railway, or pharma. In order to avoid monopolization, \neconomic inefficiencies, and welfare losses, regulators need to step in to introduce fair and \ntransparent  rules  governing  the  market.  For  many  markets,  the  European  Commission  has \nalready  wisely  established  regulatory  legislation.  Since  the  three  liberalization  packages  for \nthe (horizontal) integration of European energy markets, competition in the market has thrived \nand ultimately helped facilitate the emergence of renewable energy. A more recent, though no \nless impactful, European policy measure is the Payment Services Directive, PSD2, addressing \nfairness and transparency in the banking and financial system.

Specifically, \ndecoupling of the digital market to establish a digital infrastructure of databases, metadata, \nstandards, and protocols used by online platforms. Secondly, enforcement of interoperability \nbetween platform utility operators and businesses providing goods and services in an over-\nthe-top  manner.  Minimum  interoperability  requirements  should  be  introduced  to  allow \ncompeting  applications  and  SME  software  solutions  to  simply  plug  into  larger  platform \nsystems via standardized communication protocols and programmable database interfaces.

Therefore, the European \nCommission\u2019s proposal to establish prohibited unfair trading practices should not be perceived \nas a radical step but as a long-awaited correction of pre-existing legal loopholes. The special \ncharacteristic of digital markets requires legislation which addresses structural competition \nproblems ex ante and not, as so far, ex post. We are convinced that market regulation is more \neffective when it is not an emergency intervention but is rather of a preventive nature. In order \nto  pursue  such  a  prevention-driven  approach  several  unfair  trading  practices  should  be \nincluded in new digital market denylists:  ","965":"When the European Commission introduced the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, it \nventured to protect the most fundamental rights of data subjects. The DSA package is not just \na further regulation of the digital market but also the chance to correct shortcomings of the \nGDPR and to double-down on promising provisions. We reiterate the urgent need for users to \nhave  access  to  effective  and  transparent  data  management  tools  which  support  data \nportability as outlined in Article 20 GDPR.

In addition to merely requiring \nonline  platforms  to  follow  requests  for  disclosure  of  collected  and  processed  user  data, \nenhanced  GDPR  enforcement  should  also  lead  to  disclosure  of  the  economic  value  of  user \ndata as online platforms earn huge profits by applying data processing algorithms. By pursuing \nthis approach, the European Commission would build on the official staff working documents \non  the  Guidance on the Implementation\/Application of Directive 2005\/29\/EC on Unfair \nCommercial Practices  and  court  rulings  lamenting  the  practice  by  online  platforms  of \nobscuring the true cost of service.  ","967":"We  appreciate  that  the  European  Commission  pursued  a  path  of  increased  focus  on  data \nprotection in recent years. Yet we need to stress the importance of effective policy solutions \nand regulations requiring third parties to meet European data protection standards. The recent \nSchrems II verdict demonstrated well that existing agreements, such as the EU-U.S. Privacy \nShield Framework, cannot  guarantee  protection  of  European  data  subjects  at  this  point  in \ntime. Particularly U.S. surveillance programs failed to meet the legal requirements as outlined \nin Article 52 of the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights. This is of particular concern, as more \nthan 5,000 companies contributing to a \u20ac6trn transatlantic economic partnership relied on the \nfunctioning of the Privacy Shield. We recommend the European Commission fully leverage the \neffectiveness of the upcoming DSA package and work towards a new agreement to protect \nEuropean  data  subjects  in  order  to  uphold  the  principle  of  effective  judicial  protection  of \nCommunity law. ","968":"When large online platforms extract data and the vast associated economic value, it weakens \nthe  competitiveness  in  and  of  the  European  Digital  Single  Market  and  favors  commercial \ninterests  over  social  welfare.  One  could  argue  that  by  leaving  such  practices  unchecked, \nEurope is massively investing abroad by providing (mostly) free data. Thus, we identified an \nurgent  need  to  build  trusted  institutions  and  to  strengthen  data  sharing.  Effective  data \nportability requires a competitive end-point to move data to. In order to provide a competitive \nplatform utility infrastructure, a trusted data sharing space is the minimum requirement that \nthe European Commission should encourage. We recommend that the DSA package grants the \nminimum possibility of moving data to personal pods in the European Common Data Space. \nThere, data could be further managed in compliance with GDPR and other data governance \nneeds  of  any  individual  or  business.  Data  sharing  should  be  encouraged  via  trusted \nintermediaries, which ensure interoperability and may restrict access to subjects violating data \nsharing terms and conditions.

We recognize that investments in cloud computing ","969":"Online  platforms  are  obligated  to  perform  Algorithmic  Impact  Assessment  tests  for  high-\nimpact  algorithms  on  socio-economic  activities.  This  approach  extends  the  high-risk \nrequirements as outlined in the European Commission\u2019s White Paper on Artificial Intelligence. \nWhen online platforms with a significant digital presence change algorithms (such as search \nengine algorithms), it can lead to unintended consequences on digital markets. Therefore, the \nEuropean  Commission  should  make  AIA  tests  mandatory  for  all  algorithm  changes  by \ngatekeepers. The AIA test should measure the following:  ","970":"AIA tests should be performed under a licensing regime. Auditing and testing by a European \nregulator and mandated research institutes should be a precondition for a change and release \nof  algorithm  changes.  The  main  outcomes  of  Algorithmic  Impact  Assessments  should  be \naccessible to the wider public via digital leaflets (similar to practices in the pharmaceutical \nsector) and need to be in accordance with the explainable AI principle.

Reported  data \nshould include, but not be restricted to, social media usage, advertisement sales, e-commerce, \nand chosen high-impact sectors of social and economic activity, such as the housing market. \nRegular reporting should take place via a dedicated application programming interface. Due to \nthe  digital  market\u2019s  unique  characteristics,  regular  reporting  will  not  require  complex \nbureaucratic procedures and will be almost costless, as online platforms already monitor user \nactivity data. Thus, successful implementation will only be a matter of introducing a proper \nautomatic supervision framework.

To counter both the existence and the emergence of \nmarket  concentration  and  large  online  platforms  acting  as  gatekeepers,  the  European \nCommission should deploy ex ante tools which will prevent market dominance and abusive \nbehaviors.

A major study by Capital Economics, an\nindependent economic consultancy,\nrevealed in 2019 the significant benefits\nDeliveroo brings to the restaurant industry in Europe. The study shows that, as of\n2019, Deliveroo supported the generation of \u20ac2.25bn in revenue in the European\neconomy, which has helped to create over 46,000 additional jobs in the European\nrestaurant sector.  ","997":"During the COVID-19 crisis, platforms like Deliveroo have been a lifeline for \nrestaurants in Europe, with delivery becoming \nindustry during the national lockdowns. Thanks to Deliveroo, restaurants have \nreached customers they would not otherwise have reached and as a result, our \npartners have been able to keep a certain degree of economic activity to maintain \njobs and to avoid closure. ","998":"The crisis has also highlighted the symbiotic relationship between Deliveroo and the \nrestaurants on our platform. At the height of the crisis, many restaurants chose to \nclose entirely, which had a significant negative impact on the selection of restaurants \navailable to customers and, as a direct consequence, saw a reduction in the sales \nmade over our platform. We want our restaurant partners to succeed, which was \nunderlined by the actions we took during the outbreak and associated lockdowns. ","999":"To help restaurants struggling with cash flow, we brought\nforward the normal\npayment cycle so that restaurants could receive their payments on a daily\/weekly\nbasis. To ensure restaurant staff were protected during the crisis, and to give\nconsumers confidence that delivery is safe, we initiated contactless delivery\nhandovers with riders to minimise the risk of contagion. We invested in marketing\ncampaigns, aimed at boosting customer sales for local, independent restaurants and\nwe introduced a new feature in our app allowing consumers to round up their order\nand provide tips which go directly to restaurants. We also invested in new tools to\nenable customers to return to restaurants for dine-in, when regulations allowed. ","1000":"Just as we take our responsibilities to restaurant partners seriously, so we take our\nresponsibilities to the self-employed riders who work with us seriously as well. All our\nriders are covered by accident and injury insurance. We also took steps to protect\nriders during the COVID-19 outbreak. As mentioned above, we quickly initiated a\nnew contactless delivery process to minimise interaction between riders, restaurant\nstaff and customers. We set up a Rider Hardship Fund, ensuring riders had access to\nfinancial support if they were ill through Covid or were forced to self-isolate by a\nmedical authority. We have also sent regular communications to riders, advising\nthem on the latest government information and advice to keep safe, and distributed\nmasks and sanitiser.  ","1001":"For consumers too, Deliveroo has played an important social role since its creation, \nwhich has been strengthened during the crisis, bringing food to vulnerable and \nisolated people in their homes, initiating campaigns and donations to hospital staff \nand those in need. Deliveroo has also adapted its offer and its operations to cater for \nchanging consumer needs during the crisis, making sure the highest levels of safety \nwere adhered to and by ensuring essential foods were available, for example by \nstarting to work with supermarkets to ensure food could be delivered to those who \nwere self-isolating.  ","1002":"There are inherent limitations in the food delivery logistics model which significantly\ninhibits Deliveroo from scaling quickly at\nlow cost. This means that scaling up\ninvolves taking on more costs - and so there are limited scale efficiencies that could\ndisadvantage smaller players. These limitations can be summarised as follows:  ","1003":" Deliveroo scales by increasing orders, increasing restaurant \nselection and having a rider network that can fulfil all orders, whilst taking into \naccount the nuances of each geographical location. Deliveroo has to spend \nmoney to achieve sca\nle in each of the markets in which it operates. This is in \ncontrast to other online market players where there are zero marginal costs to \nscaling (e.g. Facebook acquiring new users).  ","1004":" There is a ceiling as to how efficient Deliveroo\u2019s \nrider network can become through scale.This is because Deliveroo delivers \nhighly perishable food meaning it must be delivered to customers quickly (i.e. \nunder 30 minutes) to retain its quality. Further, there are only so many orders \na rider can physically deliver within any given hour. This feature of Deliveroo\u2019s \npoint to point logistics model prevents Deliveroo from (for example) holding \nback cooked orders to collate them for delivery in either a single bulk drop or \nmultiple drops via a more efficient route. This is in contrast to the efficiencies \nthat can be achieved through scale by other online market players who \noperate a travelling salesman model.  ","1005":"Unlike some other online platforms, food delivery platforms\u2019 ability to benefit from\nnetwork effects are limited by the physical nature of the service we offer. The\ndistinction between different platforms\u2019 business models needs to be considered\nwhen determining policy in this area. At Deliveroo, we aim to deliver food within 30\nminutes of ordering. This means our operation is necessarily local - we will only ever\ndisplay a limited number of restaurants to a limited number of customers within an\napproximate 30 minute delivery time radius. This means any potential benefit from\nnetwork effects will always be capped. ","1006":"Having lots of restaurants in Paris, for example, will not attract a customer in Madrid\nto place a purchase over our platform. Even within a country, the same holds true.\nThe availability of riders in Milan will not help to deliver a customer\u2019s order on time in\nRome. Similarly, riders will not be incentivised to log into the app in Rome if there is a\nsurge in orders and higher delivery fees offered in Milan. ","1007":"21. We cannot benefit from large network effects in the way platforms will be able to\nwhen the service is not physical (e.g. services provided solely over the internet, like\nFacebook and Google), or where the delivery of an item sold over a platform is not\ntime sensitive (e.g. Amazon, where goods can be shipped over a much longer\ndelivery time than 30 minutes). ","1008":"Deliveroo\u2019s business is to deliver food from point A to point B quickly, while giving\ncustomers accurate estimates of delivery times upon which they can rely when\ndetermining the restaurant from which they wish to order. We must dispatch riders to\ndeliver orders in the most efficient manner possible, factoring in: ","1009":"G. All the other live and predicted orders in the system, i.e. what might be most\nefficient for one order will not be most efficient when all orders are considered\ntogether. Solving the operational challenge of delivering food from one point\nto another is hard enough for one order, but determining what is best for all\norders introduces a ","1010":"Our algorithm will calculate all the above, but will produce varying estimations which\nwill differ from country to country depending on (for example); the infrastructure of a\ncity (roads, buildings), weather, preferred vehicle types and traffic; local laws and the\nprevalence of multi-apping amongst riders; the relative split between take-away and\ndine-in orders for restaurants; and the prevalent cuisine types and associated food\npreparation time in different markets. Usable insights from the data are not easily\ntransferable between countries and it is therefore difficult for Deliveroo to leverage\nsuch data to launch, scale and improve its operations in other countries.

Like most online businesses, trivago is reliant on Google for a material portion of its user traffic, be it organic or paid. trivago also displays hotel offers on Google Hotel Finder to market its offers in many markets.Google has a quasi-monopoly over general search: at least since 2008, Google has consistently held remarkably high market shares across all 27 EU Member States, in most cases exceeding 90%, while no effective entry has taken place. Coupled with strong barriers to entry such as network effects, economies of scale, access to click-and-query data, and the need for significant investments , this means that Google\u2019s position is virtually incontestable. That has enabled Google to become the gatekeeper of user traffic flowing through its search engine.","1045":"Like most online businesses, trivago is reliant on Google for a material portion of user traffic. This is the case even though trivago has a highly recognizable brand and a strong direct relationship with consumers. In many cases, customers begin their journey with Google Search. This control of the top of the customer purchase funnel enables Google to act as a bottleneck, by e.g., diverting traffic from MSEs into its own vertical search products, to the detriment of MSEs. Indeed, Google has systematically engaged in such practices in order to promote its own vertical travel products, namely Hotel Finder (accommodation), Google Flights (flights) and VR finder (vacation rentals). Additional detail regarding Google\u2019s practices in respect of accommodation are described in our response to question 7 below.As discussed above, Google\u2019s control of the top of the customer purchase funnel enables Google to act as a bottleneck, by e.g., diverting traffic from MSEs into its own vertical search products, to the detriment of OTAs and MSEs. For instance, when a user searches for a hotel in Brussels, Google automatically displays its \u201cHotel search unit\u201d, a box with hotel listings that when clicked on leads the user to Google\u2019s hotel vertical, i.e Google\u2019s Hotel Finder. The Hotel search unit is prominently featured on Google\u2019s search engine results page (\u201cSERP\u201d) with a rich and attractive display format, setting it apart from rival verticals displayed significantly further down the page, below \u201cthe fold\u201d, despite the fact that these rivals are highly ranked organic results. Over the years, the Hotel search unit has captured an increasingly large portion of the SERP, pushing organic results ever further down the page (and below the fold). If the search is conducted on a mobile device, as is commonly the case (at trivago, the revenue share from mobile websites and apps exceeded 60% in 2019), screen size is limited. In this case, the Hotel search unit will typically push organic results down so far that the user will have to scroll down to find them. Yet the average user rarely scrolls down the SERP.","1046":"The result is that MSEs receive increasingly less traffic from organic results. In order to make up for the loss of organic traffic, they are forced to increase their ad spend with Google (either in the form of traditional Search Engine Marketing or in the form of Hotel Ads), which in turn increases their cost of customer acquisition, increases distribution costs and squeezes their margins. ","1047":"Even when a user clicks on a listing displayed within the Hotel search unit, Google interposes itself between the OTA or MSE whose listing is clicked on and its customers. When a user clicks on a listing in the Hotel search unit display, he is referred to Google\u2019s Hotel Finder vertical, not to the OTA or MSE whose listing he selected. The user then inputs her search details into Google\u2019s Hotel Finder (e.g., dates, star rating, budget, services such as Wi-Fi). In effect, the Hotel search unit that is displayed on the SERP is a \u201cbait and switch\u201d \u2013 the user thinks that he will be taken to the listing he clicks on, but in fact, regardless of the listing on which he clicks, he is taken to Google\u00b4s Hotel Finder page. ","1048":"Google then displays the offers made by OTAs, MSEs and hotels that have participated in the auction run by Google to populate its Hotel Finder results page (which shows the screen the user sees when it clicks on one of the hotels listed). Only then will the customer be able to choose an OTA or MSE to complete her booking.","1049":"Consumers are, as a result, pushed further down Google\u2019s purchasing funnel before they can interact with the MSE and are funneled into clicking on Google\u2019s hotel, vacation rental or flights listing box on the SERP. The consumer is then referred to Google\u2019s own vertical search page where she has to repeat her search, this time including the information necessary to produce relevant results (like travel dates, hotel amenities, star rating, price band). The only way that OTAs and MSEs are made visible to the consumer is on the price dropdown for the listings.  Even then, the hotel, OTAs and MSEs are listed in the order that generates the highest income for Google (through the auction that it runs), not the best option for the consumer. Moreover this reduces, if not eliminates, the ability of OTAs or MSEs to differentiate themselves other than on price, stifling innovation and disincentivising investments in quality, thereby harming consumers.  They are at a particular disadvantage because, even if they make significant investments in their product to offer superior search results compared to Google in terms of price, quality or selection or other characteristics that would benefit consumers, Google is able to nevertheless use its market position to direct users to its own potentially inferior results to increase its own monetization. At the same time, MSEs have to pay significant amounts to be displayed in Google\u2019s Hotel Finder results even while Google\u2019s Hotel Finder relies on the data of OTA\u2019s and MSE\u2019s for its own product.See responses to questions 7.1 and 7.3.See responses to questions 7.1 and 7.3.We believe that, while competition law undoubtedly is an important tool in preserving the contestability of markets, relying on competition law alone is no longer a sustainable solution for the structural competition issues described herein. We believe that existing ex post enforcement should be complemented by ex ante rules. ","1050":"\u2022\tPreferencing: This occurs when a platform operator preferences another of its own services.  It can take a number of forms: (i) diverting traffic away from the brand explicitly searched for (as Google does when it conducts brand search abuse) and (ii) the prominent placement of the providers services (as Google does with its travel (and others) boxes on the SERP, where those boxes contain \u201cbait and switch\u201d links that take the user to Google\u2019s travel service rather than to a listing for the property the user clicked on). In effect, Google is both (i) preferencing its own competing service and (ii) compelling rivals to participate in its paid services by \u201cdiscounting\u201d their highly ranked organic results (i.e., by conducting the brand search abuse described above).","1051":"\u2022\tUnfairly collecting and using data provided by rivals or produced in connection with rivals\u2019 services: This can either take the form of using data provided to the digital platform operator by a business in the platform provider\u2019s own competing business (e.g., Google\u2019s appropriation of competitors\u2019 real-time hotel data feed (providing inventory and pricing) to populate its Hotel Finder service) or use of the platform to collect information generated by users interacting with a third party\u2019s service (e.g., the collection of information about a use, including in-app purchasing) by Google).

That is the case when one user group (typically consumers) single-homes, to the effect that the other user group (typically businesses) relies on each platform with single-homing consumers to reach those single-homers.

This reflects the \u201chorizontal\u201d or \u201cconglomerate\u201d nature of the digital platforms in question. Indeed, there is a valid argument that the digital platforms posing most risk to competition are those that, by virtue of their systemic position, access to resources or competitively relevant data are able to swiftly and effectively expand into adjacent or related markets.

In addition, case law on new forms of abuse (such as self-preferencing, or \u201cbranded search abuse\u201d) does not exist, making it difficult if not impossible not only for the enforcer but also market participants to rely on these rules. ","1060":"Once a decision is rendered, it takes far too long for it to be implemented, and often such implementation is not an effective remedy.

See response to question 24.1 and 9.1","1061":"Hotels, restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s see digital and tech innovation as an opportunity to better connect with their guests and provide improved services. Hospitality establishments are trialing and selectively rolling out digital innovations to provide a more personalized and interactive experience for guests, such as online room or table selection through booking apps, mobile check-in and check-out with digital payment, mobile key technology and personalized smart cards for gathering customer preferences and the deployment of \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (\u201cIoT\u201d) technology in \u201csmart rooms\u201d.","1062":"Hospitality establishments are also investing in and rolling out new technologies at an unprecedented rate in order to welcome back guests safely and with social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., digital menus, chatbots, touchless digital menu systems, virtual TV remote control and apps for inventory management systems at pools and beaches for resorts).","1063":"Hospitality establishments are also mobilising digital innovation to achieve sustainability in the sector, for instance with the possibilities opened up by smart-building (e.g., optimization of heating and ventilation, management of reductions in electricity consumption, maximization of building security, smart sensors for lighting and control of appliances from remote location).The provision of digital services is not the core business of hospitality establishments. However, like in many sectors, the websites of hospitality establishment are an essential 'shop window' in the digital sphere and a strong share of reservations and bookings are made via digital platforms. When it comes to hotel reservations, more than half of all European travel bookings were made online in 2019. ","1064":"Further digital innovations have the potential to support the core business of hospitality establishments and provide guests with an enhanced experience.Hospitality establishments are very dependent on online platforms, which consumers use to find, compare offers and make reservations. There is an online ecosystem bringing together search engines (e.g. Google), specialised meta-search engines (e.g. Trivago, Tripadvisor, KAYAK) and booking platforms (e.g. Booking.com; TheFork). \nCompetition concerns which are relevance for this consultation response first and foremost affect the hotel sector. However we urge the European Commission to also closely follow the evolution of the online market for restaurant reservations and search functions to avoid the errors of the past which are affecting the hotel industry today. \nAs one of the most digitalized sectors, the hotel industry has become heavily intermediated over time by a handful of powerful \u2018online travel agents\u2019 (\u201cOTAs\u201d) which enjoy very significant and increasing bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis business users (hotels) for whom OTAs have become unavoidable trading partners. \nAccording to the company's research conducted in collaboration with HES-SO Valais School of Management, almost 30% of hotel bookings in 2019 were made via OTA platforms. \nThe 3 main players within the OTA market remain Booking Holding, Expedia Group and to a lesser extent HRS, with an aggregated market share of 92%. Booking.com is by far the most influential player, with a share of 68.4% in the OTA market. The dominance of Booking.com has been rising over the last 6 years by more than 8%, from 60.0% in 2013 to 68.4% in 2019. Expedia could maintain its market shares during the last 4 years (16.3% in 2019, compared with 16,6% in 2017 and 16,8% in 2015). HRS has seen a steady decrease of market shares, from 16.6% in 2013 to 7.2% in 2019.\nThe imbalance of bargaining power between these large online platforms and hotels is of prime concern, enabling OTAs to behave unilaterally in a way that is unfair and harmful to the legitimate interests of hotels and consumers in the EU. \nIt should also be noted that these OTAs are vertically integrated, with meta-search engines under the ownership of the same holdings as the OTAs. Booking.com owns and operates KAYAK, Mamondo, and HotelsCombined; while Expedia owns a majority share in Trivago. \nThe hotel industry has been hit extremely hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to increase its reliance upon two established online platforms (Booking.com and Expedia).A: Two platforms (Booking.com and Expedia) control over 85% of the OTA hotel booking market. Acquisitions of competing OTAs (horizontal integration), which were shut down and online traffic directed to the leaders\u2019 eponymous websites, eliminating competition and reducing consumer choice: Booking.com owns and operates booking.com, agoda, priceline.com, rocketmiles, travelweb; while Expedia owns and operates expedia.com, hotels.com, hotwire.com, Orbitz (including their brands CheapTickets and ebookers), TraveloCity and Wotif; both Booking.com and Expedia also acquired other smaller OTAs that no longer operate as independent platforms\nB: The above-mentioned OTAs own meta-search engines. Booking.com owns and operates KAYAK, Mamondo, and HotelsCombined; while Expedia owns a majority share in Trivago. \nC, D, J, K, L , M, P: OTAs are associated with large network effects, whereby they become increasingly strong vis-\u00e0-vis their rivals as the size of the user base on each side of the platform increases (i.e., consumers typically are drawn to the platforms where they can find the greatest choice of hotels, and hotels typically want to use the platforms on which they are exposed to the greatest number of consumers); the presence of these network effects, and potentially some economies of scope and scale to distribute hotel rooms at lower operational costs, create effective barriers to entry. \nOTAs offer loyalty and personalization programs (achieved with the help of previously acquired personal data) whereby customers can benefit from additional discounts (ultimately paid for by hotels), preferential deals, lower modification and cancellation fees and the ability to purchase ancillary services which generate switching costs and means that entrant OTAs, which do not have the same scale or deep pockets as established OTAs, are unable to effectively compete for customers; these \u201clock-in\u201d strategies are further strengthened by the recognized cognitive cost for consumers in switching platforms, in terms of time, effort, energy and the concentration. \nI, Q: OTAs accumulate considerable, valuable and diverse data (both individual customer identification and performance data as well as market data); this vast amount of data is paired with the scale and capital required to profitably invest in the development of analytical tools (e.g., AI algorithms, deep learning and computing powers) needed to process, interpret and monetize such data in order to anticipate their customers\u2019 needs and influence their conduct (through more targeted offers, outreach to consumers that may not be served otherwise) and to control a large portion of the customer relationship. \nFinally, OTAs have a structural impact on the sector through conglomerate strategies giving them control over entire \u2018ecosystems\u2019 of adjacent markets; over time, OTAs have been able to leverage their significant assets (data and financial clout) to preempt potential competition and to enter new business lines.As explained above, the online hotel distribution has been controlled by a duopoly of two leading platforms for several years.  Each of Booking.com and Expedia holds significant bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis their business users. This has led to serious structural competition and other issues that the existing regulatory and competition framework cannot tackle or effectively address, resulting in several regulatory and enforcement gaps.\nOTAs have a structural impact on the sector through conglomerate strategies giving them control over entire \u2018ecosystems\u2019 of adjacent markets; over time, OTAs have been able to leverage their significant assets (data and finances) to preempt potential competition and to enter new business lines. \nPlease see above responses highlighting the acquisition strategies of OTAs.The strategies implemented by OTAs tend towards strong horizontal and vertical concentration and further hamper hospitality establishments' capacity to handle their own distribution channels independently.The European Commission should intervene imposing behavioral and structural remedies on both OTAs (without requiring the finding of a dominant position) that would take into account the fact that the structural competition issues result from a variety of interwoven factors (structural and behavioral) creating competition concerns that are market-wide.  In this regard, European Commission intervention via a New Competition Tool should complement standard competition law and the suggested ex ante regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act.The unbalanced bargaining power between Booking.com and Expedia, on the one hand, and hotels on the other hand, has resulted in large-scale unfair trading and anticompetitive practices that hurt hotels and consumers in Europe. Unfortunately, the experience of the hotel industry is that standard EU competition law has not proved adequate to address these issues, resulting in serious regulatory and enforcement gaps. \nThe potential entry of other Big Tech operators (such as Google, Amazon or Facebook) in online hotel distribution raises significant risks for competition that should be properly anticipated by regulators and enforcement authorities.We experience anti-competitive monopolisation strategies in the hotel OTA sector.When booking through online travel agents, and thus establishing a contract between the consumer and the service provider e.g. the hotel, communication between the hotel and the guest is managed indirectly, by the online platform. With this practice, platforms restrict access to, and the use of, personal and non-personal data, including that which are directly generated by a company\u2019s activities on the platform. ","1065":"Platforms are thus monopolising \/ holding-back the relationship between the establishment and its customer and are unduly burdening the access to such data, which would be valuable for the further development of the services. Furthermore, the fact that there is a third party \u2018reading\u2019 the correspondence is reducing the incentive for communication both on the side of the guests as well as the establishment, thus deterring the further improvement of the quality of the final services. The relationship in the world of hospitality, which is based on trust, service, and empathy cannot be achieved through a non-personal e-mail. A hotel needs a free and direct communication channel with its guest \u2013 in digital as well as in analogue times. ","1066":"Access to and use of data generated in relation to a service provider\u2019s business activity is getting more and more valuable. Businesses should have direct access to such data and access to such data must not be hindered by online platforms. In fact, the direct communication between the consumers and the service providers shall be restored.OTAs financial power and capacity to generate and leverage data enables them to engage in a variety of abuses and unfair practices (e.g., excessive pricing, imposition of anti-competitive terms of service, foreclosure of smaller rivals\/entrants, and misleading advertising that diverts online traffic and further entrenches them competitively).Expedia was founded in 1996 and Booking.com in 1998. They are no longer \u201cstart-ups\u201d heralding new business models and innovation, but global giants that have come to control entire online ecosystems.  \nThey do not bear any significant commercial and\/or financial risks in connection with the online distribution of hotel rooms. Their investments and long-term spending commitments are amply sunk (massive SEA\/advertising spending are operating expenses that can easily be reduced\/stopped it they do not generate the desired returns).  Their business model\u2019s contribution to innovation is today very limited and relies mainly on protecting entrenched (profitable) positions and unfairly monopolizing value in the distribution chain.\nThese strategies lock-in both business partners and consumers.","1067":"Although Booking.com and Expedia may appear to compete aggressively with each other, their oligopolistic interdependence is real; indeed, it is difficult for a hotel to negotiate commercial concessions with one of these platforms unless it can give assurances that the same concessions will be obtained from the other. \nThe two leading hotel booking OTAs have been able to simultaneously impose wide and narrow parity clauses (or most-favored nation, \u201cMFN\u201d clauses) to a significant fraction of hotel operators in Europe (both independents and chains), which effectively prevent hotels from offering better prices, conditions and availabilities to consumers online. \nWide parity clauses have been prohibited or abandoned in most jurisdictions in Europe; however they had been in place for so long that, to a large extent, \u201cthe harm is done\u201d since OTAs have been able to build high barriers to entry; in addition the prohibition on wide parity clauses only (i.e., maintaining narrow parity clauses) could not (and have not) spurred competition among OTAs. \nNarrow parity clauses remain commonplace in the EU juridictions which have not banned these practices in the hotel OTA sector. As both major OTAs and others impose narrow price parity clauses on their hotel business partners, the end result is that hotel room prices are very similar from one platform to another and the hotels themselves must offer a price which is equal or higher. \nFurthermore, research shows that legal prohibition of narrow parity clauses might be de facto materially hindered by the OTAs\u2019 algorithmic power (i.e., hotels that do not grant the best prices, conditions and availabilities are de-ranked or \u201cdimmed\u201d by the OTAs\u2019 algorithms; and therefore hotels have no choice but to grant parity to OTAs).  Both Booking.com and Expedia have also implemented programs that boost the online visibility on their platforms of hotels that adhere to specific programs requiring price parity and room availability.The hotel OTA market is dominated by two major players who can both monitor each other's behaviour and pricing policies. They compete globally and typically offer the same hotel rooms and similar prices (a problem exacerbated by narrow MFNs). ","1068":"Parity clauses facilitate consumer \u201clock-in\u201d strategies (and single-homing) as consumers are not encouraged to use other platforms because OTAs guarantee that they offer the best prices and availabilities; this reinforces consumer inertia which in turn further entrenches OTAs\u2019 market positions.The hotel industry\u2019s experience is that digital markets are not necessarily only characterized by single company dominance but - particularly with the development of ecosystem models - by the presence of powerful actors acting in several markets making oligopolistic and tacit collusion scenarios more relevant.EU rulings on abuses of \u201ccollective dominance\u201d have tended to depend on findings that the undertakings in question either have some legal\/economic links to each other or appear on the market as a collective entity.  ","1069":"As a result, harms arising from tacit collusion and oligopolistic interdependence have proven to be difficult to remedy, even in traditional markets. In the digital economy, such problems are inevitably increased.  The potential for abuses is more real and imminent because online platform markets tend to become highly concentrated and platform users are readily placed in positions of dependence on the leaders.  Operators of the leading platforms then can exploit this commercial imbalance and significant market power in an interdependent way, given the transparency inherent in the operation of public websites. ","1070":"The company considers that a broader and more \u201cholistic\u201d approach focusing on a far wider set of competition concerns beyond explicit collusion and the abuse of dominance would be of relevance to specifically address the issues raised above.OTAs accumulate considerable, valuable and diverse data (both individual customer identification and performance data as well as market data); this vast amount of data is paired with the scale and capital required to profitably invest in the development of analytical tools (e.g., AI algorithms, deep learning and computing powers) needed to process, interpret and monetize such data in order to anticipate their customers\u2019 needs and influence their conduct (through more targeted offers, outreach to consumers that may not be served otherwise) and to control a large portion of the customer relationship.See previous replies: EU rulings on abuses of \u201ccollective dominance\u201d have tended to depend on findings that the undertakings in question either have some legal\/economic links to each other or appear on the market as a collective entity. From our experience, tacit collusion can occur without direct legal or economic links.We have no knowledge of the pricing algorithms used by OTAs. However we see that OTAs can easily compare prices among themselves given the inherent transparency of public websites. the imposition of narrow price parity clauses leads to a situation where prices might be aligned.","1071":"Parity clauses effectively prevent hotels from offering better prices, conditions and availabilities to consumers online; and lead to a de facto alignment of prices available via OTA platforms.There is clear evidence that the parity clauses unilaterally imposed by the OTAs constitute unfair trading practices, restrict competition and hurt consumers. Wide or narrow parity clauses (MFNs) in OTA agreements with business users  should be banned. ","1072":"Parity clauses have the potential of raising fees paid by hotels and harming consumers and facilitate consumer \u201clock-in\u201d strategies (and single-homing) as consumers are not encouraged to use other platforms because OTAs guarantee that they offer the best prices and availabilities; this reinforces consumer inertia which in turn further entrenches OTAs\u2019 market positions. ","1073":"\nHotel booking OTAs have been able to increase their bargaining power over the last decade by imposing unfair terms and trading practices, until the point where markets have \u201ctipped\u201d to their benefit. The existence of a duopoly in the market with one excessively strong player (68,4% market share of Booking.com) leads us to consider that the market has already tipped.The following characteristics have entrenched the market dominance:\n- imposition of parity clauses;\n- terms and practices to unfairly divert consumer attention and traffic (such as SEA and \/keyword bidding), massive spending on digital advertising, brand-bidding;\n- manipulating search results and rankings; \n- practices that harm consumers and reduce welfare (such as, higher advertising levels, more intrusive advertising, less attractive or relevant content offers);\n-  strong brand presence through massive brand marketing expenses;\n- control of entire digital conglomerates beyond their core markets that lock-in consumers and further entrench their positions as incumbents.Our experience shows that that the hotel OTA market has tipped. We would also draw attention as stated previously, there is also a risk of seeing further market tipping if the largest platforms such as Google, Amazon and Facebook enter the booking market, for all hospitality segments, including restaurant and caf\u00e9 reservation\/search functions.Today, hotel booking OTA business model's contribution to innovation is today very limited and relies mainly on protecting entrenched (profitable) positions and playing a gatekeeper role in the distribution chain.For markets that have already \u201ctipped\u201d, the New Competition Tool could be used to address structural absences of competition by imposing behavioral remedies (as a complement to the ex ante regulatory instrument);","1074":"For markets that display structural risks for competition (\u201ctipping\u201d markets), the New Competition Tool could provide for a graduated response based on recommendations to act in a specific way to avoid tipping; and only if recommendations do not prove sufficient, (behavioral \/ structural) remedies would be imposed.  For example, if Google is perceived as posing a credible threat to entry on the online hotel distribution market and, given its numerous competitive advantages, to \u201ctipping\u201d the market leading to anticompetitive outcomes, the new instrument could be activated to prevent harmful conduct from materializing.\nThe existing framework for EU competition law enforcement has in many instances shown itself adept at treating novel or complex issues. However, the enforcement experience in Europe also shows that standard competition law cannot be \u201cstretched\u201d indefinitely and has not been able to tackle all of these issues or has not been able to tackle them in the most effective manner.Our reply focuses on the online hotel booking market. However it is evident that gatekeeper scenarios are common in digital markets.","1075":"Beyond the high number of customers and potential lock-in effect for consumers, which are important, the most pressing issue across the hotel OTA booking sector is the fact that the platforms impose very similar terms and conditions to business partners. The combination of these three factors lead to a situation where hotels have no alternative to use these platforms and accept their conditions. They are as such 'unavoidable partners'. ","1076":"As such, the terms and conditions are unilaterally imposed by major platforms and hotels have no bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis the platforms. In addition, the use of 'penalties' such as de-ranking or dimming offers of hotels that attempt to act more independently or attempting to compete with the platform for sales or in connection with a contract negotiation or commercial dispute exacerbate the exercise of gatekeeper power. ","1077":"Hotel booking OTAs have gradually captured a large share of the total revenues of an entire \u201cecosystem\u201d and have become unavoidable trading partners for hotels to reach consumers online. As such, hotels have little choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by the OTAs.The European Commission should adopt a new and flexible ex ante regulatory framework for large online platforms acting as gatekeepers.Empirically, the power of gatekeeper platforms in the hotel OTA sector shows that the existing EU competition law framework is not sufficiently equipped to address the emergence of gatekeeper platforms.We refer to the above-mentioned structural competition problems we have identified in the OTA hotel booking market.Because there are a variety of interwoven factors (structural and behavioral) creating competition concerns that are market-wide, a more \u201cholistic\u201d analysis of markets is required.Competition authorities usually tend to focus more narrowly on one issue and (in abuse cases) one firm and also tend to focus on exclusionary practices, assuming that exploitative abuses would self-correct. This has not happened, and online hotel distribution is a case in point. \nWe believe that a more holistic approach is required to take a combination of factors into account. The current regulatory framework at the EU level does not yet specifically address the significant bargaining power that large online platforms acting as gatekeepers hold, in particular there are no meaningful protections against unfair trading practices in B2B relationships at the EU level.There is a broad range of unfair practices imposed by OTAs on hotels as a result of their gatekeeper power:\n- Imposing either wide or narrow parity clauses (MFNs) in their agreements with business users (as well as other practices that limit the visibility of the business users\u2019 own websites such as a ban on hotels\u2019 listing of guest loyalty program rates on metasearch)\n- Purposefully dimming or de-ranking specific business users as a penalty against a business user attempting to compete with the platform for sales or in connection with a contract negotiation or commercial dispute\n- Pre-emptive advertising designed to or resulting in one company or advertiser (including the sub-brands and sister companies belonging to the same group) occupying so many slots in paid search results that competitors\u2019 ads are crowded out; \n- Pricing paid search advertisements based on trademarked keywords in a way that enables other online platforms to regularly out-bid the trademark owners;\n- Making the provision of services subject to acceptance by the business users of other supplementary services (tying);\n- Using other parties\u2019 (e.g., sellers on their platform) commercially sensitive data for their own pricing, marketing, or competitive purposes.\nEmpirically, the exiting EU legal framework has not prevented unfair practices imposed by a duopoly of major OTA hotel booking platforms.See answer 22.2Webelieve that the New Competition Tool can offer solutions. \nDigitization and characteristics of digitalized markets (as well as unfair terms and practices) have created some specific structural competition issues in the online hotel distribution sector that cannot be addressed at all or effectively by existing tools. The online hotel distribution sector in Europe has been dominated for over a decade by a duopoly of OTAs (Booking.com and Expedia) and displays structural competition problems that have not been remedied and do not seem to be capable of being addressed in the foreseeable future under standard EU competition laws.\nThe Commission\u2019s Inception Impact Assessment provides that the New Competition Tool would allow the Commission to intervene in markets experiencing a structural lack of competition (the market has \u201ctipped\u201d and as a result is not working well and not delivering a competitive structure due to its configuration) or structural risks for competition (the market is \u201ctipping\u201d and early intervention could prevent the emergence of powerful market players with an entrenched and\/or gatekeeper position). \nWe consider that the New Competition Tool should allow the Commission to intervene by imposing behavioral and\/or structural remedies on both OTAs (without requiring the finding of a dominant position) that would take into account the fact that the structural competition issues result from a variety of interwoven factors (structural and behavioral) creating competition concerns that are market-wide.  In this regard, we see the new instrument as a valuable complement to standard competition law and the suggested ex ante regulatory instrument.\nThe instrument could also prove extremely helpful to ensure that the rise of other major platforms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon operating in online hotel distribution does not result in the market \u201ctipping\u201d in favor of another set of \u201cgatekeepers\u201d with significant market power. The New Competition Tool could therefore be used to prevent the repetition of past regulatory failures.","1078":"We believe that the New Competition Tool should be narrow in scope and subject to appropriate checks and balances in view of the significant expansion of the Commission\u2019s powers the instrument would represent. We believe that hospitality reservation markets should be addressed by this tool.We would recommend staying as close as possible to established concepts in EU competition law, while taking into account the key specificities of digital markets to which the New Competition Tool would apply. In line with existing competition rules and long-standing case-law, remedies imposed through the New Competition Tool should be strictly necessary, proportionate, properly designed and capable of specifically addressing any perceived competition issues on digital markets.It should be noted that the New Competition Tool might be a valuable complementary tool to the ex ante regulatory instrument in at least two substantive areas where there is a potential gap in the Commission\u2019s proposals for ex ante regulation, and which the New Competition Tool could usefully fill:","1079":"- The power to impose structural remedies;\n- The need for market-wide intervention to promote competition (the ex ante regulation would only apply to \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platforms, but in some instances, interventions may be best applied to all firms across a market; this may provide a valuable role for the New Competition Tool); \n- In online hotel distribution, if the ex ante regulatory instrument were to prohibit all forms of (wide and narrow) MFNs when applied by \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platforms (\u201cblacklist\u201d under Option 3a), the Commission could consider it appropriate to extend this prohibition to other (non \u201cgatekeeper\u201d) platforms through the New Competition Tool .The New Competition Tool should allow for an extensive range of remedies, from recommendations to market participants to the imposition of more specific behavioral or even, in specific circumstances, structural remedies. These remedies (or packages of remedies) should be designed depending on the nature and magnitude of the structural competitive issues (with higher standards required for the stricter remedies) and of the market operators, with due consideration to the complex set of drivers for the issues arising in many digital platform markets.","1080":"Divestment of assets could be considered as part of remedies requiring some form of structural change on the part of the party or parties to whom the measures are directed.The enforcement of a New Competition Tool implies appropriate power for an enforcement authority to initiate and conduct investigations upon own initiative or on the basis of a complaint (by operators or trade associations). \n- the power to require gatekeeper platforms to provide all necessary data and information in order to conduct investigations of prohibited trading practices; this should include monitoring powers (such as regular reporting from the gatekeeper platform);\n-The enforcement authority should be in a position to set deadlines, which is all the more important because of the speed and dynamics of digital markets.Interim measures may be necessary to prevent clearly unfair practices and dominance which create irreparable harm during the investigation.Voluntary commitments should be possible but their implementation should be carefully monitored and failure to live up to voluntary commitments should be strongly penalized.Suppliers and customers of hotel booking platforms should have the possibility to comment of findings and provide suggestions to ensure effective remedies.We believe that consultation of relevant suppliers would support an approach whereby remedies are strictly necessary, proportionate, properly designed and capable of specifically addressing any perceived competition issues on digital markets.","1081":"As pointed out throughout this submission, the hotel industry\u2019s experience is that digital markets are not necessarily only characterized by single company dominance but - particularly with the development of ecosystem models - by the presence of powerful actors acting in several markets making oligopolistic and tacit collusion scenarios more relevant. There are also risks of new forms of market tipping scenarios with the emergence of the largest tech players into the market.","1082":"MTK is an independent association.

","1089":"The  current  proposal  would  confer  on  the  Commission  powers  that  are significantly \nmore  interventionist  in  the  economy  than  the  ability  to  impose  fines  or  prohibit  a \nprospective  merger.  We  respectfully  submit  that  the  Commission  should  clearly \ndefine  the  circumstances  in  which  it  is  unable  to  act  (or  can  only  act  when  it  is  too \nlate) with the tools that it has today, especially if those tools are to be complemented \nby  targeted  ex  ante  regulation  under  the  DSA  (which  would  need  to  be  scrutinised \nalso). ","1090":"From the list of situations the Commission seeks to tackle with the NCT,4 it appears \nthat  the  existing  competition  rules  are  sufficiently  flexible  to  cover  most  of  them  (or \nwill be sufficient once updated further in the context of globalisation and digitisation, \nin  particular  with  regard  to  the  ongoing  reviews  of  the  Horizontal  and  Vertical \nGuidelines  and  Notice  on  Market  Definition).    There  are  a  range  of  ways  in  which \nthey can be employed to capture attempts at monopolisation by gatekeeper platforms, \ntacit  collusion,  and  even  problematic  unilateral  conduct  of  non-dominant companies \nin a dynamic analysis.  ","1091":"Articles  102  TFEU  and  the  EU  Merger  Regulation  (hereafter  \u2018EUMR\u2019)  have \nbeen  interpreted  broadly  to  capture  competition  problems  caused  by \noligopolies.  The  Airtours  case  lays  down  very  specific  conditions  for  the \nfinding  of  collective  dominance:  (i)  each member  of  the  oligopoly  must  know \nhow  the  other  members  are  behaving  in  order  to  adopt  the  same  policy \n(monitoring mechanism); (ii) there must be a deterrence mechanism allowing \nfirms  to  sustain  collusion;  and  (iii)  customers  and  competitors  must  not  be \nable to jeopardise the collusion.5  Other judgments (Irish Sugar6, Compagnie \nMaritime  Belge 7 )  have  aligned  the  102  and  EUMR  tests,  clarifying  that \nstructural  links  between  the  parties  are  not  necessary  for  a  finding  of \ncollective dominance. ","1092":"There  is  nothing  preventing  the  Commission  from  developing  its  analysis  of \nforeclosure incentives under Article 102 TFEU by drawing on its conglomerate \neffects analysis in the merger review context.8  In fact, it may be helpful for the \nCommission  to  update  its  Article  102  Enforcement  Priorities  Guidelines  to \naddress this and certain other issues not currently covered. ","1093":"Competition  law  intervention  that  tries  to  prevent  the  emergence  of  future  market \nplayers with some sort of entrenched or gatekeeper function, where competition is for \nthe  market  rather  than  in  the  market,  may  change  incentives  and  deter  disruptive \ninnovation. It is highly speculative to try to diagnose the likely causes of a predicted \ntipping  that  would  be  sufficiently  problematic  to  justify  intrusive  public  intervention \nand to do so in a proportionate way.  ","1094":"4 Situations  listed  are:  markets  where  structural  competition  problems  may  arise  due  to  repeated  strategies  by  companies \nwith market power to extend their market position into related markets, oligopolistic markets prone to tacit collusion in order \nto  preserve\/improve  competition,  markets  where  structural  competition  problems  may  arise  due  to  anti-competitive \nmonopolisation,  markets  where  pricing  algorithms  are  prevalent,  markets  where  there  is  a  risk  of  tipping,  markets \ncharacterised by 'gatekeeper' platforms. \n5 Case T-342\/99 Airtours plc v.

","1095":"Sector Inquiries: where the trend of trade between Member States, the rigidity \nof prices or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or \ndistorted (Article 17 of Regulation 1\/2003).  Sector inquiries can be employed \nin  a  more  targeted  and  nimble  way  and  are  more  proportionate  in  terms  of \ntheir  potential  consequences  where  market  failures  or  inefficiencies  are \nsuspected; ","1096":"To address competition problems in a timely and effective manner (one of the stated \npurposes  of  the  NCT),  the  Commission  may  employ  the  considerable  armoury  it \nalready  has  available  to  it.  It  is  able  to  ask  questions  to  understand  better  how \npotentially  problematic  or  fast-moving  markets  are  developing,  to  open  more  cases \nand  to  test  new  theories  of  harm  and  should  demonstrate  a  willingness  to  close \ninvestigations at an early stage when it transpires that there is no credible theory of \nmaterial  harm,  and  consider  how  to  publicly  share  the  learnings  of  such  case \nclosures [this point seeks to address the fact that we need more guidance in 101 and \n102 cases]. ","1097":"There  is  nothing  to  prevent  the  Commission  from  testing  the  law  before  the  courts \nwith  punctual  decisions  that  target  specific  harmful  conduct  which  constitutes  an \ninfringement of Articles 101 or 102 TFEU. Together with setting internal deadlines to \nclose  proceedings  within  a  reasonable  timeframe,  more  targeted  decisions  (formal \nand  informal)  decision  (and  guidance)  could  achieve  the  objective  of  more  timely \ninterventions.   ","1098":"Article 103 TFEU does not appear to be an adequate legal basis because the NCT is \nnot  intended  to  give  effect  to  the  principles  set  out  in  Articles  101  and  102  of  the \nTFEU but rather creates new competition enforcement powers that go beyond these \nprinciples.  It  will  be  applied  in  ex  ante  intervention  that  is  not  necessarily  related  to \neither the behaviour (misconduct) of the targeted company or any infringement by a \nfirm that enjoys a dominant position in any given market which are the basis of any \napplication of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.  ","1099":"Article 114 TFEU is the legal basis for the Commission to propose any legislative tool \naimed  at  harmonising  law  across  Member  States  in order to avoid  fragmentation  of \nthe  internal  market.  However,  according  to  the  Roadmap,  the  purpose  of  a  NCT  is \nnot  to  remove  distortions  of  competition  law  but  rather  to  eliminate  structural  risks \nand deficits that are below the thresholds of competition law. The need to harmonise \nnational  competition  laws,  consumer  protection  laws,  or  sectorial  regulations  would \nhave to be demonstrated to justify the NCT. ","1100":"A more appropriate legal basis would appear to be Article 352 TFEU (the \u201cflexibility \nclause\u201d)  for  cases  when  \u201caction  by  the  Union  should  prove  necessary,  within  the \nframework  of the  policies  defined in the  Treaties,  to  attain one of the  objectives  set \nout  in  the  Treaties\u201d,  which  requires  unanimity  of  the  Council  and  European \nParliament\u2019s  consent.    Such  Article  shows  how  new  Union  powers  require  Member \nState support as well as democratic involvement.9 ","1101":"9 See also the Protocol (No 27) on the internal market and competition: \u201cThe High Contracting Parties, considering that the \ninternal market as set out in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union includes a system ensuring that competition is not \ndistorted, have agreed that: to this end, the Union shall, if necessary, take action under the provisions of the Treaties, \nincluding under Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u201d. ","1102":"Competition  law  driven  regulatory  provisions  are  also  embedded  in  EU  regulations \ncovering other sectors of the economy (e.g. gas, power, telecoms, railway transport, \nfinancial  and  postal  services,  etc.),  where,  for  example,  unbundling  and  third  party \naccess regimes have been set in place to address concerns similar to some of those \ncharacterising new markets. ","1103":"In  those  sectors,  DG  COMP  and  other  competition  authorities  can  and  do  make \nrecommendations  to  regulators  or  legislators  to  address  concerns.    This  was \nessentially  the  conclusion  reached  by  the  UK  CMA  in relation to  its  probe  of  digital \nadvertising.    Despite  considerable  experience  with  and  pride  in  its  tool,  the  CMA \ndeclined  to  make  a  reference  for  a  market  inquiry  and  preferred  to  make \nrecommendations to the Government on a regulatory reform (para 89 final report).  ","1104":"Ex  ante  regulations  can  be  enacted  for  a  period  and  adjusted  to  reflect  market \ndevelopments  with  due  legislative  scrutiny  and  democratic  legitimacy.  The  EU \nregulatory  framework  for  electronic  communications,  the  Open  Internet  Regulation, \nthe  Platform-to-Business  (P2B)  Regulation,  the  Digital  Content  Directive  and  the \nrevised  Payment  Services  Directive  (PSD2)  are  examples  of  regulation  to  tackle \nindirect  network  effects,  customer  acquiescence,  information  asymmetries  and \nvarying levels of dependency on key players.   ","1105":"The NCT would possibly overlap significantly with the DSA, in particular with respect \nto  addressing  concerns  around  gatekeepers  and  tipping.    If  the  proposed    DSA \nPackage,  were  enacted,  this  new  legislative  tool  would    tackle  market  failures  to \nensure  that  the  key  concern  identified  to  date  by  the  Commission  of  markets \ncharacterised  by \nlarge  platforms  with  significant  network  effects  acting  as \ngatekeepers remain fair and contestable for innovators, businesses, and new market \nentrants. ","1106":"Targeted  regulation  is  often  a  more  appropriate  solution  in  some  circumstances, \ncoupled  with  the  application  of  the  existing  competition  rules,  which  still  have  the \nscope  to  evolve  (for  example  in  terms  of  extending  the  consideration  of  benefits  to \nconsumers in sustainability cooperations beyond focus on consumer prices) and in a \nmore  timely  way.  The  need for  an  NCT should only  be  assessed  if  an enforcement \ngap  is  clearly  established  in  relation  to  the  abusive  practices  of  hyper-  or  super- \nscalers \/ super dominant players in the digital arena.  ","1107":"As  to  other  markets  and  sectors  (including  oligopolistic  market  structures),  ERT \nconsiders  that  the  existing  competition  law  framework,  and  specific  sectoral \nregulation  when  needed,  have  proven  to  be  sufficient  to  address  any  potential \ncompetition issues. ERT also recalls that for European players to remain competitive \non a global scale, it is important to avoid the chilling effects of adding extra layers of \nregulatory scrutiny on top of the already existing rules.   ","1108":"DG COMP cannot act as inquisitor, judge and jury in any NCT process.  The Court of \nJustice\u2019s full judicial review is what makes the current EU system compliant with \nfundamental rights (KME Germany, Chalkor, Galp).  If an NCT were to be adapted, \nrobust checks and balances would be fundamental to its legitimacy, which would \nrequire substantial changes to the institutional structure of EU competition \nenforcement. ","1109":"The UK MI  tool  embodies  strong  governance provisions  with  numerous checks  and \nbalances.  It is triggered either by a reference from a limited set of external bodies, or \nfollowing  an  own  initiative  study  by  the  CMA.    This  market  study  phase  is  itself  a \nburdensome  exercise  for  the  authority,  such  that  embarking  on  any  subsequent \ninvestigation is a serious undertaking. ","1110":"The  UK  rules  provide  for  a  highly  transparent  process,  with  the  possibility  for \ncompanies  in  the  targeted  market(s)  to  express  their  views  throughout  the  whole \nprocess.  The UK MI tool sets out a continuous dialogue between the affected firms \nand \nthe  CMA,  mainly  by  means  of  formal  hearings,  published  preliminary \nconclusions\/proposed  remedies  which  the  affected  parties  can  comment  on    and \nremedies hearings when the Market Study turns to a Market Reference.  ","1111":"A proportionate remedy is one that:  (a) is effective in achieving its legitimate \naim;  (b)  is  no  more  onerous  than  needed  to  achieve  its  aim;  (c)  is  the  least \nonerous if there is a choice between several effective measures; and (d) does \nnot produce disadvantages which are disproportionate to the aim. ","1112":"The CMA has concurrent competition law and consumer protection law powers that \nposition  it  better  to take full  account  not  only  of regulatory  and structural issues  but \nalso of consumer behavioural factors, privacy concerns and issues of fairness.  Many \nmarket  investigations  in the  UK  result  in recommendations  to government  or  sector \nregulators  to  change  the  law  or  adapt  regulation  or  how  it  is  enforced  rather  than \nspecific  remedies.    In  addition,  the  UK  has  a  system  of  concurrency  between  the \nCMA and these sector regulators that allow the latter to monitor and enforce any MI \nremedies.    Sector-specific  regulators  are  better  placed  to  adjust  remedies  to  fast-\nchanging markets and to ensure adequate enforcement.  These important attributes \nare not present at EU level.11   ","1113":"These  unique  aspects  of  the  UK  MI  (two-stage  process,  transparency,  difficulty  of \nlaw \ndevising  a  remedy  within  the \njurisdiction)  and  the  limitations  of  DG  COMP  acting  as  a  de  facto  regulator  in \nmonitoring and enforcing remedies, show that there is no basis for the introduction of \nan NCT at EU level with a broad intervention scope. ","1114":"7.2  Most  countries  around  the  world  rightfully  look  to  the  EU  competition  regime  as  a \nmodel to emulate.  Should the EU enact the NCT, there is a real risk of a proliferation \nof  such  instruments  that,  in  turn,  will  significantly  increase  the  politicisation  of  the \ncompetition  rules  around  the  world.    The  potential  for  regulatory  drag  on  global \nmarkets will increase exponentially.  ","1115":"8.1  Only if it is established that the combination of the review of the current competition \ntoolbox  adapted  to  the  digital  economy  together  with  a  potential  sector  specific \nframework established by the DSA is likely to be materially insufficient, a limited NCT \nshould only be a solution to address misconduct of hyper- or super-scalers \/ super-\ndominant gatekeeper platforms that threaten structural harm. ","1116":"9.3  Quick but targeted enforcement against abusive practices of hyper- or super- scalers \n\/  super-dominant  gatekeepers  via  an  NCT  (where  it  has  been  clearly  identified  that \nthe current  competition  rules are  not  adequate  in terms  of  powers  or timing)  should \nonly be implemented to the extent an enforcement gap is clearly established subject \nto any proposed DSA ex ante regulation, and subject to two critical caveats: (i) that \nappropriate  procedural  safeguards  are  built  in,  and  (ii)  that  the  new  rules  do  not \nintroduce legal uncertainty in the broader economy.

Moreover,  we  study \nthe digital rights management (DRM) measures employed by those retailers \nand question the necessity to build up additional walls between the ecosys-\ntems  with  the  help  of  such  measures.  In  the  process,  we  will  also  address \nthe challenge to protect intellectual property adequately across ebook eco-\nsystems. And we evaluate the potential of the proposal for a common ebook \nformat standard covering multimedia and interactivity features, EPUB 3 (as \nproposed  by  the  IDPF  in  October  2011),  and  also  dwell  on  interoperable \noptions regarding the DRM protection of intellectual property.","1133":"Major players in the ebook market, especially Amazon or Apple, have built \nup closed ebook ecosystems in the last few years. eBooks that are distributed \nvia one of these ecosystems are formatted using ecosystem-specific ebook \nformats like KF8 (Amazon) or Fixed Layout EPUB\/.ibooks (Apple). As well \nas using incompatible ebook formats, Apple and Amazon fence their eco-\nsystems with the help of DRM measures of various kinds. These measures \nprohibit the export and import of files to and from other ecosystems. Some \nof these measures are restrictive software-based methods using encryption. \nThus,  ebooks  can  only  be  read  on  ecosystem-specific  end-user  devices  (or \nreader applications) such as the Kindle readers (in the case of the Amazon \necosystem)  or  iPads  or  iBooks  (for  the  Apple  ecosystem).  The  transfer  of \nebooks from one ecosystem into another is not possible (or, at least, requires \nmeasures that are not legal).","1134":"\fTherefore, we cannot see a technological or functional reason to go on \nusing proprietary ebook formats. A possible move from proprietary ebook \nformats to EPUB 3 on the side of Amazon and Apple would be facilitated \nby the fact that all formats have a common predecessor, namely EPUB 2 \n(from 2007 on). KF8, Fixed Layout EPUB, and .ibooks do not only share \nthe  underlying  basic  concepts  for  ebook  production  and  distribution \nwith EPUB 3, but also parts of the data structures. Moreover, Apple was \nactively engaged in the definition of the EPUB 3 standard; with Amazon\u2019s \nKF8, it can be observed that more recent versions converge with EPUB 3 \nwith respect to a growing number of features.","1135":"2.  Digital Rights Management Measures: The general use of EPUB 3 as an \ninteroperable ebook format would not in itself lead to full interoperability \nof ebooks for customers. The reason for that is that Apple and Amazon \nadditionally fence their ecosystems with the help of DRM measures of \ndifferent types and robustness. To overcome some of these obstacles to \nfull  interoperability,  unilateral  decisions  of  the  enterprises  in  question \nwould suffice, e.g.\u00a0by offering data file import and export on the inter-\nfaces of their reader applications. For others \u2013 software-based methods \nusing encryption, mostly at the request of the copyright holders \u2013 more \nfundamental  measures  would  have  to  be  taken,  including  multi-lateral \nagreements  on  using  compatible  or  identical  encryption  solutions,  e.g. \nopen (source) solutions. ","1136":"To sum up, there is no technical or functional reason not to use and establish \nEPUB 3 as an\/the interoperable (open) ebook format standard. One short-\nterm obstacle is the non-availability of reader applications able to display all \nEPUB 3 features. However, this problem should be fixed soon by the IDPF \nReadium initiative which is developing an open source reference system and \nrendering engine for EPUB 3. Given the will to do so on the side of Amazon \nand Apple, the DRM barrier between the ecosystems could be partly over-\ncome  by  simple  changes  to  the  respective  store  and  reader  applications, \nand partly only by more demanding agreements between different players \non  interoperable  DRM  solutions.  The  latter  is  only  necessary  if  copyright \nholders continue insisting on having their intellectual property protected by \nhighly restrictive measures.","1137":"\f1  Introduction\nMajor  players  in  the  ebook  market  like  Amazon  or  Apple  have  built  up \nclosed ecosystems for ebooks in the last few years. In such closed ecosystems, \nreaders can import ebooks or buy ebooks from the ebook stores available, \nbut  no  platform-independent  use  or  reading  of  ebooks  is  possible,  as  it  is \nimpossible or at least difficult to export ebooks. As well as the impossibility \nof exporting ebooks, other instruments for building up closed ecosystems \nare  a  tight  coupling  between  reading  devices  and  the  store,  proprietary \ndigital rights management (DRM) protection, and\/or the use of proprietary \nand  incompatible  ebook  formats.  Examples  of  ecosystem-specific  ebook \nformats are KF8 by Amazon or Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks by Apple.","1138":"Non-interoperable ebook formats cause various problems for customers as \nthe  making  available  and  reading  of  ebooks  becomes  ecosystem-specific. \nFor  example,  ebooks  that  are  provided  by  Amazon  can  only  be  read  and \nused on Amazon devices (and reading apps); analogously, reading an ebook \nfrom  Apple\u2019s  iBookstore  on  Amazon\u2019s  Kindle  reader  is  impossible  due  to \nthe  non-interoperability  of  the  formats.  The  transfer  of  ebooks  from  one \necosystem into another is not possible (or, at least, requires illegal measures) \nfor customers. Therefore, buying books in different ecosystems and viewing \nthem  with  the  same  reader  becomes  impossible.  The  existence  of  closed \necosystems in the ebook market also causes problems for local bookstores \nand other online retailers which deliver ebooks using interoperable formats. \nCustomers  with  Amazon\u2019s  Kindle  readers  can  only  read  ebooks  bought \nfrom the Amazon Kindle Store. Therefore, not only is there no free choice \nof online bookseller, but it is impossible to buy ebooks at local bookstores \nor  other  online  retailers  as  the  Kindle  reader  can  only  process  ebooks  in \nAmazon\u2019s KF8 format, which cannot be provided by the local bookseller or \nother online retailers.","1139":"Besides incompatible formats, ebook resellers use proprietary DRM meas-\nures to prohibit the free exchange of ebooks between different ecosystems \nand  to  protect  their  own  ecosystem.  Therefore,  ecosystem-specific  and \nproprietary  DRM  measures  have  the same  function  as incompatible  book \nformats  as  they  restrict  the  access  to  book  content  to  customers  of  one \necosystem. Given his\/her specific device, a customer can only buy ebooks \nthat are available in the ecosystem to which his\/her end-user device belongs. \nFor  example,  although  Apple  uses  an  interoperable  ebook  format  (EPUB) \nfor  some  of  its  content,  the  owner  of  an  Apple  reading  device  (e.g.\u00a0 iPad) \ncannot transfer his\/her DRM-protected ebooks from his\/her reading device \nto a non-Apple reading device, as Apple\u2019s DRM system (Apple FairPlay) is \nproprietary and does not allow the export of ebooks.","1140":"The existence of closed ecosystems is also an obstacle to the accessibility of \nebooks. As the content available in a particular ecosystem is only a subset \nof all available books, accessibility is limited to those books that are offered \nin the ecosystem to which a particular reader belongs. eBooks that are only ","1141":"\favailable in other ecosystems are not accessible by a reader. This is especially \nthe case for self-published books as the terms of use of some ebook stores \n(e.g.\u00a0 Amazon\u2019s  Kindle  Direct  Publishing  Program)  explicitly  forbid  an \nauthor to offer his\/her book at a different store for a limited period of time. \nA comparison of the Amazon and Apple ebook stores reveals that Amazon \noffers more ebooks than Apple, and the average prices of ebooks offered in \nthe Amazon Kindle Store are lower than in the Apple iBookstore. The price \ndifference illustrates the different choices offered by the two ebook stores. \nThe  higher  price  is  a  result  of  Apple\u2019s  strict  control  of  the  ebooks  offered \nin  its  store  and  its  stronger  focus  on  high-quality  and  graphic-oriented \nebooks. The incompatibility of the ecosystems limits the choice of ebooks \nfor  readers,  who  have  only  the  portfolio  of  the  ecosystems  to  which  their \nreader belongs at their disposal.","1142":"The European Union is aware of the problems arising from the non-interop-\nerability of formats. In pillar II of the Digital Agenda (interoperability and \nstandards), the European Commission calls for an \u201ceffective interoperability \nbetween  IT  products  and  services  to  build  a  truly  digital  society.  Europe \nmust ensure that new IT devices, applications, data repositories and services \ninteract seamlessly anywhere \u2013 just like the Internet.\u201d","1143":"The goal of this study is to examine the technical and functional possibilities \nof an interoperable \u201ccross-ecosystem\u201d ebook format. An obvious candidate \nfor such an interoperable format is EPUB 3, as proposed by the International \nDigital Publishing Forum (IDPF) in October 2011. However, to reach true \ninteroperability  in  the  ebook  market,  interoperable  ebook  formats  are \nnot  enough:  the  technical  DRM  measures  used  by  the  retailers  must  also \nbe  interoperable.  DRM  becomes  relevant  if  players  in  the  bookmarket \n(typically  publishers)  want  to  protect  their  content  using  organisational \nor technical measures. With this in mind, we examine whether the DRM \nschemes used in the different ecosystems allow for interoperability. To reach \ntrue interoperability in the ebook market, interoperable ebook formats and \ninteroperable DRM schemes are necessary.","1144":"Our definition of interoperability is that ebooks bought via different chan-\nnels or in different ecosystems can be read using the same reader software \nor  application,  including  using  its  administration  and  social  reading \nfunctionalities.  Interoperability  does  not  occur  if  the  reading  of  different \nbooks requires the use of different reader applications, even if they run on \nthe  same  (hardware)  device.  Likewise,  interoperability  is  not  fulfilled  if \nconversion tools allow authors to cross-publish ebooks in different ecosys-\ntems.  For  example,  Amazon\u2019s  KindleGen  software  converts  EPUB  ebooks \ninto  Amazon\u2019s  KF8  format. The  result  is  two  different  ebooks  that  can  be \ndistributed  in  different  ecosystems.  Moreover,  this  option  only  applies  to \nEPUB ebooks with features that are also supported by KF8. This is a serious \nrestriction, since EPUB 3 provides more features to the author than KF8.","1145":"\fThe document starts with an overview of the development of the open EPUB \nstandard. In Sect.\u00a03, we give details on the EPUB format as well as on other \nrelevant formats developed by Apple (.ibooks and Apple Fixed Layout EPUB) \nand  Amazon  (KF8).  We  chose  Apple  and  Amazon  as  these  are  the  major \nplayers in the ebook market using proprietary book formats. In Sect.\u00a04, we \nstudy  and  compare  the  different  features  of  the  formats,  looking  at  core \nfeatures, multimedia and interactivity, and globalisation and accessibility. \nSect.\u00a06 gives an overview of different DRM mechanisms for ebooks. The final \nSect.\u00a07 presents our conclusions regarding the possibility of an interoperable \nebook format, as well as the options of protecting copyrighted content with \nadequate measures in an interoperable scenario like this.","1146":"The  standardization  of  ebook  formats  goes  back  to  1998,  when  the  Open \nEbook  Authoring  Group  was  founded  during  the  very  first  conference \ndedicated  to  ebooks,  organized  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards \nand  Technology.  The  goal  of  this  working  group  was  to  develop  an  open \nindustry ebook standard based on XML, which would allow the platform-\nindependent use of ebooks. Platform-independence became a relevant issue \nas the reference standard PDF was a good choice for displaying ebooks on \ndesktop  computers.  However,  it  was  inappropriate  for  displaying  ebooks \non mobile handhelds like Palm or Blackberry which became popular at the \nend of the 90s. Such devices have small displays of varying size and much \nlower computing power and memory. Consequently, the new ebook stand-\nard  should  have  been  platform-independent,  reflected  established  content \nformat  standards,  and  served  as  a  reference  for  content  providers  and \ndevice manufacturers. In 1998, the working group started with 25 members \nranging from producers of handhelds and computers to large IT companies \nlike Microsoft, Adobe and Nokia. In 1999, the working group was renamed \nin \u201cOpen eBook Forum\u201d1. The first product of the working group was the \nOpen eBook Publication Structure (OEBPS or OeB) 1.0, which was released \nin 1999. Revisions of the standard were published in June 2001 as version \n1.0.1  and,  with  only  minor  changes,  in  August  2002  as  version  1.2.  This \nversion of the standard already allowed a separation of content and layout \nby the use of cascading style sheets (CSS).","1147":"In 2005, the Open eBook Forum changed its name to \u201cInternational Digital \nPublishing Forum\u201d (IDPF). The motivation for the change was the growing \nand changing ebook market with new players like libraries, publishers, or \nbooksellers and the need for a support of various business models. A major \nproblem of OEBPS 1.2 was the missing support of distribution and interac-\ntion with end-users. The 1.2 standard specified the input format for ebooks, \nbut all output formats which are used for the delivery of the books to the \ncustomer were proprietary. Len Kawell, president of Glassbook, a company \nwhich was purchased by Adobe in 2000, already complained in 1999 that \n\u201cthe OEBPS 1.0 standard only covers the format of the content, not a copy-\nright protection and distribution specification. Thus, Glassbook [like other \ncompanies] was working on an own standard [EBX] covering this area\u201d [15]. \nMost  of  these  proprietary  early  ebook  standards  used  OEBPS  (version  1.0 \nwith  minor  changes)  on  the  production  side,  however,  they  extended  the \nstandard on the distribution side with functionalities like compression or \nproprietary binary codes. Other examples for distribution extensions of the ","1148":"\fOEBPS are the LIT format developed by Microsoft or the MOBI format from \nthe French company Mobipocket SA (Sect.\u00a03.3). However, these proprietary \nextensions  and  developments  were  not  in  line  with  the  goal  of  the  IDPF, \nwhich  wanted  to  define  a  standard  covering  all  areas  ranging  from  the \nproduction and distribution to the end customer. Thus, in 2005, the IDPF \nfounded a working group named OEBPS Container Format Working Group \nto develop a container format that was able to bundle the ebook files in such \na way that was also appropriate for distribution.","1149":"In contrast to OEBPS 1.2, which uses only a subset of XHTML2, OPS 2.0.1 \nuses  XHTML  1.1  for  defining  the  text  and  structure  of  the  content3.  For \nlayout and design, OPS 2.0.1 uses a subset of CSS 2.0 combined with some \nbook-specific  extensions.  Furthermore,  it  supports  vector  graphics  like \nPNG, JPEG, GIF, or SVG. The OPF 2.0.1 part defines the book metadata, the \nfile manifest (list of all files), and the linear reading order (specified in an \nXML file with the .opf extension). In addition, it specifies the hierarchical \ntable of contents in an XML file with the .ncx extension. Finally, OCF 2.0.1 \ndefines how the files and directory structure defined by OPS and OPF are \ncompressed in a single ZIP file with the extension .pub.","1150":"As EPUB 2.0.1 was designed for text-centric books, a variable-width layout is \nthe only option for the display of an ebook. A variable-width layout adapts the \nappearance of the book to the size of the screen, allowing the reader to view an \nebook on a variety of different end-user devices with different screen sizes. EPUB \n2.0.1 did not allow publishers to design ebooks with fixed-width layout, which \nshould look exactly the same on different devices. Fixed layouts are important \nfor graphic-centered books like cookbooks or children\u2019s books. Furthermore, \nEPUB  2.0.1  lacked  any  specifications  for  annotations  and  linking  in  ebooks. \nThus, the usage of ebooks in an educational context was difficult as interaction \nbetween different readers or between readers and publisher was limited.","1151":"\f3  eBook Formats\nAll  current  major  ebook  formats  are  descendants  of  the  earlier  standards \nOEBPS  or  EPUB  2.0.1;  this  is  obviously  true  for  EPUB  3,  but  also  for \nAmazon\u2019s  KF8  format  (Sect.\u00a0 3.3),  which  was  announced  in  2011  with  the \nrelease of the Kindle Fire. The KF8 format is based on the proprietary AZW \nformat, which is a compressed Mobipocket format. The Mobipocket format \nitself is based on OEBPS combined with XHTML, JavaScript, and Frames. \nIt was developed by the French company Mobipocket SA, which was pur-\nchased by Amazon in 2005.","1152":"The  formats  used  by  Apple  also  originate  from  the  earlier  EPUB  standards. \nHowever,  Apple\u2019s  developments  of  its  own  proprietary  formats  (Apple  Fixed \nLayout EPUB and .ibooks; see Sect.\u00a03.2) were mainly motivated by the deficits of \nthe EPUB 2.0.1 standard. Consequently, Apple was actively engaged in the defi-\nnition of the EPUB 3 standard and all relevant features of Apple Fixed Layout \nEPUB and .ibooks can also be found in EPUB 3. For example, the underlying \nbasic concepts for ebook production and distribution as well as large parts of the \nused data structures are similar or identical [11, 17].","1153":"The technologies used in EPUB 2.0.1 (HTML4 and CSS2) allow authors to \npublish text-heavy publications as ebooks. However, the creation of multi-\nmedia or interactive ebooks was very limited. These deficits are addressed \nby EPUB 3, which is based on HTML5 and CSS3 allowing the creation of \nmultimedia  ebooks,  books  with  complex  layout,  mathematical  formulae, \nand interactive  features.  EPUB 3 also introduces functionalities like fixed \nlayout,  non-linear  documents,  or  text-to-speech.  Different  from  EPUB \n2.0.1, the new standard also allows authors to use scripting languages like \nJavaScript, which makes ebooks more interactive and more like programs \nthan static books.","1154":"EPUB  3  heavily  relies  on  HTML5  and  XHTML5,  respectively.  HTML  is \nthe  core technology for all current websites with HTML 2.0 standardized \nalmost 20 years ago in 1995. The new standard HTML5 replaced the older \nHTML 4.01 specification from 1999. XHTML1 (published in 2002) and its \nsuccessor XHTML5 (published along with HTML5), are the XML variants \nof  the  corresponding  HTML  4.01  and  HTML5  specifications.  Different \nfrom  HTML,  which  uses  a  markup  language  for  describing  documents, \nthe XHTML specifications describe web documents using an XML syntax. \nUsing the XML specification, XHTML makes the automated processing of \ndocuments easier. As of December 2012, HTML5 became a W3C Candidate ","1155":"\fRecommendation; the W3C is planning to release a stable HTML5 recom-\nmendation  by  the  end  of  2014.  Although  the  standardization  process  of \nHTML5 is not yet finished, most parts of the specification are stable and all \nrelevant web browsers and many ebook viewers have already implemented \nlarge parts of the standard.","1156":"The stronger capabilities of EPUB 3 in comparison to EPUB 2 mainly come \nfrom the use of HTML5 and CSS3. Highlights of HTML5 are new elements \nlike  audio,  video,  canvas  (drawing  on  the  fly),  the  inline  use  of  scalable \nvector  graphics  and  mathematical  expressions  (MathML),  new  types  of \nform controls, and the removal of many deprecated elements. This leads to \nthe following new features of EPUB 3 [7]: ","1157":"With EPUB 3, the use of audio and video files is possible using the HTML5 \nelements <audio> and <video>. Although different audio and video formats \nare  specified,  not  all  reading  devices  support  all  possible  formats.  Thus, \nEPUB 3 defines core media types which must be supported by all EPUB 3 \ncompatible  reading  devices  and  software  readers.  Standards  for  audio  are \nmp3 and AAC LC in mp4 containers; for video, H.264 and WebM are sug-\ngested formats.","1158":"\fthe HTML5 element <aside>, the text flow can become non-linear which is \nan interesting option for side notes, footnotes, or pop-ups. Although EPUB \n3  allows  the  use  of  scripting,  it  does  not  standardize  (in  relation  to  the \ncore media types for multimedia content) the use of JavaScript elements in \nebooks. The missing recommendation can easily lead to proprietary exten-\nsions  as  well  as  incompatible  EPUB  3  readers  that  support  a  different  or \nincompatible subset of scripting elements.","1159":"HTML5 allows authors to introduce new forms of interaction. For example, \nforms allow publishers to establish a feedback channel for their customers. \nIf the end-user device has a GPS receiver or similar location device (which \nis, for example, the case for many mobile phones), the geographic position \nof  the  reader  can  be  used  for  location-aware  services.  Another  element \n<canvas>  can  be  used  for  drawing  on  the  fly  animations  like  bitmaps  or \nvector graphics as well as movies on a separate pane. Like video and audio, \nthis  powerful  feature  of  EPUB  3  is  not  relevant  for  digital-ink  readers \n(e.g.\u00a0the majority of Kindle readers), as such end-user devices are not able to \nshow animated graphics or movies.","1160":"In EPUB 2.0.1, OPF 2.0.1 specified the hierarchical table of contents in an \nXML  file  with  the  .ncx  extension.  However,  this  standard  was  not  very \nreader-friendly and difficult to use. Thus, EPUB 3 dropped this specification \nand uses instead the HTML5 element <nav> not only for navigation and the \ntable of contents, but also for lists of tables and lists of figures. Lists defined \nusing <nav> are easier to read and interpret by humans.","1161":"For layout and design, the EPUB Content Documents 3.0 specification fully \nsupports CSS 2.1 (same as EPUB 2.0.1) and also some additional elements \nof CSS3. New modules defined by CSS3 and supported by EPUB 3 are the \nSpeech Module5 and Media Queries6. The Speech Module enables authors to \ncontrol the rendering of documents via speech synthesis and provides addi-\ntional text-to-speech enhancement functionalities. For example, it allows a \nreader to control the speech pitch and rate, sound levels, or text-to-speech \nvoices. These stylesheet properties can be used together with visual proper-\nties (mixed media as defined in EPUB Media Overlays 3.0), or as a complete \naural alternative to a visual presentation. CSS Media Queries allow authors \nto define different blocks of CSS code for different screen sizes. Thus, ebook \ncontent can be properly presented on end-user devices with different resolu-\ntions. Examples are the presentation of side notes next to the regular text \non large displays (similar to printed books) versus their integration into the \nregular text using separate boxes on small displays like mobile phones. For \ndigital-ink  displays,  additional  boxes  can  be  drawn  around  the  side  notes \nas such displays cannot display different colours, but only black and white.","1162":"\fnot  adjust  to  the  dimensions  of  the  end-user  device.  This  mechanism  to \nexpress the intended rendering dimensions of an ebook is essential for the \ndesign of graphic-oriented ebooks like children\u2019s books or, in general, books \nin which content and design are so intertwined they cannot be separated. \nThe use of different but connected layers for graphics and underlying text \nstill makes Fixed Layout ebooks full text searchable and allows readers to \nmake use of the text-to-speech functionalities provided by EPUB 3.","1163":"Although  EPUB  3  includes  all  features  that  allow  the  creation  of  enhanced \nebooks with interactive and multimedia content, not all booksellers immedi-\nately used EPUB 3 as the distribution format for their books. An obstacle to the \nuse of the new EPUB 3 standard has been the absence of a fully EPUB\u00a03-com-\npatible ebook reader. Thus, in February 2012 the IDPF together with the Open \nSource project WebKit (which is a widely used open source HTML5 rendering \nengine) and other partners like Adobe, Google, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, O\u2019Reilly, \nSamsung  and  Sony  started  to  develop  Readium7,  an  open  source  reference \nsystem and rendering engine for EPUB 3. The goal of the project is to build a \nreference system for rendering EPUB 3 publications, which can easily be used \nby different ebook readers. Currently, the core EPUB 3 features are supported, \nwhile some others like Media Overlays or text-to-speech are still missing8. Stable \nreleases of Readium are currently available for Google\u2019s Chrome browser. Other \n(proprietary) readers that support parts of the EPUB 3 standard are available \nfrom Apple, whose iBooks reading software (Sect.\u00a03.2) supports large parts of \nthe EPUB 3 standard, or from Ingram\u2019s VitalSource Bookshelf platform9 (who \nhad already claimed in 2012 that its software reader, which is available for all \nmajor platforms, fully supports EPUB 3). We expect that the majority of ebook \nretailers will have their e-reading software fully support EPUB 3 by the end of \n2013. This is, for example, the case with the ebook retailer Kobo, who plan to \nfully support EPUB 3 by the third quarter of 201310.","1164":"In  January  2010,  Apple  announced  the  iPad  together  with  iBooks,  which \nis  an  application  for  viewing  EPUB  (version  2.0.1)  and  PDF  ebooks  on \nApple  devices.  In  April  2010,  iBooks  1.1  became  available  for  the  iPhone \nand iPod Touch running iOS 4. Six months later in December 2010, Apple \nreleased iBooks 1.2 including a new format, the Apple Fixed Layout EPUB \n(Sect.\u00a03.2.1). Like the fixed-layout feature of EPUB 3 (introduced in March \n2012), this feature allows the creation of ebooks where content and layout \ncannot  be  separated.  Typical  examples  are  cookbooks,  travel  books,  pho-\ntography books, or children\u2019s books. The Apple Fixed Layout EPUB format \nis available for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch running Apple\u2019s iOS 4 or later. ","1165":"\fIt is not available on earlier versions of iOS or on other EPUB-compatible \nebook  readers.  In  January  2012,  together  with  the  2.0  version  of  iBooks, \nwhich  allows  ebooks  to  include  interactive  diagrams,  audios  and  videos, \nApple  also  released  the  authoring  tool  iBooks  Author  (Sect.\u00a0 3.2.2),  which \nallows authors to intuitively design enhanced ebooks and self-publish them \nthrough the Apple iBookstore in a format with the extension \u201c.ibooks\u201d. The \nlatest release of iBooks is version 3.0 (announced in October 2012), which \nintroduces new templates, portrait-only books, and some other features.","1166":"Users using the iBooks reading application receive their content primarily \nfrom Apple\u2019s iBookstore. The iBookstore delivers ebooks in the EPUB format \n(including Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB) and .ibooks. As the iBookstore uses \nApple\u2019s FairPlay DRM system (see Sect.\u00a06.2), an export of ebooks out of the \niBooks  application  to  other  readers  is  not  possible.  However,  users  of  the \niBooks reading application can import EPUB and PDF ebooks from various \nother sources as long as they are not DRM protected. The iBookstore deliv-\ners EPUB content only to devices running at least Apple\u2019s iOS 4; a download \nor reading of ebooks in non-Apple environments is not possible. The books \navailable  in  the  iBookstore  come  from  many  major  publishers  (Penguin, \nHarperCollins,  Simon  &  Schuster,  Macmillan,  Hachette,  Springer,  and \nothers)  as  well  as  other  sources  like  Project  Gutenberg11,  which  provides \naccess to thousands of free books, or Smashwords12, which allows independ-\nent authors to self-publish.","1167":"Three of the big ebook retailers (Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Apple) have \ndeveloped their own and proprietary fixed-layout ebook formats. The Barnes \n& Nobles format is essentially an EPUB 2.0.1 format with some extensions. \nThe page images used on the Nook reader of Barnes & Noble (software as \nwell  as  physical  device)  are  directly  created  from  the  incoming  PDF  files. \nApple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB (published in December 2010) is a descendant \nof EPUB 2.0.1 (published in September 2010) extended with some additional \nproprietary features. For example, the allowed page size is predefined and \nthe text does not reflow with changing screen sizes and resolutions.","1168":"Publishers  of  children\u2019s  books  were  especially  interested  in  Apple\u2019s  Fixed \nLayout EPUB as it offers features not available with the EPUB 2.0.1 standard. \nApple designed its Fixed Layout format so that the presentation of ebooks is \noptimal for the Apple devices iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Apple is able to \nensure a proper presentation of graphic elements and illustrations in ebooks \nas they have full control over their reading devices running iBooks and do not \nneed to support any non-iOS devices. There are only a few limitations of the \nformat for publishers, for example, a maximal resolution for cover images, a \nmaximal file size, a fixed size for videos, and constraints on the CSS parameters.","1169":"\fBesides  the  fixed-layout  option,  the  Apple  Fixed  Layout  EPUB  format \nalso  has  some  other  interesting  features  like  text-to-speech  and  scripting. \nThe  text-to-speech  functionality  (Apple  denoted  this  functionality  \u201cRead \nAloud\u201d) is very similar to EPUB 3 (released ten months after Apple\u2019s Fixed \nLayout EPUB) and realized by using Media Overlays (Sect.\u00a03.1). Furthermore, \nin analogy to the upcoming EPUB 3 standard, Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB \nallows the use of JavaScript. However, Adobe Flash animations are not pos-\nsible  as  Apple  does  not  support  this  software.  In  summary,  Apple\u2019s  Fixed \nLayout EPUB offered publishers additional features ten months before the \nrelease of EPUB 3. With the release of EPUB 3, Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB \nbecame obsolete as all of its features are covered by EPUB 3. Currently, it is \nnot actively developed by Apple any more, Apple instead supports and uses \nEPUB as the main format for ebooks. Nevertheless, there are still publishers \nwho mainly publish ebooks through the iBookstore and prefer Apple\u2019s Fixed \nLayout EPUB over EPUB 3.","1170":"In January 2012, Apple presented the ebook authoring application iBooks \nAuthor13, a tool aimed at authors and publishers interested in self-publishing. \nIn October 2012, Apple launched a new version 2.0 with additional features \nlike  font  embedding,  rendering  of  mathematical  equations,  and  higher \ninteractivity. The application can only be used on computers with iOS 5 or \nlater and is free of charge. The output of iBooks Author is a book in either \nPDF format or a proprietary Apple file format (extension .ibooks) which can \nonly be published through Apple\u2019s iBookstore. The .ibooks format is based \non EPUB 3, but uses proprietary XML namespaces and CSS extensions [6, \n5]. A publication of ebooks produced by iBooks Author in online stores or \nplatforms  different  from  Apple\u2019s  iBookstore  is  not  possible.  eBooks  in  the \n.ibooks format can only be viewed on iOS devices using the iBooks reading \napplication. A direct import of EPUB ebooks into iBooks Author is neither \npossible nor necessary [18, 8], as authors that are interested in publishing \nEPUB books can directly upload their EPUB ebooks in the Apple iBookstore.","1171":"Technically, iBooks Author is an easy-to-use WYSIWYG editor for ebooks. \nAuthors can directly edit text, colours, images, and charts. To create inter-\nactive  elements,  Apple  introduced  customizable  widgets  allowing  authors \nto create features like image galleries, movies or audio files, multiple-choice \nquestions, slideshows, 3D elements, separate scrolling sidebars, pop-overs, \nand general HTML5 widgets14.","1172":"In summary, Apple supports the open EPUB standard and with the iBooks \nreading  application  provides  one  of  the  best  EPUB  3-compatible  readers. \nApple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB was a temporarily used proprietary format which \nallowed authors to prepare fixed-layout ebooks before this feature was avail-\nable in EPUB 3 more than 15 months later. In general, eBooks in the EPUB ","1173":"\fformat  can  be  easily  imported  into  Apple\u2019s  ecosystem  and  displayed  on \nApple devices. However, Apple established a closed ecosystem, as all ebooks \nonce  developed  or  distributed  inside  the  Apple  world  can  never  leave  the \necosystem (except as PDF) and cannot be displayed or read on non-Apple \ndevices.  The  main  instrument  of  Apple  for  creating  a  closed  ecosystem  is \nits DRM system FairPlay (see Sect.\u00a06.2), which controls the usage of content \non Apple devices and which does not allow an export of content out of the \nApple world. Although Apple encourages authors to use the EPUB standard \nand  uses  the  standard  within  its  own  ecosystem,  the  system  is  closed  as \nebooks can only be imported in the ecosystem, but are not allowed to leave \nthe Apple world.","1174":"In  addition,  Apple  established  an  incompatible  format  for  the  generation \nof  content  that  should  be  distributed  in  its  ecosystem. The  authoring  tool \niBooks Author produces ebooks in the .ibooks format, which is incompat-\nible with EPUB and can only be used and read inside the Apple ecosystem. \nThe incompatibility between .ibooks (which can only be published through \nthe iBookstore) and EPUB 3 is artificial and intended as it ensures that the \nauthoring  tool  iBooks  Author  can  only  be  used  for  ebooks  that  are  sold \nthrough  Apple\u2019s  iBookstore.  By  using  a  non-standard  variant  of  EPUB  3, \nApple prevents authors using iBooks Author to create ebooks that are pub-\nlished on other platforms rather than the iBookstore.","1175":"In January 2012, Amazon released its new proprietary ebook format KF8. \nThis XML format replaced the proprietary MOBI format, which was devel-\noped by the French company Mobipocket SA. Mobipocket SA was acquired \nby  Amazon  in  2005.  The  MOBI  format  (file  extension  .mobi  or  .prc)  is \nbased  on  the  OEBPS  format  (Sect.\u00a0 2)  extended  by  JavaScript  and  Frames. \nFor copyright-protected ebooks, Amazon uses the AZW format, which is a \nvariant of the MOBI format with additional compression. The AZW format \nallows Amazon to apply a DRM scheme (see Sect.\u00a06.2) and to restrict the use \nof an ebook to a particular device (identified by its device ID associated to \nan Amazon user account). DRM-free AZW files are just compressed MOBI \nfiles. The MOBI (as well as AZW) format allow authors to produce text-heavy \nbooks; the support of multimedia or interactivity features is not possible.","1176":"eBooks  sold  through  Amazon\u2019s  Kindle  Store  can  be  read  either  using  the \nproprietary Kindle reading devices, the proprietary Kindle reading software \nwhich is available for various operating systems (including iOS), or directly \nin a web browser. The first Kindle reader was introduced in 2007; a newer \nDX line with a larger screen was introduced in 2009. Newer reading devices \nhave  additional  features  like  keyboard  (Kindle  Keyboard),  touch  display \n(Kindle Paperwhite), or colour display (Kindle Fire). All Kindles (except the \nKindle Fire, which was introduced in September 2011) use digital ink, which \nlimits the available colours to black and white.","1177":"\fAmazon\u2019s  reading  devices  and  software  can  only  display  ebooks  available \nin PDF, AZW (MOBI), or KF8. Other formats like EPUB or Apple\u2019s Fixed \nLayout EPUB cannot be displayed. In addition, Kindle\u2019s terms of use explic-\nitly forbid transferring ebooks sold through Amazon to other non-Amazon \ndevices.  Due  to  the  large  economic  success  of  Amazon,  ebooks  in  AZW \nformat are also available in other commercial and non-commercial ebook \nstores like Fictionwise (an electronic bookseller owned by Barnes & Noble), \nProject Gutenberg15, the World Public Library, and others.","1178":"Amazon started a self-publishing service named Kindle Direct Publishing \nin 2007. In the standard program, Amazon keeps about 65% of the revenues \nfrom ebook sales; the remaining revenue is for the author (and publisher). A \nnewer program (named Kindle Direct Publishing Select Program) increases \nthe royalties for the authors to 70% (which is similar to ebooks sold through \nApple\u2019s  iBookstore),  however  an  author  must  remove  his\/her  ebook  from \nsales on all other websites, including their own website, for the first 90 days \nafter publication. During this time period, Amazon has the exclusive right \nto distribute and sell the ebook.","1179":"Technically,  the  KF8  format  supports  HTML5  and  CSS3.  For  downward \ncompatibility, a KF8 file contains two formats: a MOBI file of the ebook and \na data structure similar to EPUB. Detailed specifications of the KF8 format \nare not publicly available. KF8 files can be created using either KindleGen16 \nor  a  Plugin  for  Adobe  InDesign17.  The  proprietary  command  line  tool \nKindleGen  is  a  converter  which  expects  documents  in  HTML,  XTML, \nor  EPUB  format  as  input  and  converts  them  into  KF818.  Analogously,  the \nPlugin for Adobe InDesign allows a direct conversion of InDesign files to \nKF8. There are no other publicly available tools that allow authors to gener-\nate KF8 files.","1180":"In  comparison  to  the  previous  MOBI  format,  the  new  KF8  format  allows \nauthors  to  include  audio  and  video  elements  in  an  ebook  by  supporting \nthe HTML5 elements <audio> and <video>. However, not all of Amazon\u2019s \nreaders and reading applications support video. For example, movies can be \nplayed by the Kindle reading software for iOS but not by the Kindle reading \nsoftware for Android or the different Kindle devices, including the Kindle \nFire. All Kindle readers (except Kindle Fire) can only play audio files (if they \nhave an earphone plug). Any kind of text-to-speech or read aloud function-\nality is not supported by KF8.","1181":"\fare offered as an alternative to the KF8 syntax. However, KF8 still carries \nforward some HTML constructions that were de-standardized years ago, but \nit also extends the EPUB 3 format with some functions to support Amazon\u2019s \nproprietary fixed-layout option. To help authors to publish books through \nits  Kindle  Store,  Amazon  publishes  a  list  of  all  HTML  and  CSS  elements \nthat are compatible with its KF8 format [1]. Like EPUB 3, KF8 supports CSS \nMedia Queries, scalable vector graphics, and a fixed-layout option. As KF8 \nsupports  no  JavaScript,  HTML5  elements  like  <canvas>  cannot  be  used. \nAlso, MathML is not supported.","1182":"In  summary,  Amazon  does  not  support  the  EPUB  standard,  but  uses  its \nown  proprietary  KF8  standard.  KF8  files  are  generated  by  a  proprietary \nconverter which accepts EPUB files as input. However, Amazon introduced \nproprietary extensions and modifications making the two standards EPUB \nand KF8 incompatible. Like Apple, the Amazon world accepts EPUB files \nas input but does not allow users to export or transfer ebooks to other eco-\nsystems.  The  Kindle  readers,  as  well  as  the  Kindle  reading  software,  only \ndisplay  ebooks  bought  in  the  Amazon  ebook  store,  and  Amazon\u2019s  Kindle \nStore delivers content only to Amazon reading devices and software. This \nmakes Amazon\u2019s ecosystem closed as it allows no free exchange of books. \nAnalogously to the Apple world, the main instruments for a closed ecosys-\ntem are the impossibility of exporting ebooks, the tight coupling between \nreading devices and store, and the DRM protection. Unlike Apple, Amazon \nalso uses an incompatible ebook format, which strengthens the closeness of \nits ecosystem.","1183":"\f4  Feature Comparison\nIn the previous sections, the focus was on the description of the develop-\nment of ebook formats up to EPUB 2.0.1, which for the first time integrated \nthe standardization of ebook files for production with a standardization of \nebooks  for  distribution  to  the  end-user.  In  the  latter  case,  issues  such  as \ncompression  had  to  be  addressed.  Moreover,  the  approaches  to  overcome \nidentified shortcomings of EPUB 2\/2.0.1 (2007\/2010) have been introduced. \nThese  are  primarily  in  the  areas  of  interactivity  and  multimedia  (in  the \ndirection of so-called enhanced ebooks), but also including, for example, the \noption to \u2018switch off\u2019 the reflow of text depending on the screen size or the \nresolution. The central strand of these efforts to overcome the restrictions of \nEPUB\u00a02 is the further development of the standard in the form of EPUB\u00a03 \n(2011\/2012);  however,  as  we  have  seen,  there  are  also  three  proprietary \nattempts, namely KF8 (by Amazon), Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks (both \nby Apple). In the following section we will single out potentially important \nfeatures publishers might like to see in their ebooks. We will then inspect \nthe ebook formats in relation to their ability to realize these ebook features \nwith the help of features of their respective formats. The selection as well as \nthe structuring of the ebook features covered in the following is influenced \nby an application-oriented perspective, rather than one on the basis of the \ndevelopment  history  or  the  technological  concept  of  the  formats.  Format \nfeatures are clearly in focus; if it seems necessary or sensible, however, we \nwill take reading device and reader software issues into account.","1184":"Metadata are data about data, in this case data about ebooks. Some of them \nare conveyed content-internally, i.e. as part of the ebook file (e.g. the author \nor the publisher of a book), or content-externally (e.g. the price or the order \nnumber).  They  are  often  used  for  administrative  purposes  (e.g.  to  enable \nthe  identification  of  knowledge  resources  by  users  or  to  specify  copyright \nrestrictions). In the case of EPUB 3 and EPUB 2, the Dublin Core Metadata \nElement  Set  (DCMES,  in  short:  Dublin  Core19)  is  supported  for  different \nkinds of metadata (the publication as a whole, but also, e.g., the videos in it). \nDublin Core is a metadata standard that is also used in other contexts, espe-\ncially library management; it specifies the information dimensions covered \nrelated to a content object. Certain metadata information of the 15 dimen-\nsions from Dublin Core, such as title, language, identifier (e.g. the ISBN) are \ndefined as compulsory in EPUB, while others (e.g. author(s), publisher) are \noptional.  In  addition  to  this,  EPUB  3  allows  the  definition  of  customized \nmetadata information dimensions. Apart from Dublin Core, the metadata \nstandards MARC (Library of Congress) and ONIX for Books (book trade), ","1185":"With  KF8,  the  situation  is  \u2013  due  to  the  common  line  of  descent  of  the \nformats  (and  the  OPF  file  in  particular)  \u2013  similar.  The  difference  is,  that \nKF8 does not support the definition of additional customized information \ndimensions  and  has  only  a  subset  of  12  out  of  the  15  basic  Dublin  Core \ninformation dimensions; of those, only the title and the language informa-\ntion  are  compulsory.  On  the  other  hand,  older  versions  of  KF8  store  the \nreference  to  the  cover  as  an  obligatory  metadata  item,  which  is  different \nfrom the solution in other formats (see below).","1186":"Generally, the presentation of text (regarding, for example, font and font \nsize)  is  controlled  by  the  default  settings  of  the  reader  software  or  the \ndevice,  but  also,  alternatively,  by  the  parameters  defined  by  the  actual \nuser in a certain situation. EPUB 3 and KF8, however, allow the definition \nof  default  font,  font  size,  character,  word  and  line  distances,  etc.,  using \nCSS. These settings can be overwritten by explicit customer intervention \nif desired and provided for by the reader application. The font file (in one \nof the two font formats OTF and WOFF, a W3C font format recommenda-\ntion) can be made a part of the ebook file and be referenced from the OPF \nfile. The handling of type-related values set for particular titles, however, \nis  not  managed  in  a  satisfactory  manner  by  many  reader  applications\/\ndevices, up to the present day.","1187":"To prevent users from getting easy access to fonts supplied with ebook titles, \nEPUB  3  allows  publishers  to  obfuscate  fonts  by  encrypting  parts  of  the \nfont file. The algorithm encrypts the first 1040 bytes of the font file using a \nkey that depends on the actual content. This mechanism allows the use of \nfonts only for specific content and prevents a further distribution of fonts. \nThe mechanisms make the distribution of fonts more difficult, but they are \ncomparatively easy to circumvent. This somewhat compromised protection \nis the reason, why many commercially traded fonts are not approved for the \nuse in EPUB ebooks by the font copyright holders. With KF8, the encryp-\ntion  of  the  embedded  fonts  (in  this  case  in  OTF  or  TTF  as  font  formats) \nis guaranteed by the binary encoding of the ebook file as a whole. For the \nsupport of international character sets, please consult Sect.\u00a04.3.","1188":"Issues  regarding  font,  font  size,  etc.,  have  been  dealt  with  in  the  previous \nsubsection;  this  subsection  covers  issues  concerning  the  distribution  of \ntext on a page. The type area (the area of the page without the top, bottom, \nright  and  left  margins)  can  be  defined  globally  in  EPUB  3  using  the  CSS \ncommand \u201cmargin\u201d. With KF8, it cannot be controlled globally and the top \nand bottom margins cannot be customized at all; the default print area on \nAmazon  devices\/reader  applications,  however,  provides  for  rather  big  top \nand bottom margins by default.","1189":"With a reflowable text \u2013 a text that adapts to a particular screen concerning \nline length and line breaks \u2013 enforced page breaks generally do not make \nsense. With the help of the CSS command \u201cpage-break\u201d, it can be achieved, \ne.g., to mark the beginning of a chapter. Moreover, reader applications gen-\nerally insert a page break between the different HTML files that make up \nan  ebook.  Compared  to  KF8,  EPUB  3  offers  additional  options  to  control \nthe aesthetics of the displaying of text, e.g. by commands like \u201cpage-break-\nbefore\u201d or \u201cavoid\u201d (keep paragraphs or headings together with subheadings). \nMoreover, there are commands that prevent \u201corphans\u201d and \u201cwidows\u201d; since \nthe corresponding violation of typographic rules is considered unaesthetic, \nthese commands enforce minimum numbers of lines as last and first para-\ngraphs on pages, respectively. EPUB 3 also offers an automatic hyphenation \nwhich  can  be  avoided  by  using  the  command  \u201cnon-breaking-space\u201d.  The \ndefects  of  KF8  mentioned  are  the  reason  why  the  composition  in  Kindle \nenvironments  is  often  criticized  by  typographers.  Other  reasons  for  this \nare, that KF8 (as opposed to EPUB 3) does not enable language-dependent \nautomatic syllable divisions and has justified composition as a default. KF8, \nhowever,  allows  at  least  \u201csoft-hyphens\u201d,  the  upfront  tagging  of  potential \nbreaks by the publisher.","1190":"The  challenge  of  fixed-layout  arrangements  with  digital  books  is  that  the \nlook of the page (with text in a predefined typeface, in a predefined type size, \netc.) on the one hand has to be stored, transferred and displayed much like \nan image. On the other hand, however, the text of the page should still be \nsearchable (which, of course, is not the case for text as images). To achieve \nthis, texts of the page has to be defined not only regarding the ASCII values \nof letters and numbers, but also regarding fixed pixel information. This is a \nchallenge that in principle is, for example, analogically addressed by PDF as \na data format.","1191":"The result for readers is similar with all fixed-layout formats \u2013 if he or she \nwants  to  enlarge  certain  sections  on  a  page,  this  can  only  be  achieved  by \nzooming in and not by, for example, selecting a larger font and have the page \nline-wrapped accordingly. In the case of KF8, the zooming in is provided ","1192":"\fwith the help of pop-ups; the sections to be displayed in the pop-ups have to \nbe identified by the publisher in advance. If provided for by reader applica-\ntions on special devices, a fixed-layout double page spread is displayed rather \nthan a single page. This can be triggered by certain conditions (Fixed Layout \nEPUB on iPads, controlled by an inclination sensor) or set globally (KF8, \ncontrolled by the publisher in advance, using the \u201clandscape\u201d command).","1193":"In fixed-layout contexts, it has to be defined explicitly, in which place on a \npage a letter, a word or an image are meant to be displayed. This description \nof the visual appearance of the page and its components can be realized with \nfixed pixel measurements in EPUB 3, whereas in KF8 percent measurements \nand  the  \u201cem\u201d  measure,  a  traditional  measure  used  by  typographers  (an \nalternative to points\/pt), are used. An informal example for the former solu-\ntion would be that an \u201cA\u201d in 10 pt Times New Roman is positioned at pixel \nlocation X=200\/y=400: for the latter solution, that this letter is positioned at \n30% of the horizontal and 40% of the vertical extension of the actual screen.\nIt is obvious that the latter solution can cope with yet unknown screen sizes \nand resolutions in the future.","1194":"Differences  between  the  various  fixed-layout  solutions  are,  for  example, \ngiven by the fact that the fixed-layout option has to\/can only be set globally \nin KF8, i.e. for the whole document. This is done as part of the global choice \nbetween the main genres the format is designed for, namely children\u2019s books \non the one hand and comics on the other. This is specified in the metadata. \nAs opposed to this restriction, the fixed-layout option can be specified for \nsingle  pages  in  EPUB  3,  in  the  HTML  header.  Another  difference  is  that, \nin KF8, the visually oriented page description is specified for double-page \nspreads, whereas this is done for single pages in the other formats.","1195":"With  Apple\u2019s  Fixed  Layout  EPUB,  the  fixed-layout  option  is  triggered \nthrough a corresponding file that is added to the META-INF folder. With \nKF8 and EPUB 3, it is done in the OPF folder, where all metadata are speci-\nfied. Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB can be seen as the functional predecessor \nof EPUB 3 with respect to this feature.","1196":"Displaying tables in ebooks requires a trading off between appearance and \nreadability of the table for readers on the one hand, and searchability and \nadaptability to displaying parameters like screen size and resolution on the \nother. A way that exclusively stresses the first in reflowable contexts is includ-\ning tables as images. Including tables using HTML and CSS to be rendered ","1197":"\faccording to displaying parameters is a solution that provides searchability \n\u2013 it also allows the application of the text-to-speech function on them. In \nspite of being provided for in all formats in principle, this does not yield sat-\nisfying results in more complex cases (extensive use of colours, lines, wide \ncolumns, etc.). The reason for this is the current  state of the development \nof the reader applications, which are not yet able to cope with some of the \nstandard table constructs of HTML and CSS; evidence for such unsatisfying \ncases  in  different  ecosystems  is  documented  [10,  Sect.\u00a0 4.6].  As  a  fall-back \nsolution,  an  HTML  file  can  additionally  be  linked  to  an  image. There  are \nsolutions for better results: these, however, require additional effort, either \nby using Media Queries and specifying explicitly different tables for differ-\nent displaying parameters or, indeed, by using JavaScript. Both options, of \ncourse, depend on the support of Media Queries or JavaScript by the respec-\ntive formats.","1198":"EPUB 2 did not provide an explicit solution to include a cover in the sense \nof a cover image. It was possible, however, to reference a corresponding file \nfrom the metadata. This solution can still be used to cater for downward-\ncompatibility  in  EPUB  3  and  KF8  and  is  still  the  standard  way  it  is  done \nwith Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks. The more elaborate EPUB 3 \nsolution  is  to  reference  the  cover  image  from  the  spine  and  include  it  in \nthe manifest of the OPF file \u2013 as JPEG, PNG, GIF or SVG and without size \nrestrictions.  The  reference  in  the  spine  specifies  the  position  of  the  cover \nimage relative to, for example, the table of contents or the cover page while \nreading  the  ebook.  Interestingly,  this  solution  is  also  provided  for  in  the \ncurrent version of KF8.","1199":"Independently from how reader applications present this feature to readers \n(i.e. by showing buttons for every chapter), the traditional format for tables \nof contents in EPUB 2 was an obligatory .ncx file. It is still the standard way \nit is done with Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks. This solution was \nreplaced  by  a  non-proprietary  HTML5  solution  using  the  <nav>  element \nin  EPUB  3.  The  units  marked  up  with  the  help  of  the  <nav>  element  do \nnot have to be text, they can also be images. By using \u201cpage-list\u201d together \nwith the <nav> element referring to a traditional fixed page number is also ","1200":"\fpossible,  as  long  as  these  page  numbers  are  also  specified  in  the  text  files \nthemselves.  Interestingly,  this  solution  is  also  provided  for  in  the  current \nversion of KF8. Before this last amendment, KF8 also used the .ncx file; in \naddition, the inclusion of an HTML table of contents page that is presented \nto the reader as the first page of the text is recommended \u2013 on top of the UI \nsolution of the reader application on the basis of the .ncx file (as mentioned, \ne.g. with the help of buttons). Amazon\u2019s idea behind this is to satisfy possible \nexpectations by readers.","1201":"Regarding the integration of images, the general solution has not changed \nfrom EPUB 2 to the formats in focus in this report: images are integrated \nusing  the  HTML  element  <img>.  When  using  the  fixed-layout  option \n(for  children\u2019s  books  and  comics)  in  KF8,  however,  the  CSS  command \n\u201cbackground-image\u201d  must  be  used  instead  of  the  <img>  element.  This  is \nto prevent a collision with the KF8-specific region magnification function.","1202":"KF8  supports  GIF,  BMP,  JPEG,  non-transparent  PNG  and  SVG  as  image \nformats. There are recommendations (resolution: rather low) and restrictions \n(file size, different for ebooks using the fixed-layout option and ones that do \nnot). The adherence to these restrictions is taken care of automatically by the \nKindleGen production software; it is said to be not in the interest of users \n(download times).","1203":"The  EPUB  3  specifications  Content  Documents  3.021  and  Media  Overlays \n3.022 specify in which way audio and video files are integrated, played back \nand  synchronized  in  an  ebook.  This  is  primarily  done  using  the  HTML5 \nelements  <audio>  and  <video>.  The  audio  and  video  formats  any  reader\/\ndevice will be expected to be able to play back are listed as core media types \nin the Publications 3.0 specification23, while others are optional.","1204":"The integration of audio and video is the central improvement, which Apple \nintroduced with its Fixed Layout EPUB format in 2010 (EPUB only first fea-\ntured this in its EPUB 3 version from 2011, see above) [4]. At this time, such \nan  integration  was  not  possible  with  any  other  ebook  format.  To  achieve \nthis, Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB supported the HTML5 elements <audio> \nand <video> from the beginning. To guarantee an optimal playback of the \nmultimedia content on mobile Apple devices, Apple specifies maximal file \nsizes, a selection of supported data formats as well as (for video) the size of \nthe corresponding frame; according to that, audio can be integrated as m4a \nfiles (AAC, MP4), and video as m4v files (H.264 in an MPEG4 container) [4].","1205":"The  format  produced  by  Apple\u2019s  iBooks  Author  ebook  authoring  tool  can \n\u2013 in spite of the format specification not being published \u2013 be said to be a \nvariant of EPUB (2). The format details of the integration of audio and video \nfiles (which is possible) are not known \u2013 from the features presented on the \nauthoring tool interface, it can be deduced, however, what .ibooks files must \nbe able to express and what the iBooks reader software on Apple devices can \nplay back: iBooks Author from version 2.0 on supports the integration of all \nmultimedia data formats that are supported by Apple\u2019s QuickTime media \nplayer24.  The  iBooks  Author  authoring  tool  optimizes  audio  and  video \nregarding resolution etc., for the rendering on iPads.","1206":"Also with KF8, the integration of video and audio files in ebooks is generally \npossible \u2013 like in the other cases, the HTML5 elements <audio> and <video> \nare used for that. The playing back of audio and video content, however, is \nonly enabled for the case of ebooks being read with the help of Amazon\u2019s \nKindle  iOS  app  for  the  mobile  devices  of  Apple  [2]  \u2013  but  not  on  Amazon \ndevices.  This  is  surprising,  since  at  least  some  of  Amazon\u2019s  own  reading \ndevices are, in principle, able to play multimedia content (some only audio, \nthe Kindle Fire also video).","1207":"\u201cEPUB 3 provides the following text-to-speech (TTS) facilities for control-\nling aspects of speech synthesis, such as pronunciation, prosody and voice \ncharacteristics:  Pronunciation  Lexicons  using  the  W3C  Pronunciation \nLexicon  Specification  1.0  (PLS)27;  the  incorporation  of  SSML  phonemes \nfunctionality  directly  into  a  EPUB  Content  Document,  using  the  Speech \nSynthesis  Markup  Language  (SSML)  Version  1.0  28;  CSS  Speech  Features \nfrom the CSS3 specification CSS Speech Module29.\u201d30 This means, that, using \nEPUB  3,  features  of  the  text-to-speech  output  by  a  corresponding  engine \nof a reader software can be parametrized (with respect to volume, male or \nfemale voice, modulation, etc.) by a set of standardized declarative files, one \nof them being CSS Speech, a part of CSS3. This feature enables, for example, \n\u201csynthetic\u201d audio books on the basis of written text in a very flexible manner.","1208":"The Media Overlays function enables the synchronization of audio (typically \npre-recorded audio narration) with textual content, typically by highlight-\ning  (e.g.  with  the  help  of  colour)  the  word  just  pronounced  at  any  given \nmoment. \u201cIn EPUB 3, Media Overlay Documents are created to describe the \ntiming for the pre-recorded audio narration and how it relates to the EPUB \nContent Document markup. The file format for Media Overlays is defined \nas a subset of SMIL, a W3C recommendation for representing synchronized \nmultimedia  information  in  XML.\u201d31  The  narration  \u201ccan  be  represented  as \na  series  of  audio  clips,  each  corresponding  to  part  of  the  EPUB  Content \nDocument.  A  single  audio  clip,  for  example,  typically  represents  a  single \nphrase  or  paragraph,  but  infers  no  order  relative  to  the  other  clips  or  to \nthe text of a document. Media Overlays solve this problem of synchroniza-\ntion  by  tying  the  structured  audio  narration  to  its  corresponding  text  (or \nother media) in the EPUB Content Document using SMIL markup. Media \nOverlays are, in fact, a simplified subset of SMIL 3.0 that allow the playback \nsequence  of  these  clips  to  be  defined.\u201d32  For  making  the  synchronization \nwork, both the textual content and the (single) audio file, therefore, have to \nbe tagged accordingly, using the mark-up provided by SMIL (a specialized \nXML language). Synchronizing textual information with other time-based \nmedia, e.g. with video subtitling, would generally follow the same principle, \nbut is not yet supported by EPUB 3.","1209":"Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB also offers the function to synchronize written \ntext with audio, highlighting words in the text correspondingly. This func-\ntion is called Read Aloud with Apple and is restricted to Fixed Layout EPUBs; \nreflowable EPUBs cannot make use of this feature, even if they are conform-\nable with the iBookstore. \u201cIn read aloud books, an audio file using a narra-\ntor\u2019s voice can read the text on a page and the words can be highlighted as \nthey are spoken. The reader can choose to have the pages turn automatically \nto keep the session flowing, or set them to turn manually. iBooks (Reader \napp) syncs text and audio using Media Overlays, an EPUB-specific subset of \nSynchronized  Multimedia  Integration  Language  (SMIL).\u201d  [4]  This  means, \nthat Apple \u2013 as with the IDPF standard\/EPUB 3 \u2013 uses SMIL to configure \nthe  synchronisation  of  pre-recorded  audio  with  text.  Fixed  Layout  EPUB \nalso allows the integration of play, pause and stop controls into the reader \n(on Apple devices). When using those, the listener can control the playing \nback of the audio. A text-to-speech option, triggering and configuring the \nreading by a \u201csynthetic\u201d voice is not provided in Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB.","1210":"With EPUB 3, there are two possibilities to realize native animations (as opposed \nto pre-recorded ones that are played back as videos) and interactive features. \nOne has to keep in mind in any case, that animated content only makes sense \non backlit devices like smartphones and tablets, since digital ink readers are not \nable to play this back due to hardware restrictions. The first possibility is using \nthe CSS construct of transformations; using this, objects can be translated, etc. \nThis is part of the core EPUB 3 specification and therefore any reader software\/\ndevice conforming to EPUB 3 must be able to display corresponding content. \nSimple animations and other dynamic content items can be realized this way: \nobjects get positioned 2- or 3-dimensionally and are made to move33. The other \nfunctionally less restricted possibility is using JavaScript code; this, however, is \nonly an optional element of EPUB 3 and therefore certain reader applications\/\ndevices might not be able to display it. The IDPF therefore recommends to use ","1211":"\falternative  options  rather  than  JavaScript  whenever  possible.  More  advanced \nmodes of animations interactivity can only be realized using JavaScript, however. \nSo, JavaScript together with the HTML5 element <aside> enables better options, \ne.g.  for  marginalia  or  footnotes,  such  as  pop-ups.  Further  JavaScript  options \ninclude forms which can be used to establish a feedback channel from the reader \nto the publisher, or functions that make use of the geographical location of the \nreader, which is made available in the case of devices with a GPS sensor via an \nHTML5 element. Coming back to animations \u2013 in the sense of dynamic graph-\nics \u2013 JavaScript code can be used for specifying objects and their movements on \nan HTML5 construct called canvas. This allows the replacement of proprietary \ntechnologies like Adobe Flash34, which is, for example, not available on Apple \ndevices. Since JavaScript is always executed in a so-called \u201csandbox\u201d, however, \nthere cannot be a sustainable exchange between the JavaScript application and \nother applications on the device. This makes it impossible to make use of contact \ndetails  from  the  email  application  or  to  permanently  store  settings  beyond  a \nsession in the EPUB container.","1212":"The authoring tool iBooks Author promises users that the integration of dynamic \ncontent is particularly easy \u2013 using the slogan \u201cInteractivity in every book\u201d to \ncommunicate this35. Correspondingly, there are widgets for the production of \npop-ups,  interactive  images  with  wheeling  and  zooming  options,  animated \npresentations, scrollable sidebars, multiple choice tests, etc. As mentioned above, \nthe .ibooks format is not publicly documented and it is, therefore, not possible \nto formally describe the expressive power (and its limits) of .ibooks with respect \nto animations and interactivity in more detail. It is even possible with iBooks \nAuthor to integrate so-called HTML widgets (consisting of JavaScript and CSS \ncode),  which  is  essentially  custom-made  interactive  content  that  can  thus  be \nintegrated into .ibooks ebooks, supplementing functions that cannot be realized \nusing the built-in options of the tool.","1213":"EPUB 3 has been designed by the IDPF to be used worldwide, hence also \nacross languages and writing systems. This can be illustrated by the fact that \nnon-Latin writing systems\/character sets (and their possibly differing direc-\ntions of reading: from top to bottom, from right to left,\u2026) can be integrated, \ne.g. for Japanese, Chinese or Arabic. As a generalization of a core feature, \nfonts of the writing systems mentioned, including special characters, can be \nincluded. Most of the features just mentioned are also available for EPUB 3 \nmetadata, including file and directory names: this makes global distribution \neasier. The UTF-8 encoding for the Unicode character set is supported36. In \nHTML5,  referring  to  the  ebook  content,  reading  directions  can  be  speci-\nfied for the rendering engines of reader applications\/devices. HTML5 \u2013 and \nhence EPUB 3 \u2013 also supports ruby annotations, a system for annotations \nfor the pronunciation of Asian languages (but presupposes that the reader \nsoftware\/device is able to display it). Beyond this, CSS3 modules allow for \ndesign options regarding the typography, e.g. by vertically displaying text in \na writing system that is usually displayed horizontally. It also allows for the \ncontrol of syllable divisions and the representation of stress marks on top \nof letters. Finally, as mentioned already while presenting the text-to-speech \nfunctionality, pronunciation rules for any language can be specified using \nPLS and SSML; this includes interpreting ruby annotations (see above).","1214":"With  KF8,  only  Latin,  Japanese  (without  ruby  annotations,  however), \nChinese,  and  Korean  characters  are  supported  to  a  certain  extent.  As  an \noption (the support is not guaranteed for all Kindle devices [2]), left-to-right \nwriting  systems  can  also  be  displayed  vertically,  if  this  is  specified  in  the \nmetadata accordingly. This does not apply for writing systems with a right-\nto-left reading direction, however.","1215":"\falternative media element in place of one that might not be received by the \nebook  user,  be  it  as  a  consequence  of  a  disability  or  in  a  certain  situation \n(e.g. with background noise).

In EPUB 3, there are HTML5 options to realize this, e.g. using an \nattribute within the <video> element.","1216":"\u201cThe Advanced\/Hybrid Layouts working group intends to publish a set of \nmodular  specifications  that  extends  EPUB  3  functionality  to  better  meet \nthe full needs of the ecosystem with regards to user and context adaptation \nand reading of image-based publications such as comics and magazines.\u201d37 \nIn future versions of EPUB, these specifications will, for example, allow to \ndifferentiate presentation specifications between different parts of publica-\ntions, e.g., for the case of multilingual publications.","1217":"In38  some  reader  applications,  dictionaries  for  use  from  other  ebooks  can \nbe integrated. These can be consulted from all ebooks on the correspond-\ning  reader,  not  differentiating  between  them. The  IDPF,  however,  sees  the \nneed for access to specific dictionaries, glossaries, etc. from certain books \n(e.g. children\u2019s books, language learning books, scholarly books). Therefore, \nfuture versions of EPUB will be able to integrate dictionaries and glossaries \nspecific to books; one among these can be selected as a preferred source of \nreference for a book by users.","1218":"\u201cIndexes are specialized navigational and supplemental information tools that \noffer readers an interaction with content that is enhanced, more powerful, and \nmore specific than simple search. Users will expect to have indexes available in \nthe EPUB 3 ecosystem and accessible as easily as search. Publishers of EPUB 3 \ncontent wish to make this data available to users, to allow them to explore book \ncontents  beyond  what  search  results  reveal.\u201d39  Index  entries  are  links  to  por-\ntions of text; these links do not have to \u2013 but of course can \u2013 be a literal extract \nfrom the portion of text, but they are the result of editorial work and might, for \nexample, consist of an hyperonym of one of the key concepts. Future versions \nof EPUB will be able to integrate such indexes, including for reverse use in the \nsense that index entries associated with a range of text can also be viewed.","1219":"\u201cThis EPUB specification defines a model for template-based adaptive paginated \nlayouts as an extension to CSS. The features described in the specification allow \nauthors to describe precise page appearances that adapt to a wide range of device \nsizes and custom user settings. Its primary focus are interactive display environ-\nments in which the page size and user-defined font metrics are unknown at the \ntime of document authoring and layout has to be done on the fly. This specifica-\ntion builds on CSS 2.1 and several CSS3 modules.\u201d40 This feature of future EPUB \nversions addresses the conflict of interests, that on the one hand certain types \nof books have a typical (and mostly also relevant: cf., for example, a cookbook) \nlayout, some settings for which should not be disposable for adaptation by users \nto guarantee the reading experience or a recognition effect, respectively. On the \nother hand, there are different devices available with different screen sizes and \nresolutions \u2013 and of course reader preferences: font, type size, etc. \u2013 that should \nallow for adaptation. This feature defines a process in which content can flow \ndynamically into a set of linked containers based on page templates.","1220":"With respect to options concerning the pre-specification of fonts, font sizes, etc., \nas well as the integration of special fonts for single ebooks, the formats in focus \nare very similar. Concerning the arrangement of text blocks on a page, EPUB \n3 offers the most comprehensive set of controllable parameters. KF8 has limi-\ntations, e.g. concerning the specification of margins as well as of aesthetically \nmotivated  interventions  like  the  aversion  of  so-called  orphans  and  widows. \nMoreover,  the  fixed-layout  option  can  only  be  set  globally,  i.e.  for  the  whole \ndocument. With KF8, positions in the fixed-layout option can be specified using \na percentage-oriented measure (as opposed to a pixel-position oriented one as \nused in EPUB 3), which gives it a higher degree of flexibility for future screens.","1221":"In  all  formats  in  focus,  the  integration  of  HTML\/CSS  tables  is  possible. \nHowever,  the  support  by  the  reader  applications  to  display  tables  nicely \nand  correctly  is  on  an  unsatisfactory  (and  badly  documented)  level.  An \nimportant additional option (JavaScript) to realize complex tables is given \nwith EPUB 3 and .ibooks as well as \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 with Apple\u2019s Fixed \nLayout EPUB.","1222":"Regarding  the  integration  of  covers,  EPUB  3  and  KF8  allow  a  more  flex-\nible  referencing  of  the  cover  file  (relative,  e.g.,  to  the  table  of  content  or \nthe first page of the book) from the spine rather than from the metadata. \nIndependently, the latter solution is offered by all formats in focus, not least \nto ensure downward compatibility with older reader applications.","1223":"Using  the  HTML5  element  <nav>,  EPUB  3  and  KF8  enable  more  flexible \ntables of contents, e.g. ones that have images rather than only text portions \nas active links to sections in the book or that are able to reference the fixed \npage numbers of the underlying printed book. Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB \nand  .ibooks  use  the  less  advanced  and  EPUB-proprietary  (rather  than \nHTML standard based) .ncx file for tables of contents.","1224":"All  data  formats  reviewed  can  integrate  multimedia  content  (audio  and \nvideo), differentiated only by restrictions regarding which audio and video \nformats can be expected to be played back by the appertaining reader appli-\ncations. KF8 is a special case in that audio and video can be integrated into \nthe format as such; these, however, will not be played back on Kindle devices \nat all, but only on the iOS Kindle app on Apple devices.","1225":"EPUB  3  allows  text-to-speech,  controllable  to  a  large  extent  using  stand-\nardized  file  formats,  as  well  as  the  synchronization  of,  for  example,  text \nhighlighting and pre-recorded narration. The latter synchronization is also \nsupported  by  Apple\u2019s  Fixed  Layout  EPUB;  this  format,  however,  does  not \nsupport text-to-speech. KF8 and .ibooks do not offer any of these features.","1226":"EPUB  3  offers  two  fundamental  options  for  dynamic  content  (dialogues, \nanimations), namely one using CSS transform and one using \u2013 essentially \nunrestricted  \u2013  JavaScript;  JavaScript,  however,  is  only  an  option  in  that  it \ncannot  be  expected  to  be  supported  by  every  reader  application.  Apple\u2019s \n.ibooks  format  (as  generated  by  iBooks  Author)  generally  offers  the  same \noptions as EPUB 3 in this area; some of them are presented as options on \niBook Author\u2019s WYSIWYG interface, more complex ones can be integrated \nusing HTML widgets (containing CSS and JavaScript code).

At  the  moment,  there  is  one  single  feature  that \ngives KF8 a slightly higher potential for future developments: its measure-\nment for fixed positions on a screen in fixed-layout contexts is based on per-\ncentage information rather than on absolute pixel positions (as in EPUB\u00a03).","1229":"\f5  Alternative Options\nThe general paradigm of the production and distribution of ebooks, includ-\ning  enhanced  ebooks,  we  have  looked  at  here  is  one  in  which  a  file  that \nencodes the content of the ebook, including its hypertext structure, inter-\nactive  features  and  multimedia,  is  downloaded  by  a  customer  and  stored \nand viewed on his (typically mobile) device. A subtype of this paradigm is \ngiven by a set-up in which this file is not downloaded, but kept on a central \nserver as part of the so-called cloud (and rendered from there). This file is \ndeclarative,  i.e.  it  is  not  a  program  or  an  application,  but  it  just  describes \nthe ebook with all its features; it is written in a special \u201clanguage\u201d, e.g. in \nEPUB 3 or KF8. This description is rendered into an actual ebook with the \nhelp of a reading application that runs on the mobile device and is able to \nhandle this \u201clanguage\u201d or data format respectively, rendering what is on the \nlowest symbolic level of observation just a string of 0s and 1s into something \nthat can be read as a book on a screen. Interoperability issues around this \nparadigm  of  production  and  distribution  of  ebooks  just  presented  are  the \nsubject  of  this  report.  To  roughly  adumbrate  the  bigger  picture,  however, \nwe  would  like  to  introduce  two  alternative  options  for  realizing  digital \nbooks; these are substantially different from the one just presented. The first \nof these alternatives are book apps and the second ebook streaming. Both \nget applied in actual products and projects, but as of now do not have the \nmarket significance of the declarative download-file-and-view paradigm.","1230":"App \u2013 for application \u2013 has become the common name for programs that \nare  developed  especially  for  smartphones  and  tablets.  The  distribution \nchannels  for  these  apps  are  the  so  called  app  stores  of  the  various  mobile \noperating\/\u2018ecosystems\u2019:  iTunes  for  Apple\u2019s  iOS  operating  system,  Google \nPlay for Google\u2019s Android operating system, etc. Mobile apps in this sense \n\u2013 procedural files that do not need reader software to be run, but include \ncontent as well as the reading\/rendering application \u2013 can also be used to \nrealize digital books, and multimedia interactive ones in particular. Typical \ncases for this are children\u2019s books or \u2018books\u2019 with special features like export-\nable annotations. These cannot be realized in the interplay between a book \nas a declarative file (e.g. EPUB 3) on the one hand, and the corresponding \nreader application (over which the originator of the digital book does not \nhave any control) on the other. There are three fundamental ways to produce \n(book) apps \u2013 as native apps, as web apps, or as hybrid apps. Native apps are \nprograms,  pieces  of  software,  that  only  run  on  the  operating  system  they \nare developed for, using native programming languages like Java (Android), \nObjective C (iOS), or .Net (Windows), respectively. To make a title available \non various operating systems, it must be implemented separately for every \nsingle one.","1231":"\fA so-called web app is actually not an application \u2013 it is a declarative file, \nwhich uses the language elements of websites (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) and \ntherefore can be viewed using a web browser, e.g. Safari\/Apple or Chrome\/\nGoogle. This web browser is able to adapt the content to the respective display \nsize and resolution. Web apps typically cannot be run in offline mode, as \nserver-side interactive features cannot be made available. The third case is, \nwhen the declarative book content and the application being able to render \nit (not a web browser) are integrated in an app, a self-containing application; \nthis is a logical requirement for getting distributed via an app store. Such \na combination of website-like content with a proprietary native rendering \napp is called a hybrid app. As with native apps, this opens up the app stores \nas distribution channels to publishers. The advantage of hybrid apps with \nseparated content modules compared to native apps, in which content and \nrendering are inextricably intertwined, is that they can be developed faster, \neasier and hence more economically using so-called app frameworks. Such a \nframework facilitates the methodical (parallel) development of hybrid apps \nfor different operating systems. It offers interfaces which make it possible to \naddress operating system specific functions in a uniform way. This makes \nit possible to develop the content only once per title (using HTML5, CSS, \nJavaScript), which then, using the app framework, can be made available for \ndifferent operating systems without much effort. Remaining advantages of \nnative apps compared to hybrid apps are mainly in the gaming sector, since \ncomplex  graphic  processing  cannot  be  realized  in  a  sufficiently  effective \nmanner using JavaScript (as opposed to Java proper).","1232":"When compared to ebooks in the sense of declarative files (EPUB or one of \nthe proprietary formats) displayed on a reader application, book apps \u2013 be \nthey native or hybrid apps \u2013 allow functions like communicating with other \napplications  like  mail,  messaging  or  phone  applications.  The  same  is  true \nfor the export or the storing of annotations or for the recording of audio. \nBook apps are pretty common in the area of children\u2019s books. It has to be \nremarked, however, that many of the functions (e.g. simple animations) used \nin  such  book  apps  are\/will  be  possible  also  with  EPUB  3.  However,  there \nare no reader applications on the market yet which can display all of these \nfunctions (as we have pointed out several times). For some of the advanced \nfunctions mentioned, book apps are therefore currently the only option.","1233":"Beyond  legal  considerations  when  an  ebook  download  might  be  seen  not \nas a purchase, but only as the use of a license (which is not the topic here), \nthere is a further alternative option to realize ebooks. Rather than download \nebook files and render them (or render them from a file in the cloud), it is \nalso  possible  to  stream  ebook  contents  to  corresponding  viewing  applica-\ntions.  This  option  \u2013  streaming  not  continually,  but  in  a  request-response \ncycle  \u2013  is  used  in  settings,  where  access  to  ebook  contents  is  not  granted \nfor  good,  but  only  for  a  certain  period  of  time,  mostly  in  the  context  of ","1234":"\febook lending or flat rate schemes. Such services are offered by libraries, but \nalso by certain publishers, online bookstores and specialized aggregators. If \nnot taken care of with special mechanisms (e.g. for reading during a flight), \nstreamed ebooks can of course only be read if the device is online. Since the \nstreaming  arrangements  of  different  ebook  streaming  services  are  differ-\nent, they are not interoperable between them. Some of the ebook streaming \nviewing  applications  can,  however,  also  view  downloaded  EPUB  ebooks \n(from the traditional paradigm) and realize basic features with them.","1235":"Many publishers and authors are interested in content protection as ebooks \ncan  easily  be  reproduced  and  distributed.  Digital  rights  management \n(DRM) broadly refers to a set of policies, techniques and tools that guide the \nproper use of digital content [14]. Major functionalities of DRM systems are \npackaging of raw content into an appropriate form for easy distribution and \ntracking,  protecting  the  content  for  tamper-proof  transmission,  protect-\ning content from unauthorized use, and enabling specifications of suitable \nrights, which define the modes of content consumption. Probably the most \nrelevant aspects for publishers and booksellers are that DRM systems allow \nthem [14] ","1236":"Honor  systems  do  not  enforce  protection  by  technical  features,  but  the \ncopyright owner asks users to respect his intellectual property. An example \nis the novel The plant published in 2000 by Stephen King. King did not apply \nany technical DRM measures, but published the novel in separate chapters, \ncontinuing with the next chapter only if a certain number of users pay for the \nchapters already published. With the publication of the last chapter, many \nillegal copies of the book became available, rapidly reducing the willingness \nof the readers to pay for the content. Thus, King stopped the project.","1237":"Digital content can also be protected by creating a closed ecosystem. A closed \necosystem does not allow or makes it at least difficult for users to export or \ndistribute content. An example of a closed ecosystem is Apple\u2019s iTunes Store. \nSince 2009, all music titles sold through the iTunes Store are not protected \nby technical DRM measures. However, the ecosystem is closed as users can \ndownload  or  play  content  only  using  Apple  devices  or  software  (iTunes, \niPhone, iPod, iPad, Apple TV). An export of content out of the Apple world \nis only possible by burning individual songs on a CD. Another instrument ","1238":"\ffor  establishing  closed  ecosystems  is  the  use  of  proprietary  formats.  For \nexample, the .ibooks format produced by the Apple authoring tool iBooks \nAuthor is incompatible with the EPUB 3 standard and can only be accessed \nin  Apple\u2019s  ecosystem  through  the  Apple  iBookstore  using  Apple  devices \n(see Sect.\u00a03.2.2). Although no hard DRM measures are used on the ebook \nfiles, a free distribution of content is not possible as all non-Apple devices \nor software readers cannot read the format. Important for establishing an \neffective closed ecosystem is a tight coupling between a store, where content \nis sold, and devices or software, that display the content.","1239":"A  specific  type  of  DRM  is  digital  watermarking.  Watermarking  does  not \nallow a publisher or ebook distributor to ensure a set of policies but allow \na  posteriori  the  identification  of  users  which  do  not  follow  the  policies. \nWatermarking  inserts  user-specific  or  content-specific  information  into \nvisible  or  invisible  ebook  data  like  cover  page,  figures,  video,  audio  files, \nfonts, or text. Watermarking does not prevent the unauthorized distribution \nand use of ebooks, however, it gives the publisher or distributor the possibil-\nity to reconstruct unauthorized distribution. There are two general types of \nwatermarking: ","1240":"\u2022\t Forensic watermarks are user-specific information embedded in a media \nfile. The embedded information is only accessible if the user knows about \nit. Forensic watermarks are used by publishers or distributors to identify \nwhere the content file originates. Forensic watermarks should be robust \nagainst  removal  attacks  and  identify  information  about  the  copyright \nowner  for  the  watermarked  item.  Usually,  forensic  watermarks  are \nintended to track copies of the data, not to directly prevent the copying.","1241":"\u2022\t Denial watermarks aim to protect content. Examples for audio formats \nare SACD and DVD Audio. Such systems combine watermarking with \nsoftware  protection  (encryption).  End-user  devices  or  software  readers \nsearch  for  a  valid  watermark  in  the  content  and  forbid  access  to  the \ncontent if the watermark is not found. The production of a valid water-\nmark involves secrets (e.g.\u00a0keys) unavailable to the public. ","1242":"Software-based protection using encryption limits the use of content only \nto registered and authorized users. In a standard and representative DRM \nmodel, the content provider prepares the content in a format supported by \nthe DRM system. Then, the digital content is encrypted and packaged for \ndistribution. As discussed in the previous paragraph, the content provider \nmay  add  digital  watermarks  to  the  file  to  allow  the  copyright  owner  to \nidentify ownership of the files. Encrypted documents are not directly useful \nfor consumers as they must be decrypted with a key corresponding to the \nencryption  key.  In  a  next  step,  the  encrypted  content,  together  with  keys \nfor decryption and usage policies (number of copies, pay-per-view, etc.), is \nsent  to  a  clearinghouse.  The  consumer  can  now  stream  or  download  the \nprotected  material  through  the  distributor  or  from  another  source.  To  be \nable  to  view  the  protected  material,  he  must  request  a  valid  licence  from ","1243":"\fthe clearinghouse. The clearinghouse verifies the user\u2019s identity, charges his \naccount  based  on  the  content  usage  rules,  generates  a  transaction  report \nfor the content provider, and delivers a decryption key that allows the user \nto access the content on his\/her device [13]. A usage of content without the \ndecryption key is not possible. To prohibit a usage of content by unauthor-\nized users who get access to the decryption key, the decryption key usually \nallows  decryption  of  content  only  on  specific  devices  (identified  by  their \nserial  ID)  or  for  a  specific  user  (identified  by  a  user  or  account  name).  A \ndecryption  on  other  devices  with  a  different  ID  or  by  other  users  with  a \ndifferent account name is not possible.","1244":"If the clearinghouse is different from the content provider, consumers can \npass  along  received  digital  content  to  other  people  through  super-distri-\nbution [13]. To utilize content, a recipient has to contact the clearinghouse \nand  provide  whatever  information  or  payment  is  required  for  the  license. \nHowever, in many closed ebook ecosystems the content provider is identical \nwith  the  clearinghouse  and  a  free  exchange  of  books  between  consumers \nis not possible. For example, Apple\u2019s iBookstore or Amazon do not use an \nexternal  clearinghouse  and  do  not  allow  the  transfer  of  ebooks  from  one \ncustomer to another. In addition, passing along content to a user outside the \nclosed ecosystems is not offered and not intended.","1245":"Closed ecosystems rely on a tight coupling between ebook store and reading \ndevices. Additional instruments are incompatible formats and software-based \nprotection using encryption and watermarking. In the following paragraphs, \nwe  give  an  overview  about  the  current  software-based  DRM  schemes. \nThere  are  four different DRM schemes available. Three of them are propri-\netary  (Amazon,  Apple\u2019s  FairPlay,  and  Adobe  Digital  Experience  Protection \nTechnology),  whereas  Marlin  is  an  open  standard  developed  by  the  Marlin \nDeveloper Community (MDC). Currently, the four different DRM schemes \nare  non-interoperable.  Thus,  DRM-protected  books  cannot  be  exchanged \nbetween the different DRM systems and ecosystems, respectively.","1246":"Technically, Amazon applies the DRM schemes to the AZW and KF8 format \n(see  Sect.\u00a0 3.3),  where  the  AZW  format  is  an  encrypted  MOBI  format.  For \nKindle devices, Amazon directly encrypts the container format (MOBI). The \nKindle software reader uses a different DRM scheme, which is stronger than \nthe DRM scheme for the Kindle devices, as it uses additional keys for each \nebook instead of only one key decrypting the content on a Kindle device.","1247":"\fThe  Amazon  DRM  ensures  that  DRM-protected  ebooks  can  only  be  read \non  Kindle  devices  or  Amazon\u2019s  reading  software  (available  for  all  major \noperating systems and devices) and non-Amazon ebooks cannot be read on \nany of Amazon\u2019s Kindle devices or reading software. Amazon uses the user \nID to identify a user and only allows the usage of content acquired by the \nuser. Amazon does not allow a permanent transfer of ebooks bought in the \nAmazon Kindle Store to another user or any non-Amazon device or reader. \nSince  January  2011,  users  can  transfer  one  book  for  a  time  period  of  two \nweeks to exactly one other Amazon user.","1248":"Apple uses a DRM scheme named Apple FairPlay. Apple FairPlay is applied \nto  all  content  that  is  sold  through  the  iBookstore  and  built  into  Apple\u2019s \nstandard  multimedia  software  QuickTime,  which  is  used  on  the  iPhone, \niPod, iPad and the software reader iBooks. Apple\u2019s FairPlay DRM is compat-\nible with the formats sold through the iBookstore, namely EPUB, .ibooks, \nand Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB. Analogously to Amazon, all books distrib-\nuted through the iBookstore can only be used on Apple devices and readers.\nHowever, in contrast to Amazon, Apple allows the import of EPUB and PDF \nfiles from non-Apple devices and readers.","1249":"FairPlay  encrypts  the  files  delivered  to  the  customer  and  embeds  digital \nwatermarks  for  identification.  Official  specifications  of  the  DRM  mecha-\nnisms are not publicly available, however there are some technical reports \n[9, 16]. FairPlay allows an unlimited number of copies of an ebook on one \nspecific Apple device and a simultaneous use of an ebook on a maximum \nof  five  authorized  devices.  Meanwhile,  there  are  software  solutions  like \ncalibre41  or  Requiem42  available,  which  allow  users  to  remove  the  DRM \nprotection from books bought in the iBookstore. Of course, removing the \nDRM protection is against Apple\u2019s terms of use.","1250":"Adobe  offers  a  DRM  system  named  Adobe  Digital  Experience  Protection \nTechnology (ADEPT) used by some booksellers and distributors for protecting \nmainly EPUB content. The DRM scheme can be applied to PDF, EPUB, and \nFlash.  The  DRM  scheme  can  be  read  by  Adobe  Digital  Edition,  which  is  an \nebook reader developed by Adobe, and some other third-party ebook readers. \nADEPT is the most commonly used DRM scheme besides Amazon and Apple.","1251":"ADEPT  allows  users  to  exchange  documents  between  up  to  six  comput-\ners.

A  variant  of  ADEPT  is  used \nby  Barnes  &  Noble  for  their  reading  device  Nook  and  reading  software. \nSupported formats in the ebook store of Barnes & Noble are PDF and EPUB. \nAnalogously to Amazon, ADEPT allows the lending of a book for two weeks \nto another user.","1252":"The Marlin Developer Community (MDC) developed an open DRM stand-\nard  named  Marlin43.  MDC  started  in  October  2008  with  five  members: \nIntertrust,  Panasonic,  Philips,  Samsung,  and  Sony.  Currently,  about  30 \ncompanies are members of MDC.

Marlin  allows  a  flexible  and  general-purpose  rights  management \nsimilar to Amazon, FairPlay, and ADEPT. Marlin emphasizes the interop-\nerability  between  various  ecosystems  which  would  allow  users  to  transfer \nebooks from one ecosystem into another. Marlin can also be used for deliv-\nering EPUB files as well as proprietary formats.","1254":"Currently,  the  closed  ecosystems  established  by  Amazon  and  Apple  are \nprotected by the use of proprietary and non-interoperable DRM schemes. \nThe  features  provided  by  Amazon  DRM,  Apple\u2019s  FairPlay,  and  Adobe \nADEPT  are  similar,  however  an  exchange  of  books  from  one  ecosystem \ninto another is not possible.

In principle, any existing \nDRM  scheme  can  be  applied  to  the  ebook  formats  EPUB,  KF8,  as  well  as \nApple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB and .ibooks.

From  a  technical  perspective  this  is  possible,  however,  the \necosystem owner must accept books that are sold outside its ecosystem and \nenforce usage restrictions that have been defined by a different ecosystem. \nFrom the business perspective of the major players in the ebook market, this \nis not attractive. Instead, they use incompatible DRM schemes to prohibit \nthe free exchange of ebooks and to bind users to their own ecosystem.","1257":"\f7  Conclusions\nA free choice on the part of customers between different ebook stores and \nretailers  is  only  possible  if  the  ebook  formats  used  are  interoperable  and \nthe DRM mechanisms allow an easy exchange of files. With these criteria \nin mind, this report studies the interoperability of the major ebook formats \n\u2013 namely EPUB, KF8 (Amazon), Fixed Layout EPUB (Apple) \u2013 and .ibooks \n(Apple) and the interoperability of the DRM mechanisms used by the major \nretailers. From a format perspective, we answer the question whether the use \nof the open standard EPUB would allow publishers and authors to cover the \nsuperset of all functionalities of the proprietary formats KF8, Apple\u2019s Fixed \nLayout EPUB, and .ibooks. From a DRM perspective, we examine what can \nbe said concerning the possible protection of copyrighted material on the \none  hand  and  the  functions  of  DRM  to  close  ecosystems.  The  interesting \nquestion is which DRM schemes allow interoperability between ebook eco-\nsystems.  Both  interoperable  formats  and  interoperable  DRM  mechanisms \nare a prerequisite for customers to have a free choice.","1258":"Consequently, the document starts with a historical overview of the devel-\nopment of the open EPUB standard. This is followed in Sect.\u00a03 by a detailed \nlevel description of the major formats: EPUB 3, Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB \nand  .ibooks,  and  KF8.  Sect.\u00a0 4  changes  the  perspective  and  compares  the \nfeatures provided by the different formats from the perspective of publish-\ners who want to see certain features in their content. This section looks at \ncore  features,  multimedia  and  interactivity,  as  well  as  globalisation  and \naccessibility. Sect.\u00a05 discusses alternative options, e.g. where ebook content \nis not rendered using a dedicated reader software, but content and viewer \nare packaged together as an ebook app. Sect.\u00a06 compares the existing ebook \nDRM schemes; interoperable DRM systems are the second prerequisite of \ninteroperability between different ebook ecosystems.","1259":"\u2022\t With  the  use  of  EPUB  3,  ebook  format  interoperability  is  possible \nbetween different ebook ecosystems. EPUB 3 is not only the format with \nthe highest expressive power, but it includes the superset of all features \nof KF8, Fixed Layout EPUB, and .ibooks. This result is not surprising as \nKF8, Apple\u2019s Fixed Layout EPUB, and .ibooks are descendants of earlier \nEPUB standards using the same or similar data structures.","1260":"\u2022\t Instruments for building up closed ebook ecosystems are a tight coupling \nbetween reader devices and applications on the one hand and the store \non the other, the impossibility of exporting ebooks, and restrictive DRM \nprotection. The ebook retailer Apple supports the open EPUB standard \nand provides with the iBooks reader application one of the best EPUB 3 \nreader  applications.  However,  Apple  established  a  closed  ecosystem,  as \nall ebooks created or distributed inside the Apple world are not allowed \nto leave the ecosystem and cannot be transferred to non-Apple devices. \nApple\u2019s  principal  means  of  creating  this  closed  ecosystem  is  the  Apple ","1261":"\u2022\t Amazon has also built up a closed ecosystem. Analogously to Apple, it does \nnot allow users to export or transfer ebooks to other ecosystems or users. \nThe  Kindle  reader  devices  and  reader  applications  only  display  ebooks \nbought in the Amazon ebook store, and Amazon\u2019s Kindle Store delivers \ncontent only to Amazon reader devices and applications. Analogously to \nApple, the instruments for achieving a closed ecosystem are the impos-\nsibility of exporting ebooks, the tight coupling between reader devices\/\napplications and the store, and DRM protection. Differently from Apple, \nAmazon  does  not  even  support  the  EPUB  standard,  but  uses  its  own \nproprietary and non-interoperable KF8 format. The use of a non-interop-\nerable format strengthens the closeness of its ecosystem as it makes even \nnon-DRM protected KF8 files unusable outside the Amazon ecosystem. ","1262":"There  is  little  official  or  publicly  available  documentation  regarding  the \nformats  KF8,  Apple  Fixed  Layout  EPUB,  and  .ibooks.  Even  on  request, \nApple as well as Amazon did not provide any further technical documenta-\ntion  concerning  the  formats.  Neither  Apple  nor  Amazon  commented  our \nresults, in spite of explicitly being asked by us to do so. In the absence of \ndocumentation  and  as  a  result  of  DRM  protection,  national  libraries  and \nother institutions that preserve cultural heritage do not store ebooks in pro-\nprietary formats. For example, the German National Library only archives \nebooks in EPUB and PDF format.","1263":"In summary, we find that there are no technical or functional reasons not \nto use EPUB 3 as the interoperable ebook standard. Instead, Amazon and \nApple use, propagate, and develop their proprietary formats mainly for mar-\nket-strategic reasons (and possibly downward compatibility). A short-term \nobstacle to widespread use is the non-availability of fully EPUB 3-compatible \nreading applications. This problem, however, should be resolved at the end \nof 2013 when fully EPUB 3-compatible reader applications are scheduled to \nbe available (e.g.\u00a0Kobo, Azardi, or Apple iBooks reader).","1264":"However, a widespread use of EPUB 3 will only lead to interoperable ebook \necosystems, if the currently closed ecosystems become open beyond issues \nof data formats. Open ecosystems would allow users to import and export \nebooks  to  and  from  other  reader  devices  or  reader  applications.  Such  an \nexchange of ebooks between different systems and users makes it necessary \nto also exchange information about the DRM schemes between the differ-\nent ecosystems. From a technical perspective, this is possible as the DRM \nfeatures provided by the existing proprietary DRM schemes are similar and \nthere even exists an open source DRM system (Marlin) aiming for interop-\nerability and openness. However, the current business models of the main \nplayers  in  the  ebook  market  aiming  at  lock-in  effects  for  the  customer  do \nnot fit with open ecosystems. A prominent example is Apple, which actively ","1265":"\fsupports the EPUB 3 standard and uses it for some of its ebook distribution, \nbut keeps its ecosystem closed by the use of a DRM system which restricts \nthe exchange of files, including of course ebooks. To reach true interoper-\nability in the ebook market, the major retailers must agree on interoperable \nebook formats and interoperable DRM schemes.","1266":"We  would  like  to  express  our  sincere  thanks  to  the  staff  of  the  IDPF,  the \nBISG,  of  book-related  associations  from  several  countries  as  well  as  of \nvarious enterprises in the ebook business.

Top  Shelf \ndid more than $23 million in sales in 2018. ","1276":"Today  that  seems  like  a  distant  dream.  Mrdeza  has  had \nto  lay  off  all  but  five  employees  and  is  working  to  avoid \nbankruptcy. What doomed Mrdeza\u2019s business was Amazon\u2019s \nmarket power. Like most e-commerce businesses, Top Shelf \nBrands has to go through Amazon to reach the vast majority \nof  its  customers.  That\u2019s  because  more  than  60  percent  of \nAmericans  who  want  to  buy  something  online  start  their \nproduct  search  on  Amazon,  rather  than  a  search  engine.1 \nIn 15 of 23 major product categories, Amazon is capturing \nmore than 70 percent of online transactions.2 Although Top \nShelf also sells on Walmart and eBay, these platforms are a \nvery distant second and third in traffic to Amazon, and they \ngenerate  only  a  small  sliver  of  Top  Shelf\u2019s  sales.  In  other \nwords, Amazon so dominates online shopping traffic that it \nhas become a gatekeeper. ","1277":"As  this  report  shows,  Amazon  is  exploiting  its  gatekeeper \npower to siphon off a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue \nearned  by  independent  sellers  on  its  site.  It\u2019s  doing  this \nthrough  the  fees  that  it  charges  them.  In  effect, Amazon  is \nlevying a hefty tax on their trade \u2014 enabling it to profit from \ntheir businesses at the same time that it saddles them with \nmore  costs  and  thus  weakens  them  as  rivals.  Over  the  last \nfive years, Amazon\u2019s revenue from seller fees grew roughly \ntwice  as  fast  as  its  overall  sales.  Seller  fees  netted Amazon \nalmost $60 billion in 2019 \u2014 nearly double the $35 billion in \nrevenue from its massive cloud computing division, Amazon \nWeb Services (AWS).

As \nAmazon  pocketed  more  of  its  revenue,  Top  Shelf  slipped \nfrom  being  modestly  profitable  to  losing  money.  Even  as \nsales  were  soaring  in  2018, Top  Shelf  was  deep  in  the  red. \nMrdeza  found  that  raising  the  prices  of  his  products  on \nAmazon\u2019s  site  to  account  for  these  added  costs  wasn\u2019t  an \noption. That\u2019s because if a seller offers a product at a higher \nprice on Amazon than it charges on other platforms, Amazon \npenalizes  the  business  by  suppressing  the  visibility  of  its \nproducts and dramatically reducing their sales.3 ","1280":"Mrdeza\u2019s story is a familiar one to the tens of thousands of \nsmall businesses that have tried to succeed in an e-commerce \nmarket  dominated  by  Amazon.

And if that pipeline falters, Amazon \nalready  has  another  one  in  place.  In  2013,  the  company \nbegan cultivating sellers in China and has set up an ocean \nshipping  operation  that  allows  sellers  there  to  feed  their \ngoods  directly  into  Amazon\u2019s  U.S.  distribution  system.6  By \nJanuary 2020, China-based sellers accounted for 49 percent \nof the top 10,000 sellers in Amazon\u2019s U.S. marketplace.7 ","1283":"Last year, in his annual letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO \nJeff  Bezos  reported  that  third-party  sellers  accounted  for \n58  percent  of  sales  on  Amazon,  up  from  46  percent  five \nyears  before.  Then,  in  reference  to  the  growth  of  these \nsales relative to sales by Amazon\u2019s own retail division (\u201cfirst-\nparty\u201d  sales),  he  said:  \u201cThird-party  sellers  are  kicking  our \nfirst-party butt.\u201d","1284":"It  was  a  smugly  condescending  remark,  made  from  the \nvantage point of having firm control over the fates of third-\nparty  sellers.  Through  its  algorithms,  which  control  search \nand product pages, and its fee structures and other dictates, \nAmazon can steer consumers to third-party sellers, or to the \nproducts  it\u2019s  selling  itself,  depending  on  which  best  serves \nits  own  interests.  It  has  allowed  third-party  sales  to  grow \nbecause  they\u2019re  extremely  lucrative,  and  because  Amazon \ncan  leverage  its  power  over  these  smaller  businesses  to \nexpand its market dominance. ","1285":"With third-party sales, Amazon takes its cut right off the top, \nregardless  of  the  seller\u2019s  costs  and  margins.  It  incurs  none \nof the expenses of researching and sourcing products and \ninvesting  in  inventory,  and  carries  none  of  the  risk  that  the \ngoods won\u2019t sell. Just as Amazon uses temporary and \u201cgig\u201d \nworkers  to  dodge  costs  and  responsibility  in  its  logistics \noperations, it uses third-party sellers to offload the expense \nof  inventory,  while  profiting  from  their  product  knowledge, \nmarket insights, and entrepreneurial drive. ","1286":"Our  analysis  finds  that,  last  year,  Amazon  netted  nearly  $60 \nbillion from the tolls it levied on third-party sellers, including \nreferral  fees,  storage  and  shipping  fees,  advertising,  and \nother charges.8 That\u2019s significantly more than the $35 billion \nin revenue the tech giant earned from Amazon Web Services \n(AWS), \nits  massive  cloud  computing  operation,  which \ncontrols nearly half of the world\u2019s public cloud capacity and \nprovides the computing infrastructure for a huge number of \ncorporations.9 Seller fees accounted for more than one-fifth of \nAmazon\u2019s total revenue in 2019, up from 14 percent in 2014.","1287":"Over  the  last  five  years, Amazon\u2019s  revenue  from  seller  fees \nhas  grown  two-and-a-half  times  as  fast  as  total  consumer \nspending on its site. In other words, Amazon\u2019s fee revenue \nis increasing in large part because it is taking a larger cut of \nevery  dollar  sellers  make  on  the  site.  Five  years  ago,  third-\nparty  sellers  handed  Amazon  about  $19  of  every  $100  in \nsales they made on the site. Today, it\u2019s over $30. ","1288":"But  in  2018,  even  as  his  sales  were  soaring,  Mrdeza\u2019s  business \nwas failing \u2014 in large part because of Amazon itself. Amazon was \npocketing a growing share of Top Shelf\u2019s sales through the fees it \ncharged the company. The fees for FBA, Amazon\u2019s warehousing \nand shipping service, had shot up. And, as Amazon turned over \nmore of the real estate on its site to sponsored product ads, Top \nShelf found it had to buy ads from Amazon to reach customers, \nwhich meant more fees. ","1289":"When  Mrdeza  was  just  starting  out,  in  2014,  Amazon  fees  ate \nup  35  percent  of  Top  Shelf\u2019s  revenue.

After  Top  Shelf  paid  its \nsuppliers, that left just 13 percent of its revenue to cover payroll \nand the rest of its expenses. In other words, Amazon was netting \nsignificantly  more  revenue  from  Top  Shelf\u2019s  business  than  the \ncompany and its employees were. Top Shelf eked out a modest \nprofit  in  2016  and  2017,  but  by  2018,  it  was  losing  money. \nAlthough Mrdeza tried to expand sales on other platforms, such \nas EBay, and its own site, more than 90 percent of its revenue was \ncoming from Amazon.","1290":"On top of paying Amazon\u2019s rising tolls, Mrdeza and his staff were \nspending  a  lot  of  time  correcting  errors  in  Amazon\u2019s  system  \u2014 \nerrors  that  always  seemed  to  fall  in  Amazon\u2019s  favor.

In  2019, \nAmazon delivered 2.5 billion parcels, or about one-fifth of all \ne-commerce deliveries, according to an analysis by Morgan \nStanley, which expects Amazon to overtake UPS and FedEx in \nmarket share by 2022.24 It\u2019s already overtaken the U.S. Postal \nService, which, last year, saw its parcel volume fall for the first \ntime in nearly a decade, adding to its financial woes.25 ","1313":"To further fortify its position in logistics, Amazon has curtailed \nSeller Fulfilled Prime (SFP), a program that allows elite sellers \nto  earn  the  Prime  badge  if  they  can  consistently  meet  the \n2-day shipping time using other carriers. Amazon launched \nthe program in 2015, before it had built out its own package \ndelivery capacity. In February 2019, it stopped allowing new \nsellers to sign up.26 Then, last fall, Amazon began threatening \nto revoke the Prime status of some SFP sellers, citing minor \ninfractions, unless they switched from buying postage from \nthe  U.S.  Postal  Service  to  buying  it  from  Amazon,  often \nat  higher  rates.27  Then  in  December,  at  the  height  of  the \nholiday season, Amazon told SFP sellers that they could not \nship Prime orders via FedEx\u2019s ground service and could only \nuse its more expensive express service.28 ","1314":"This  tactic  has  enabled  Amazon  to  rapidly  gain  market \nshare  in  the  logistics  sector  without  having  to  compete  for \nit. When Amazon first launched FBA, it stored products and \npacked orders in its warehouses, but relied on other carriers, \nincluding the U.S. Postal Service, UPS, and FedEx, to handle \nshipping  and  delivery.  That\u2019s  changed.  Today,  a  growing \nshare  of  the  products  sold  on Amazon  are  shipped  by  the \ncompany itself.

According \nto data from market-research firm Rakuten Intelligence, the \nshare of Amazon packages arriving late tripled between 2017 \nand 2019, rising to 16.6 percent of orders.29 But SFP sellers \nwho have a few delays can suddenly find themselves losing \ntheir  Prime  badge  or  even  having  their  selling  accounts \nsuspended altogether.

In other words, these \ntwo parts of Amazon are functioning as a monopoly feedback \nloop. Here\u2019s one example of how this works. For many sellers, \nAmazon fulfills all of their orders, including those generated \non other sites, such as EBay. This is because it\u2019s not affordable \nor feasible for these small businesses to maintain sufficient \ninventory  across  warehouses  in  more  than  one  system. \nAmazon compels them to use FBA and then charges much \nhigher prices to pack and ship their \u201cmulti-channel\u201d orders. \nIt charges 66 percent more, for example, to ship a modestly \nsized  item,  such  as  a  shirt  or  a  book,  purchased  on  EBay \nthan one ordered on Amazon. Through its logistics division, \nAmazon bolsters its e-commerce dominance by raising the \ncost of selling on other platforms, while also reaping valuable \ninsights about sales made through these other channels.

It\u2019s about control,\u201d White says. \u201cAmazon knows \nit  can  always  be  getting  maximum  value  if  it  controls  that \nentire chain from payment through delivery.\u201d ","1318":"Amazon\u2019s advertising business is its latest tool for squeezing \nmore revenue from the small businesses that depend on its \nsite  to  reach  customers.  Just  as  Amazon  has  done  with  its \nfulfilment  business,  it  is  increasingly  tying  a  seller\u2019s  ability \nto  generate  sales,  and  thus  its  survival,  to  the  purchase  of \nadvertising on its site.

(The  remainder  of  Amazon\u2019s  sponsored  advertising \nrevenue  comes  from  brands  that  are  supplying  Amazon\u2019s \nretail division as vendors.) ","1320":"As with every component of Amazon\u2019s marketplace strategy, \nits  advertising  business  is  structured  to  reinforce  its  other \nmechanisms  of  dominance  and  extraction.

As  more  orders  are  driven  by \nads, sellers than don\u2019t advertise lose out on those sales and, \nas  their  share  of  sales  declines,  they  also  slip  in  the  search \nrankings, further reducing their sales in a negative cycle.

","1333":"Amazon\u2019s scale of operation and share of the market for book distribution has reached the point \nthat no publisher can afford to be absent from its online store.  A year ago, the New York Times \nreported that Amazon controlled 50% of all book distribution, but for some industry suppliers, \nthe actual figure may be much higher, with Amazon accounting for more than 70 or 80 percent \nof sales.  Whether it is the negative impact on booksellers of Amazon forcing publishers to \npredominantly use its platform, the hostile environment for booksellers on Amazon who see no \nchoice but to sell there, or Amazon\u2019s predatory pricing, the point is that Amazon\u2019s concomitant \nmarket dominance allows it to engage in systematic below-cost pricing of books to squash \ncompetition in the book selling industry as a whole.  Remarkably, what this means is that even \nbooksellers that avoid selling on Amazon cannot avoid suffering the consequences of Amazon\u2019s \nmarket dominance.  The ongoing COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating the problem:  it continues to \nthreaten the financial well-being of authors, publishers, and booksellers, some of whom will not \nsurvive the year.  Amazon, by contrast, with its ever-extensive operation and data network, has \ngrown only more dominant, enjoying its largest-ever quarterly profits during April, May and June. ","1334":"As many antitrust experts have articulated, Amazon has aggressively exercised its market \npower against both suppliers and customers, and it possesses an unhealthy degree of control \nover the fate of other companies.  To be clear, this market power stems not only from Amazon\u2019s \nshare of the market for book distribution, but also from the astonishing level of data that it \ncollects across its entire platform.  Amazon tracks and uses data that provides it with an ","1335":"incredible amount of information about individuals and how to target them, such as:  what their \ninterests are; what products or books they have bought or pre-ordered; from whom; at what \nprice point; what they have perused or considered purchasing; what video-games they are \nplaying; and what television shows or movies they are watching.  The result is that Amazon no \nlonger competes on a level playing field when it comes to book distribution, but, rather, owns \nand manipulates the playing field, leveraging practices from across its platform that appear to be \nwell outside of fair and transparent competition. ","1336":"Members of the Subcommittee would surely agree that a robust, diverse, and competitive \npublishing industry is profoundly important to the United States.  Indeed, publishing is \nintertwined with the founding and Constitutional underpinnings of the Nation, and the publishing \nindustry seeks to serve the interests and expectations of American readers who want a wide \nand unfiltered spectrum of books\u2014from comprehensive political commentary to essential \nhistorical accounts to award-winning literature for both children and adults.  As Rohit Chopra \nsaid in his Remarks at the Silicon Flatirons Conference, University of Colorado Law School, on \nFebruary 10, 2019: \u201cWe will never know what damage has already been done.  What books will \nnever be written?  What ideas will never see the light of day?  Moving forward, we need to ask \nourselves what these developments mean for our democratic values.  We need to make sure \nthat technology is propelling our democracy, not holding it back.\u201d    ","1337":"As to the publishing industry, we believe that Amazon acts anti-competitively in multiple ways, \ndictating the economic terms of its relationships with suppliers so that publishers, their authors, \nand the booksellers who sell on Amazon pay more each year for Amazon\u2019s distribution and \nadvertising services but receive less each year in return.  Amazon employs non-transparent \ndata algorithms and recommendation engines to steer consumers toward Amazon\u2019s own \nproducts, or even toward infringing products without disclosing to consumers that it is doing so. \nIt has required suppliers to agree to most-favored-nation provisions (MFNs) that stifle the \nemergence and growth of competitive alternatives in the book distribution marketplace.  And it \nmanipulates suppliers and rivals by tying the purchase of distribution services to the purchase of \nits advertising services.   ","1338":"1.  Prohibit Amazon from Leveraging Data from the Operation of its Online Platform to \nCompete with and Disadvantage the Suppliers Doing Business There: \nThe authors, publishers, and booksellers that sell on Amazon\u2019s platform are forced to do \nbusiness in direct competition with Amazon\u2019s myriad proprietary products but with very little \ninsight into what Amazon is doing.  As discussed in a variety of submissions to government \nagencies and at agency hearings during the past year, Amazon employs opaque algorithms, \nsearch and discovery tools on its platform, and then uses the data it collects from its suppliers \nand platform customers to manipulate greater leverage and greater profits for its own interests.  \nThe data that Amazon collects from across its platform not only gives Amazon leverage over its \nbook suppliers, it also gives Amazon an insurmountable lead over any would-be distribution \nrivals\u2014a lead so daunting that, at this point, absent government intervention, there is no \npossibility of meaningful competition from anyone, whether they be publishers, booksellers, or \nemerging platforms.  Additionally, some of Amazon\u2019s tools steer customers to sellers of \ninfringing books, deceptive summaries, counterfeits, and other unauthorized copies that \ncompete with legitimate sales.  ","1339":"2. Prohibit Amazon from Tying Distribution Services to the Purchase of Advertising \nServices:  Amazon offers two distinct services to the authors, publishers and booksellers that \nsupply and sell books through its online bookstore, but brazenly ties them together so that \nsuppliers must spend advertising dollars in order to make distribution services viable.  \nDistribution services include helping customers find and purchase books on the Amazon \nplatform, shipping, handling, and delivery of the books (physical and\/or digital), customer \nservice, and collection and remittance of proceeds, for which the operator of the platform \nreceives compensation from its suppliers.  Advertising services, on the other hand, are designed \nto maximize the placement of advertisements to consumers at various points of the search and \npurchase experience\u2014for example, through targeted or sponsored feeds.  Offered separately, \nboth distribution and advertising are valuable services that authors, publishers, and booksellers \nwill consider and decide to purchase under competitive market conditions.  But in instances \nwhere Amazon manipulates discovery tools to make a supplier\u2019s books difficult to find without \nthe purchase of advertising or refuses distribution unless the supplier also purchases \nadvertising, Amazon can extract both unwanted purchases and supra-competitive prices from \nsuppliers.  It also disadvantages rivals by directing valuable advertising dollars to its own \ndominant business.  We believe such tactics are anticompetitive because they allow Amazon to \ncontrol its suppliers and prevent the emergence and growth of would-be rivals.   ","1340":"3. Prohibit Amazon from Imposing MFNs and Other Parity Provisions: While MFNs and \nparity provisions are not inherently anti-competitive, Amazon\u2019s use of such provisions against \npublishers has been, and it has had a direct impact on authors, booksellers, and other \ncompetitors.  For example, through MFNs, Amazon has required publishers to a) offer Amazon \nsimilar or better economic terms and conditions as those offered to any competing distributors; \nb) inform Amazon about more favorable or alternative terms given to competitors; and c) restrict \npricing discounts to consumers.  To provide some additional context, we note that Amazon has \nimposed conditions that affect wholesale and agency prices, sales commissions, discount and \ncredit terms, the availability of books, book features, alternative distribution models, and \npromotional offerings.  Because of Amazon\u2019s market power, these contractual requirements \nhave the effect of preventing rival distributors, including new entrants, from bargaining with \nsuppliers for lower prices, different business models, promotional advantages, or even from \noffering customers lower prices on their own.  Lawmakers should be concerned that Amazon \nimposes MFNs and other parity provisions to eliminate the ability of rivals or new entrants to \ngain any meaningful competitive advantage relative to Amazon, and extremely wary of \npermitting Amazon to regulate itself as to whether, when, and against whom it will impose or \nenforce such provisions.  ","1341":"4. Prohibit Amazon from Using Loss-Leader Pricing to Harm Competition: For over two \ndecades, Amazon has used books as loss leaders in the book industry to lure consumers to its \nwebsite, gather data, make profits on bigger ticket items, and capture an increasing market \nshare.  Despite innovation in the independent bookselling world, independent bookstores find \nthemselves struggling to compete with a company that historically sells books at a loss to that \nend.  Amazon has garnered the bulk of the online book market through loss leader pricing, \nincluding by offering books below cost in order to promote and sell its proprietary Kindle device.  \nImportantly, Amazon\u2019s use of pricing tactics in the book industry reveals that one of its core \nbusiness strategies is one used by monopolies for over a century \u2013 underselling the competition \nto monopolize markets.  Amazon is now using similar pricing tactics to harm competitors in \nother markets, such as the third-party platform market. ","1342":"Shaoul Sussman of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance reports that Amazon is the largest \nnegative cash flow firm in the world, and that these types of companies \u201ccan achieve greater \nmarket share\u201d through this type of pricing strategy, which involve \u201clong-term, below-average \nvariable cost prices.\u201d Sussman stresses that the negative impact of this behavior is the \nelimination of present and future competition.  This has certainly been the case in the \nbookselling world, where Amazon\u2019s strategy has been indirectly or directly responsible for the \nclosure of countless bookstores.   As it employs this pricing strategy in other markets, we are \nseeing the same impact on business sectors ranging from hardware stores to malls.   ","1343":"The Subcommittee\u2019s work has shown that Amazon holds an outsized position of power and \ncontrol in our country, giving it the ability to interfere with the free flow of information, ideas and \nliterature on a large scale.  With great appreciation for your leadership, we note that the \nAmerican book publishing industry is and always has been uniquely intertwined with our \ndemocracy.  Many authors, publishers, and booksellers along the way have contributed to the \nmarketplace of ideas, and we hope that many more will emerge and thrive to the benefit of the \npublic.  This will not happen, however, unless government officials step in decisively to exercise \nappropriate governance of Amazon.

The  role  of  the  vehicle  manufacturer  as  the \nself-appointed \u2018gate-keeper\u2019 is also illustrated by the restricted access to in-vehicle data via the \nphysical On-Board-Diagnostics (OBD) port, which is already being arbitrarily imposed.","1350":"The key principle should be to provide equal abilities as those available to the vehicle manufac-\nturer. As an example, we believe that these abilities are feasible with an \u2018in-vehicle interoperable, \nstandardised, secure and open-access platform\u2019 (OTP) and its inherent security. It was presented \nin the Commission\u2019s TRL Study Report3  and supported by independent studies (e.g. the Oversee \nreport4). Such a telematics system allows independent applications to be safely and securely imple-\nmented in the vehicle to optimise in-vehicle data processing, whilst supporting at the same time \ndecentralised communication to\/from the vehicle with alternative service providers obtaining di-\nrect consumer consent. This avoids the obligation to first have to  sign a data transfer contract  \nwith the vehicle manufacturer (due to the systemic design of the ExVe).

The  NCT  proposal \nenvisages  a  significant  expansion  of  the  Commission\u2019s  existing  powers, \npotentially including the power to impose extensive behavioural and structural \nremedies  absent  an  infringement  decision.  The  NCT  will  empower  the \nCommission to change the structure of a market even where the players active \non  that  market  behave  in  full  compliance  with  the  legal  requirements  of \nArticles 101  and  102  TFEU  as  well  as  with  merger  control  rules.  The \nintroduction of the NCT is therefore bound to have far-reaching implications \u2013 \ngoing far beyond those of established investigation and sector inquiry tools \u2013 \nand is likely to result in a paradigm shift in EU competition law enforcement.

Our  observations  in this  submission therefore  address  the  following \nmore fundamental issues with respect to the NCT proposal:  ","1358":"In  assessing  and  designing  the  NCT,  it  is  imperative  that  the  Commission \nconsiders and clearly delineates the scope of the NCT and its relationship with \nexisting competition rules. It is crucial that the Commission clearly defines in \nconcrete terms the scope of the issues the NCT is seeking to address and any \nalleged enforcement gap to prevent this tool from jeopardising the credibility \nand quality of the current globally respected competition infrastructure within \nthe EU. ","1359":"There is a powerful argument to be made that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (and \ntheir  predecessors)  have  stood  the  test  of  time,  operating  effectively  as  the \ncornerstones of EU competition law and policy for more than 50 years, and have \nproven  to  be  sufficiently  broad  and  malleable  to  address  a  host  of  evolving \neconomic  trends  and  technological  developments  over  that  time.  Indeed,  the \nexisting legal structure has been adaptable and able to address novel issues, in \nparticular in the technology space.

[\u2026] \nThe fundamental  motives,  like greed and fear,  that tempt companies  to harm \ncompetition are the same as they\u2019ve ever been \u2013 and the competition rules are \nstill well designed to deal with them\u2019.7  ","1361":"The  Commission  should  therefore  exercise  considerable  caution  in  deciding \nwhether the NCT is actually needed and, if it is, carefully consider and identify \nany  potential  \u2018gap  cases\u2019  in  clearly  defined  circumstances  that  cannot  be \naddressed by existing rules. In this context we also note that the 2019 report by \nthe Special Advisers to DG COMP calls for the application of existing tools of \nEU competition law enforcement to be refined and adapted to the challenges of \nthe digital age but does not advocate for something of the calibre of the NCT.8 ","1362":"The idea that  certain markets  are prone to  \u2018tipping\u2019, where  the  \u2018winner takes \nmost\u2019, stands out as a particularly speculative basis for the introduction of new \nlegislation. While this \u2018phenomenon\u2019 has been discussed, among others, in the \nFurman Report9 and the Special Advisers\u2019 Report, we question whether market \n\u2018tipping\u2019  \u2013  and  the  extent  to  which  it  does  in  fact  take  place  \u2013  has  been \nsufficiently  analysed  to  legitimise  the  Commission\u2019s  far-reaching  and  highly \nintrusive  NCT  proposal.

Absent the use of intrusive \nremedies (such as \u2018market share caps\u2019) to maintain a particular market structure \n(which  would  be  rather  draconian  and  have  unknown  and  likely  negative \nconsequences),  any  intervention  would  risk  a  regulator  simply  picking  the \n\u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018losers\u2019 in a market in an arbitrary fashion.

Again,  this  seems  rather  speculative  and  there  is  no \nevidence (or examples) provided of what this type of conduct would entail or \nwhy  it  is  considered  unambiguously  detrimental.  Indeed,  such  \u2018unilateral \nstrategies\u2019  seem  to  be  another  way  of  describing  companies  seeking  to  grow \ntheir market position; it is unclear why this is conduct that would merit intrusive \nintervention via the NCT. ","1366":"Although Article 102 TFEU, in contrast to Section 2 of the Sherman Act 1890,  \ndoes  not  cover  attempts  to  dominate\/monopolise  a  market,  its  scope  is  in \npractice  just  as  broad  (if  not  broader)  given  that  dominance  can  be  (and  has \npreviously been) found by the Commission at market shares lower than 40%.10 \nMoreover, Article 102 TFEU has proven particularly versatile and flexible in \nbeing able to deal with attempts by dominant companies to abusively exercise \ntheir market power in vertically-related or adjacent markets (see for example \nTetra Pak II11). Recent infringement decisions (such as Google Shopping) and \nongoing  investigations  by  the  Commission  (such  as  the  investigation  into \nAmazon Marketplace) illustrate that Article 102 TFEU is already an effective \ntool available to the Commission to tackle a wide range of practices relevant to \nperceived \u2018tipping\u2019 concerns.

The  types  of  conduct  mentioned  by  the \nCommission appear indistinguishable from successful organic growth as a result \nof innovation and competition on the merits. Given the importance of scale and \nnetwork  effects  in  some  of  the  markets  targeted  by  the  NCT,  seeking  to \nintervene in a speculative and unpredictable fashion risks stifling competition \nbetween  companies  (including  European  firms)  in  evolving  and  innovative \nmarkets.

","1373":"2.17  The  IIA  explains  that  the  NCT  is  aimed  at  tackling  \u2018structural  competition \nproblems\u2019 that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU \u2018cannot tackle (e.g. monopolisation \nstrategies by non-dominant companies with market power) or cannot address \nin  the  most  effective  manner  (e.g.  parallel  leveraging strategies  by dominant \ncompanies into multiple adjacent markets).\u201916 ","1374":"2.18  To justify the introduction of the NCT, the Commission needs to identify clearly \nhow any \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 that constitute so-called \u2018gap cases\u2019 \narise and why they cannot be effectively addressed under Articles 101 and\/or \n102 TFEU. In this regard, as noted by the Commission in the IIA, there is an \nongoing debate and no clear consensus as to whether there any enforcement gap \nexists.17  ","1375":"If the goal is to enable the Commission to act swiftly, the NCT is unlikely to be \nan effective solution. It takes time to adopt new legislation at the EU level and \nthere will likely be legal challenges throughout the process. There is now rich \njurisprudence  in  the  case  law  of  the  European  Courts  on  the  application  of \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU which provides the Commission with a solid legal \nbasis to develop its enforcement priorities with legal certainty. By contrast, even \nfollowing  the  enactment  of  any  new  law,  its  scope  and  application  can  be \nexpected to be rigorously tested in the courts since there will be no similar body \nof case law or decisional practice against which any decisions under the NCT \ncan be assessed. This can be expected to increase rather than speed up, the time \ntaken for investigations and any remedies to be implemented. Furthermore, as \ndescribed below, the UK markets regime shows that market investigations are \ntime-consuming,  resource-intensive  and  take  a  long  period  to  achieve  their \nintended outcome (if achieved at all). This is in stark contrast with the power to \nimpose interim measures already available to the Commission when carrying ","1376":"2.21  The  UK  has  long  had  a  markets  regime.  Market  investigations  are  detailed \nexaminations into whether particular features of a market give rise to an adverse \neffect  on  competition  and,  if  so,  what  remedial  action  may  be  appropriate. \nSimilar to the proposed NCT, the markets regime sits separately to the CMA\u2019s \ncompetition enforcement powers and enables the CMA to investigate a market \nwithout needing to find that a firm (or group of firms) has infringed competition \nlaw. ","1377":"(a)  With  regard  to  digital  markets,  with  which  the  NCT  is  particularly \nconcerned, the CMA has recently conducted initial market studies into: \n(i) online platforms and digital advertising; and (ii) digital comparison \ntools. However, in both cases, the CMA decided not to open a market \ninvestigation.  Instead  the  outcomes  of  these  market  studies  were \nprimarily a series of recommendations to the UK Government and other \nsector regulators in the UK which the CMA considered would be more \neffective than acting itself under the market investigation regime. ","1378":"(b)  While the CMA has previously utilised market investigations to attempt \nto  tackle  some  of  the  issues  set  out  in  the  Questionnaire  around  a \n\u2018structural  lack  of  competition\u2019  (e.g.  markets  displaying  certain \nstructural features, such as high concentration and entry barriers), it has \nnot been used in any meaningful capacity to address so-called \u2018structural \nrisks  for  competition\u2019  as  described  in  the  IIA.  Therefore,  the \nCommission should exercise caution in using the UK\u2019s markets regime \nas  a  basis  for  justifying  the  use  of  the  NCT  to  address  so-called \n\u2018structural risks for competition\u2019.

Remedies imposed in the banking industry \nhave  been  time-consuming  and  extremely  onerous  for  industry  participants. \nIndeed,  the  costs  imposed  on  the  industry  likely  outweigh  the  financial \nimplications  of  fining  decisions  taken  by  the  CMA  to  date  under  existing \ncompetition law. Likewise, the effectiveness, timeliness and appropriateness of \nthe CMA\u2019s recent actions in its investigation of statutory audit services is widely \ndebated  in the UK. What is  beyond doubt  is  that each  of these inquiries  was \nonerous  and  resource  intensive  for  the  CMA  and  the  industries  involved.  A \nfurther  limitation  of  using  market  investigations  as  the  legal  basis  for  a  pro-\ncompetition  approach  is  that  its  remedies  are  largely  static.  Binding  orders \ncannot be revised and updated as the nature of fast-developing markets and\/or \npotential solutions evolve.21 ","1380":"2.25  More generally, there are good reasons to doubt the effectiveness of structural \nremedies imposed by an agency or court in improving performance in a market. \nConcerns may exist as to whether such remedies can be timely (given the length \nof time required for any investigation or proceeding to conclude and the market \nchanges that may occur during that period) or adequate due the complexity and \ndifficulty of crafting appropriate remedies (at least outside the merger context). \nSuch remedies are, in any event, available to the Commission under Regulation \n1\/2003,  both  when  adopting  an  infringement  decision  or  a  commitments \ndecision. ","1381":"2.26  The experience from the UK markets regime is that a meaningful fact-finding \ninquiry takes close to three years before the CMA is in a position to order the \ntypes  of  remedies  being  envisaged  with  the  NCT.  For  example,  the  CMA \ncommenced its market study work into retail banking in June 2013, and it took \nover three years before the CMA published its final report for its retail banking \nmarket investigation in August 2016 (with the remedies still in the process of \nbeing fully implemented to this day).22 This timeline indicates that significant \ntime is required to conduct a proper fact-finding inquiry. While the CMA has \nrecently  sought  to  streamline  the  process,  the  CMA\u2019s  investigation  into  the \ninvestment consulting sector still took 15 months to complete (and was on the \nback of an earlier market study by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority that \nlasted around one and a half years).23 Given the consequences that flow from \nthe  use  of  the  UK\u2019s  markets  regime,  a  thorough  exercise  of  fact-finding  and \nengagement is essential to ensure that the rights of parties are safeguarded. ","1382":"As  currently  provided  for  in  the  IIA,  the  legal  basis  for  the  NCT Regulation \nwould  be  a  combination  of  Articles  103  and  114  TFEU.  In  our  view, \nArticles 103  and  114  TFEU  \u2013  which  also  formed  the  legal  basis  for  the  EU \nDamages  Directive  2014\/104\/EU  \u2013  appear  insufficient  to  support  the \nCommission\u2019s far-reaching proposal for an NCT, raising serious questions as to \nthe constitutionality of the Commission\u2019s initiative, as currently proposed.   ","1383":"Article  103  TFEU  enables  the  adoption  of  legislation  to  \u2018give  effect  to  the \nprinciples  set  out  in  Articles  101  and  102\u2019  and  address  restrictions  of \ncompetition.  The  NCT  is  however  aimed  at  creating  new  competition \nenforcement  powers  that  may  be  used  \u2018without  any  prior  finding  of  an \ninfringement\u2019 of Articles 101 and\/or 102 TFEU. Hence, the NCT cannot be said \n\u2018to give effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102\u2019 as reflected in \nArticle 103 (1) TFEU. In contrast, the EU Damages Directive codified the EU \nlegal  framework  of  established  case  law  on  the  private  enforcement  of \nArticles 101 (and 102) TFEU since the Courage and Crehan case law of the \nCJEU,24 and therefore clearly fell within the ambit of Article 103 (2) (e) TFEU.   ","1384":"Article  114  TFEU  forms  the  legal  basis  for  the  EU  to  adopt  legislation  to \nharmonise national laws of the Member States that may hinder free movement \nof goods, services, capital or people and therefore obstruct the internal market. \nWhilst Article 114 TFEU is traditionally regarded as a broad legal basis for the \nEU to take legislative action, we question the validity of Article 114 TFEU as a \nlegal  basis  for  the  potential  introduction  of  an  NCT  as  proposed  by  the \nCommission.  Whilst  certain  Member  States  have,  or  are  in  the  process  of, \nenacting new laws to adapt the application of their competition legislation to \ndigital  markets,  these  proposals  relate  to  infringements  of  Articles  101 \nand 102 TFEU  and  their  national  equivalents,  as  opposed  to  purportedly \nproblematic market structures. As such, there does not appear to be a need for \nthe  approximation  of  divergent  national  laws  via  the  NCT  pursuant  to \nArticle 114 TFEU, nor are there prospects of such divergence in the foreseeable \nfuture.  ","1385":"3.4  We understand that Greece and Romania already have legislation providing for \nan  investigation  instrument  similar  to  the  markets\u2019  regime  in  the  United \nKingdom.  We  are  however  not  aware  of  any  enforcement  practice  by  the \nrelevant authorities in Greece and Romania which may have impeded the proper \nfunctioning of the internal market. Similarly, the proposed amendments to the \ncompetition laws in some Member States such as Germany and France envisage \naddressing  perceived  competition  problems  in  the  platform  economy  by \nchanging  the  law  on  abuse  of  dominance  and  on  merger  control.  Again,  the \nsituation appears different compared to the situation that existed at the time of \nthe  introduction  of  the  EU  Damages  Directive  \u2013  which  also  relied  on \nArticle 114 TFEU  as  a  legal  basis  \u2013  when  there  was  a  perceived  need  to ","1386":"3.5  We  therefore  consider  that  the  legal  basis  for  the  proposed  NCT  should  be \nreconsidered.  During  the preparation of the EUMR there  was  also a debate25 \nabout the appropriate legal basis for this new legislative tool and in the end the \npredecessor of Article 352 TFEU was chosen. Article 352 TFEU may also form \nan  appropriate  legal  basis  for  the  proposed  NCT  as  envisaged  by  the \nCommission. Given the far-reaching nature of the NCT, having the full support \nof all the Council members and the involvement of the national parliaments as \nreflected in Article 352 (2) TFEU would lend appropriate authority and support \nto  any  new  instrument  conferring  such  far-reaching  new  powers  on  the \nCommission.  The  German  Monopolies  Commission  recently  opined  that  the \nappropriate legal basis for any ex ante platform regulation would be Article 352 \nTFEU  in  conjunction  with  Article  103  TFEU,  as  such  a  platform  regulation \nwould supplement the existing platform-related regulatory framework that the \nEU has already adopted.26 ","1387":"The IIA suggests that there could be a material overlap in the scope of the NCT \nand Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, if the Commission considers that issues cannot \nbe addressed by existing tools \u2018in the most effective manner\u2019.27 Further, the IIA \nnotes  that  the  NCT  will  have  a  role  in  \u2018allowing  for  timely  and  effective \nintervention against structural competition problems across markets\u2019 (emphasis \nadded).28 This highlights the importance of defining a properly scoped role for \nany NCT. If the Commission could intervene using the NCT in any instances \nwhere it perceives that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU could be applicable but may \nnot  address  the  Commission\u2019s  concerns  \u2018in  the  most  effective  manner\u2019,  this \ncould effectively render Articles 101 and 102 TFEU redundant.  ","1388":"Further,  if  the  Commission  is  proposing  that  it  may  use  the  NCT  in  many \ninstances where it will enable the Commission to address perceived structural \nrisks and problems in a timelier manner than under the current rules, this would \namount to a radical expansion of the Commission\u2019s powers. If the Commission \nneed only prove that a perceived competition problem will be dealt with more \nquickly through the NCT than under the current regime, the legal safeguards \ninherent in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU may be freely circumvented in the name \nof speed, disregarding the necessary due process. ","1389":"In this context, it should also be borne in mind that a wide overlap between the \nscope  of  the  NCT  and  established  enforcement  rules  would  lead  to  legal \nuncertainty and unintended consequences for competition in the EEA. It will be \nespecially important in that regard to ensure that the NCT could not be used in \nsuch  a  way  as  might  circumvent  the  evidentiary  standards  and  procedural \nsafeguards  applicable  in  relation  to  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU  or  the \njurisprudence of the CJEU. ","1390":"It would also be undesirable to be in a situation where the legal instrument used \nby the European Commission became a moving target (or rather a moving tool). \nIf one were to think of an investigation in a complex market which is initiated \nunder  Article  101  TFEU,  the  NCT  should  then  not  be  used  as  a  fall  back  to \nresolve  the  case  if  a  violation  of  Article  101  cannot  be  established  on  the \nevidence by the European Commission. This applies even more so under Article \n102 TFEU, where the outcome of an investigation by the Commission is even \nmore dependent on a proper assessment of the factual and economic evidence \nagainst the appropriate legal standard. Any inability to identify and prove to the \nrequired legal standard a theory of harm in an investigation based on Article 102 \nTFEU  should  not  encourage  the  Commission  to  recycle  the  issues  in  the \ninvestigation under the NCT with a view to imposing remedies or \u2018extracting\u2019 \nsome commitments on the basis of a factual and economic record which would \nnot have justified intervention under existing competition law. ","1391":"Similarly,  whilst  the  IIA  asserts  that  the  NCT  is  complementary  to  the \nCommission\u2019s  \u2018ex  ante  regulatory  instrument  of  very  large  online  platforms \nacting as gatekeepers\u2019 (Ex Ante Gatekeeper Regulation) which forms part of \nthe  Digital  Services  Act  package,29  the  two  legislative  initiatives  seem  to \nsignificantly  overlap.  In  determining  its  approach  to  tackling  any  perceived \nissues in digital markets, the Commission should ensure that this overlap is not \nmanifested \nthrough  over-legislation  and\/or  conflicting  provisions.  The \nrelationship between the NCT and the Ex Ante Gatekeeper Regulation would ","1392":"Another issue is that under the proposed Digital Services Act, the approach and \nstrategy taken by the European Union towards gatekeeper companies would be \nbifurcated  between  the  ex  ante  legislation  proposed  by  DG  CNECT  and  the \nintervention chosen by DG COMP. Indeed, DG CNECT proposes to change and \nexpand the existing internal market P2B Regulation (EU) 2019\/1150. Once this \nhas been achieved, digital companies will face two sources of intervention: (i) \nlegislation  and  the  updated  Regulation  2019\/1150;  and  (ii)  additional \ndiscretionary intervention under the powers of DG COMP which may deviate \nfrom or complement the tools provided for by the legislator in the new Ex Ante \nGatekeeper Regulation. This would hardly seem a desirable result from a legal \ncertainty standpoint. ","1393":"The inadequacy of overlapping legislative regimes is evidenced in the area of \ntelecoms  regulation,  which  is  regulated  by  a  mixture  of  parallel  enforcement \ntools \u2013 namely ex ante telecoms regulation law and ex post competition law. In \nthis  field,  the  Union  Courts  developed  an  untidy  solution  in  the  Deutsche \nTelekom set of cases, whereby the CJEU broadly concluded that \u2018[\u2026] it is only \nif anti-competitive conduct is required of undertakings by national legislation, \nor if the latter creates a legal framework which itself eliminates any possibility \nof competitive activity on their party, that Articles [101 and 102 TFEU] do not \napply. [\u2026] Articles [101 and 102 TFEU] may apply, however, if it is found that \nthe national legislation leaves open the possibility of competition which may be \nprevented, restricted or distorted by autonomous conduct of undertakings.\u201930 ","1394":"The  CJEU  has  upheld  the  decision  previously  handed  down  by  the  General \nCourt  in  case  T-271\/03,  Deutsche  Telekom  v  Commission,  which  stated  that \nDeutsche Telekom\u2019s liability for margin squeeze under Article 102 TFEU holds \neven if national law \u2018encourages or makes it easier for undertakings to engage \nin autonomous anti-competitive conduct\u201931 and even if the incumbent\u2019s prices \nhad first to be approved by the national regulatory authority.32 Even where the \nnational  regulatory  authority  had  approved  the  access  tariff  under  the \ntelecommunications  regime,  Deutsche  Telekom  was  not  shielded  from  a \ndecision that this tariff was still considered to be an unlawful margin squeeze \nunder Article 102 TFEU.33  ","1395":"4.11  Besides,  to  provide  an  example  from  the  analogue  business  world,  the  NCT \ncould  enable the Commission to take  a different  approach towards  enforcing \nparallel  trade  restrictions.  We  submit  that  it  would  be  inappropriate  if  the \nCommission  sought,  for  example,  to  apply  the  NCT  to  pharmaceutical \nwholesalers  whose  arrangements  reflect  existing  case  law  relating  to  parallel \nimports and the grey market. Changing accepted arrangements that have been \nrecognised as valid under the law by the Union Courts in this area would in our \nview not be an appropriate object for an intervention under the NCT. ","1396":"4.12  The two proposed regimes subject to the Commission\u2019s current considerations \nin  the  modernisation  of  EU  competition  law  (the  Ex  Ante  Gatekeeper \nRegulation and the NCT) are EU secondary law instruments and are, as such, \ndifferentiated from the relationship between EU primary and secondary law that \narose  in  the  Deutsche  Telekom  case.  Given  both  regimes  constitute  EU \nsecondary law, based on the application of the hierarchy of norms, a decision \nunder one regime has equivalent status to a decision under the other. However, \nit  would  be  worthwhile  for  the  Commission  to  establish  a  safe  harbour \nspecifically delineating this point, whereby an assessment and\/or finding by it \nunder  one  regime  would  preclude  the  Commission  from  further  assessment \nunder  the  other  regime.  Such  a  safe  harbour  would  provide  clarity  and  legal \ncertainty for undertakings.  ","1397":"The IIA does not meaningfully address the critical issue of the relevant legal \ntest, limiting itself to noting that \u2018similar to already existing competition tools \nof this kind, [the NCT] would be based on a test allowing the Commission to \nintervene  when  a  structural  risk  for  competition  or  a  structural  lack  of \ncompetition prevents the internal market from functioning properly.\u201934  ","1398":"Clarity on the applicable legal test for intervention is essential to safeguard the \nrule of law and ensure that companies enjoy the requisite legal certainty already \nprovided by Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.35 A clear definition of the notions of \na \u2018structural risk for competition\u2019 and a \u2018structural lack of competition\u2019 and the \nrequisite  standard  of  proof  in  establishing  the  existence  of  \u2018structural \ncompetition problems\u2019 is necessary. Additionally, the Commission would need \nto consider and issue clear guidelines detailing how it would identify \u2018structural \ncompetition  problems\u2019,  including  the  prevailing  characteristics  in  such \npurportedly  problematic  markets  and  how  it  would  benchmark  against \ncompetitive  markets.  Any  effective  public  consultation  on  the  NCT  must \naddress these core points in detail and we look forward to commenting on these ","1399":"The  NCT  could  empower  the  Commission  to  pursue  its  industrial  policy \nobjectives  by  changing  the  structure  of  certain  markets  or  by  requiring  law-\nabiding companies to modify their competitive behaviour on the market. Given \nthat  the  NCT  - as currently proposed  - does not  focus  primarily  on unlawful \nbehaviour, the NCT may empower the Commission to reshape an industry in \nthe  same  way  as  would  normally  be  achieved  by  internal  market  legislation \nadopted  through  the  legislative  process.  This  has  occurred  in  many \nconventional, notably utility, industries such as energy, telecommunications and \nrail. The NCT could provide the Commission, and in particular DG COMP, with \na  shortcut  to  intervene  in  a  market  in  a  manner  which  historically  in  the \nEuropean Union has been the reserved domain of legislation emanating from \nthe  Council  and  the  European  Parliament.  This  could  increase  the  perceived \ndemocratic deficit in the enforcement of European competition law seen in the \nState aid field and in cases where, as a result of enforcing Articles 101 and\/or \n102 TFEU, the Commission accepts far-reaching remedies from the companies \ninvolved under Article 9 of Regulation 1\/2003. ","1400":"Of course, the NCT itself would be adopted by the Council and the European \nParliament. Once adopted, however, it is entirely for the Commission to target \nspecific  companies  or  sectors  and  to  select  the  remedies  which  it  considers \nappropriate. In this there seems to be a tension between the normal prerequisites \nof  a  parliamentary  and  democratic  legislative  process  and  the  extraordinary \npowers the European Commission would acquire under the NCT. ","1401":"The NCT must equally ensure that there is a clearly defined evidential bar for \nthe imposition of behavioural or structural remedies and adopt an effects-based \napproach.  This  would  help  ensure  that  any  remedies  imposed  are  necessary, \nproportionate,  properly  designed  and  capable  of  addressing  any  perceived \nissues.  Again,  these  core  issues  are  not  addressed  fully  in  the  current \nconsultation  and  we  look  forward  to  considering  them  further  in  any  future \nconsultation which sets out a fuller proposal in this respect. ","1402":"The IIA states that the Commission\u2019s intervention through the NCT will have \nlimited  economic  impact  on  the  undertakings  concerned,  noting  that  \u2018the \nCommission  would  not  make  any  finding  of  an  infringement  of  the  EU \ncompetition  rules,  nor  impose  fines  and  thus  not  generate  rights  to  launch \ndamage claims\u2019.36 This is a surprising and counter-intuitive statement in light \nof the wide-ranging nature of the proposed powers which would be conferred \non  the  Commission.  The  economic  impact  of  behavioural  and\/or  structural \nremedies can be vast and indeed has the potential to be much greater than the \nimpact of a monetary fine, resulting in radical changes to undertakings\u2019 business \nmodels and\/or the restructuring of entire industries. Indeed, the NCT proposal ","1403":"Additionally, the IIA states that \u2018the proportionality of the costs incurred would \nbe  ensured  by  the  fact  that  such  remedies  have  to  be  limited  to  ensuring  the \nproper  functioning  of  the  market  under  scrutiny.  Consumer  benefits  deriving \nfrom  the  timely  intervention  under  all  policy  options  should  outweigh  those \ncosts.\u201937  In  this  regard,  robust  effects-based  economic  analysis  is  required, \nbalancing the potential anticompetitive effects caused by the \u2018structural risks \nfor competition\u2019 and\/or \u2018structural lack of competition\u2019 identified in the market \nin question, with the consumer benefits generated. This is particularly the case \ngiven  the  importance  placed  by  the  CJEU  on  the  robustness  of  the \nCommission\u2019s effects analysis in the Intel38 and Hutchison39 judgments. ","1404":"The IIA does not provide any details as to the procedural aspects and decision-\nmaking  process  that  the  Commission  will  follow  to  determine  whether \nintervention is warranted and how appropriate remedies will be designed. It is \nimperative  that  the  Commission  ensures  its  process  provides  for  appropriate \nchecks and balances to minimise the burden imposed on the companies involved \nand safeguard their rights of defence, good administration and of appeal.

In this regard, we note that other regimes which have \nmarket investigation procedures, e.g. the UK CMA, are bound by safeguards \ndesigned to ensure procedural fairness and independence of decision-making. \nThe need for separation between the decision-makers who decide to commence \na market investigation and those who reach the final conclusions at the end of a \nmarket investigation has been acknowledged in the UK to be important in order \nto safeguard the independence and robustness of market investigations.40 ","1406":"In particular, careful thought will be required to address issues such as: (i) the \ntransparency of the process; (ii) that parties are given access to decision-makers \nand the evidence collected by the Commission; (iii) that parties receive a fair \nhearing on the evidence of the case; and (iv) that parties are afforded sufficient \ntime  to  respond  to  requests  for  information  and\/or  intermediate  steps  in  the \ninvestigation (e.g. interim reports, statements of objections, etc.).

Given  the  potentially  far-reaching  implications  of  the \nCommission\u2019s  NCT  proposals,  investigated  parties\u2019  procedural  rights  and \nentitlement  to  judicial  protection  cannot  be  watered  down.  As  noted  by  the \nPresident of the General Court Marc van der Woude: \u2018[\u2026] where the contested \nconduct of the public authorities is repressive in nature, it is hard to conceive, \nat least in free democratic societies, that citizens and firms can be condemned \non the basis of estimates, approximations or guesses, even if they are informed \nones.  Uncertainty  must  then  be  balanced  against  the  requirements  of  the \npresumption of innocence.\u201941 The Commission should therefore ensure that any \nmoves towards remedy-based outcomes does not conflict with the fundamental \nlegal protections afforded by the EU legal order.42  ","1408":"The introduction of the NCT as currently proposed by the Commission is bound \nto have far-reaching implications and is likely to result in a paradigm shift in \nEU  competition  law  enforcement.

Should  the  Commission \ndecide  to  move  ahead  with  the  introduction  of  the  NCT,  it  is  of  paramount \nimportance that clarity is provided on the applicable legal test for intervention, \nthe threshold for the imposition of remedies and the procedural safeguards for \nthe companies involved, to safeguard the rule of law and ensure that companies \nenjoy  the  requisite  legal  certainty  already  provided  by  Articles  101  and \n102 TFEU.

There appears to be a widespread strategy to acquire customers and collect personal data in one area and then use the insight gained from that data and the company\u2019s customer access and technological infrastructure to expand into additional fields. Many large digital platforms have access to a large trove of data on customer behaviour that competitors in other sectors often lack. This advantage can be leveraged for access into other markets. Significant financial power and advantages regarding proprietary technology (for instance in artificial intelligence) can be contributing factors.See our reply to Question 8.5 above. Such leveraging can lead to reduced competition if a dominant firm extends its dominance to other sectors. However, the effects on competition of a market entry have to be analysed on a case by case basis, as market entry by a new competitor will often lead to increased competition in the target market.The Commission should be able to intervene, but only in cases where significant structural competition problems are to be expected. Grounds for intervention could be if an extension of market power to a related market is very likely to result in the monopolisation of that market.Articles 101 and 102 would not be effective in a situation where an extension of market power to a related market is very likely to result in the monopolisation of that market, since this does not necessary constitute an abuse within the meaning of Art. 102.","1411":"There do not appear to be any real-life cases in which the lack of such powers of intervention for the Commission would have led to under-enforcement.We realize that there is, at least in theory, a gap in Art 101 and 102 insofar as conduct by non-dominant players seeking to monopolize a market may not fall either under Art. 101 (which does not cover unilateral conduct) nor Art. 102 (which does not cover conduct by non-dominant undertakings). Nonetheless, we do not see a need for expanded Commission enforcement powers in this regard - see answer to question 11.1. above.","1412":"The instruments available in existing competition law to sanction abuse of (collective) dominant position are sufficient. Interventions in the functioning of markets should remain the exception and not the rule and should be restricted to extreme cases where such intervention is well founded, e.g. due to considerable consumer harm in important areas. Oligopolies are generally less competitive than markets with many participants, but that does not mean that state intervention \/ regulation is warranted.","1413":"An early intervention in such markets would have more drawbacks than advantages: there is a significant forecasting risk, so that intervention might do more harm than good. The instruments of \u201cclassic\u201d competition law appear to be sufficient.See our reply to Question 17.1. Stronger use of the existing power to impose interim measures might already be sufficient.Please refer to our reply to Question 18.2.\nMany digital platforms act as gatekeepers of some kind between the customer and the producer.Gatekeeper scenarios also occur in non-digital sectors \/ markets. For example, credit rating agencies (CRAs) have substantial market power as data providers \u2013 as such they act as gatekeepers because their ratings are essential inputs for the insurance industry, among others. This is taken into account in the CRA Regulation and ESMA\u2019s supervision of CRAs.\nBut the likelihood of gatekeeper scenarios occurring and the power of such gatekeepers is greatly enhanced by the features of some digital markets, especially a higher likelihood of monopolization  \/ concentration of market power.  \nA high number of customers \/ users and ease of switching is important for the degree of market power of a gatekeeper, but the most important factor in our view is the \u201clock-in\u201d-effect from the perspective of business operators.An important negative aspect of gatekeepers can be that business operators are no longer able (or to a significantly reduced extent) to reach or at least directly interact with their customers. Gatekeepers are able to use this direct contact to their advantage, also vis-\u00e0-vis the business operator.In our view, a gatekeeper function only leads to competitive concerns if further criteria are met, such as e.g. dominance, a dependency by business operators on the gatekeeper and\/or the gatekeeper\u2019s abuse of its position. Therefore, a mandate for the Commission to intervene has to be narrowly defined to avoid encompassing situations with no substantial competitive concern. Therefore, in our view, the Commission should only be able to intervene if the gatekeeper is also dominant.As mentioned above: Generally, Art. 101 and 102 should be suitable and sufficient, but there might be cases in which additional instruments could be required. Dominance of the gatekeeper should be a requirement but not necessarily an abuse within the meaning of Art. 102.As mentioned above, gatekeeper scenarios also occur in non-digital sectors \/ markets. But the likelihood of gatekeeper scenarios occurring and the power of such gatekeepers is greatly enhanced by the features of digital markets, such as a higher likelihood of monopolization  \/ concentration of market power.","1414":"Art 101 is not meant to address structural competition problems. Its purpose is to address anti-competitive behaviour.

Its purpose is to address anti-competitive behaviour. Whether or not there exist structural competition problems which need to be addressed  is a separate question.We are not currently aware of any concrete market situations which would require an intervention.Experience has shown that competition enforcement has struggled to some extent to keep up with the novel features of digital markets. However, the Commission and other competition authorities already possess far-ranging enforcement powers. Therefore, any new \u201ccompetition tool\u201d should be restricted to severe cases in which there has been market failure and severe harm to consumer welfare.As mentioned above, a new competition tool should be confined to extreme cases. This is even more true in cases where a prognosis is required. Under these circumstances, a preventive tool does not appear necessary.","1415":"It makes sense in our view to apply novel approaches and tools to the novel challenges posed by some platform markets. The tools proposed by the Commission are far-reaching and exceptional. If applied to \u201cclassic\u201d sectors and markets, this would lead to the question why the tools of competition law at the disposal are suddenly not sufficient any more.Competition law enforcement has generally worked well in \u201ctraditional\u201d markets. Even though such markets may also face structural issues, there is no need for further enforcement instruments there. Some platform markets on the other hand have novel features which may require such a type of intervention.We consider that powers to make recommendations should be part of the \u201ctoolbox\u201d for a new competition tool. Imposing remedies however should only be \u201cultima ratio\u201d and be restricted to severe cases in which there has been  market failure and severe harm to consumer welfare.We do not consider structural remedies as appropriate, especially if they would potentially be used in the absence of an infringement of competition law. Divestitures can already be ordered as a part of merger control proceedings and access can in some cases be granted as a remedy in abuse of dominance cases (essential facilities). ","1416":"\nAs mentioned in our reply to Question 31.1., structural remedies and especially divestitures constitute far-reaching instruments which constitute a deep interference with the rights of the undertakings concerned. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence that divestitures are an appropriate means to reach the goal of improving market structure. ?Any enforcement agency needs adequate powers to uncover the relevant information on which to base enforcement action.We doubt whether a power to carry out inspections at companies can be considered proportionate in an area where no wrongdoing of companies is suspected.Binding legal deadlines have proven useful in preventing cases from being drawn out, as the comparison between merger control and cartel proceedings shows.Experience especially in cases on digital markets has shown that interim measures are an important tool given that the fast pace of changes in these markets can otherwise lead to irreparable harm.We consider voluntary commitments as a flexible instrument to address structural competition problems if appropriate safeguards regarding due process are in place.Being given an opportunity to comment on the findings and charges is a fundamental part of the rights of defense in any proceedings. The fact that no fines will be set does not change that, as remedies can also place a significant burden on the companies concerned.The opportunity to comment on the appropriateness and  proportionality of the envisaged remedies is also a necessary part of the rights of defense.The new competition tool can only be in line with the established principles of European law and fundamental rights of defendants if adequate procedural standards are put in place, including but not limited to judicial review.In our view there is a need for an additional instrument addressing competitive concerns arising from the gatekeeper power of certain online platforms. Such an instrument should preferably be a new competition tool and not a separate set of new regulations.","1417":"Freelance journalism and consultancy - the latter especially on authors' rightsFreelance journalism and consultancyFreelance journalism and consultancyI use Twitter as an alerting service and will soon be forced to use LinkedIn and maybe Instagram... and of course Google and Facebook make use of my journalism without authorisation.I am answering this survey primarily to concur that a new competition tool is required, as a necessary condition for the effectiveness of a Digital Services Act, on which I have responded in detail.\"The point, Horsefry, is not to offer the best service.

Furthermore, the Danish Chamber of Commerce \nfully agrees with the Commission\u2019s statement that ensuring such fair, undistorted and contestabil-\nity markets require a holistic approach, and that a vigorous enforcement of the existing competi-\ntion rules is a very import part of this approach.  ","1428":"The Danish Chamber of Commerce is however not convinced that a holistic approach requires the \nintroduction of two new initiatives, e.g. ex-ante regulation of digital platforms and a new competi-\ntion tool. Additionally, we are very critical of the four policy options reflected in both the Commis-\nsions Initial Impact Assessment (\u201cIIA\u201d) and this public consultation on a New Competition Tool \n(\u201cConsultation\u201d), as they are very extensive and neither sufficiently described nor justified.

","1430":"While the Commission does make a clear statement of respecting the fundamental rights of Euro-\npean companies, specifically mentioning the companies right to defence and the right to judicial \nreview, which we consider very positive, the Commission fails to address the issue that with the \nproposed NCT, European companies will be left in a situation where they will not know what rules \napply, or what to stay away from in order to avoid being subject to NCT remedies. ","1431":"Companies spend a lot of time and resources developing their business strategy and marketing \nplans and coming up with innovative new ideas, with the hope and aim, of creating a successful \nbusiness. We fear that the proposed NCT whereby European companies, which do not violate or \nintent to violate the existing competition rules, will lead to a situation where European companies \nmay not have the same drive to further develop their businesses, as the successful development of \na company in a given market, may lead to the Commissions finding of either a structural risk for \nor structural lack of competition in the specific  market. As such, we fear that the proposed NCT \nmay result in a situation where European companies fall victim to their own success. ","1432":"Simply mentioning monopolization strategies by non-dominant companies with market power as \nan example of a structural competition problem that the Commission cannot address using the \nexisting competition rules, and parallel leveraging strategies by dominant companies into multi-\nple adjacent markets as an example of problems which cannot be addressed in the most effective \nmanner, is in our opinion not sufficient to describe the need or justification for the proposed NCT. \nWe therefore request the Commission to elaborate on these issues in the upcoming Impact As-\nsessment (\u201cIA\u201d).  ","1433":"It is the position of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, that Article 101 TFEU and Article 102 \nTFEU already provide a solid foundation for European competition law and are sufficiently flexi-\nble to address the changing markets.

This being even more \nthe case considering these measures may be imposed on private companies, which has neither vi-\nolated current competition rules nor may be considered an \u201cessential facility\u201d.

There must be a razor-sharp definition of which type of behav-\niour the Commission will be able to intervene against.

Furthermore, we \nalso encourage the Commission to investigate whether the structural competition problems can \nbe addressed by adjusting existing EU-rules, rather than introducing a new competition tool.  ","1441":"Furthermore, any NCT must pay special notice to avoid being used, interpreted or constructed in \nsuch a way, that it will de facto protect certain types of industries, sectors, technologies or busi-\nness-models at the expense of others.

","1445":"As a minimum, the Commissions investigative process and showing of market failure must fulfil \nthe requirements necessary for imposing sanctions and fines subject to existing competition rules. \nConsequently, the Danish Chamber of Commerce share the Commissions position, as it is stated \nin the Commissions press released, that a rigorous market investigation must be carried out, be-\nfore any NCT remedies may be applicable, but would like the Commission to elaborate on this in \nthe upcoming IA. ","1446":"The possibility of using the invasive investigative tools applicable to ordinary competition cases, \nsuch as possible cases of collusion or misuse of dominance must not be allowed against compa-\nnies which are not suspected of any wrongdoing. The possibility of conducting dawn raids should \nfor example not be possible, while the possibility of imposing fines may be considered, where the \ncompanies do not meet certain reasonable deadlines. At the same time, there must be specific \ndeadlines within which the Commission must decide whether to make use of the NCT-remedies, \nso that the companies are not left in uncertainty for years. ","1447":"The Danish Chamber of Commerce considers it a necessity for the introduction and application of \nthe proposed NCT, that the companies\u2019 right to defend themselves are respected both throughout \nthe investigative process, but also in connection with any subsequent measures. This includes -\nbut is not limited to, the right to be heard during the investigation, the right to be heard on the \nproposed measures, as well as the right to judicial review by the European Court.

On the other hand, it is widely recognised that continued investment and innovation, often enabled by the economies of scale and scope that such developments bring, are essential to ensure that the digital infrastructure of Europe can compete on the international stage. In this regard, we emphasize that competition policy should incentivise, not hinder, investment.","1449":"There is no such thing as a perfectly competitive market beyond the pages of economic textbooks. Many of the market features\/elements identified will be present in one market or another.

These behaviours are effectively dealt with through existing competition law tools.","1450":"There also is no one source or reason for structural competition problems. A feature may cause competition issues in one market but not in another. Moreover, the existence of market imperfections will not always warrant intervention. For example, concentrated markets attract scrutiny from regulators due to concerns about increasing market power. However, it is well established in European competition law that the mere fact that there are a few large players in a market does not automatically give rise to competition issues. Oligopolies for example, can \u2013 absent tacit collusion \u2013 be effectively competitive and pricing in oligopolistic markets can be entirely consistent with effective competition.

We strongly opposed this as, absent tacit collusion, oligopolies (including even duopolies) can be effectively competitive and pricing in oligopolistic markets can be entirely consistent with effective competition. In this context, we note that in the Netherlands, where the regulator raised concerns regarding the oligopolistic nature of the market, the higher court \u2013 applying the Airtours criteria \u2013 concluded that none of the cumulative criteria for the existence of tacit collusion were met.

Structural market features on their own cannot provide strong evidence on whether competition between oligopolists will be effective or not. Markets with just two operators competing with differentiated but substitutable products, different cost structures, and facing significant competitive constraints from external forces, such as online platforms and over the top (OTT) services, can produce significantly more competitive outcomes than markets with many operators but where products, cost structures and technologies are more homogeneous.","1457":"Economic models of competition in oligopolistic markets provide a full range of predictions based on different features in the market, from monopoly to perfect competition.

","1464":"Apart from being classified as an \u2018essential facility\u2019, the assessment of whether a company qualifies as a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 should be linked to market dominance (including the assessment of well-established economic factors that point to dominance such as significant network effects). Particularly in relation to high number of customers \u2013 we note that it is not the number of customers itself but rather if customer numbers give rise to network effects which may give rise to issues.The existence of a dominant gatekeeper does not in and of itself give rise to competition concerns. In our view, only if a gatekeeper is dominant and they abuse that dominance (e.g. by refusing access or imposing exploitative conditions) will there be competition concerns.Yes, in the circumstances above, which are already covered by Article 102. The framework developed under Article 102, particularly the criteria laid out in the Bronner case, allow the Commission to intervene effectively and creates legal certainty.

Article 101 is a an effective instrument to address the creation of structural competition issues through collusive behaviour. It allows for a clear legal framework and provides regulatory certainty.-Yes. Article 102 allows the Commission to effectively assess issues of abuse of market dominance in both vertical and horizontal settings. It allows for a clear legal framework and provides regulatory certainty.-We do not believe there is a need for a new competition tool to deal with structural competition problems or rather market imperfections. We believe that the regime established under Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty adequately tackle any competition issues which can arise in any market. ","1467":"Ex ante market intervention has been generally limited to market power issues in specific sectors, such as telecoms, energy, which have transitioned from state-owned monopolies to competitive markets. In other markets, market imperfections (such as information asymmetry) have been dealt with by addressing the imperfection directly i.e. through targeted legislation (e.g. transparency obligations). Any intervention should be in line with the principles of appropriateness and proportionality \u2013 balancing the benefits against the costs and impact on investment and innovation.See our response to question 24.1.1","1468":"We note that the points 1-3 are already within scope the Commission\u2019s regulatory toolkit (e.g. disinformation code of conduct, P2B regulation). Point 4 should only be imposed on the basis of full market investigation in line with existing procedures under Article 101 and 102 and following fair judicial procedures.Under Articles 101 and 102, the Commission is already able to impose appropriate and proportionate remedies where it finds competition issues. These remedies are established and well understood by both regulators and market players which contributes to legal certainty that is instrumental to incentives to invest and innovate which in turn best promote consumer welfare.","1469":"The application of behavioural remedies, under the supervision of a monitoring trustee, can be an effective way of addressing potential structural competition problems as well, particularly in rapidly evolving markets. For example, the joint application of commitments precluding contractual clauses preventing broadcasters from offering content via OTT services,  with a commitment to provide sufficient IP interconnection capacity \u2013 as a way of ensuring the former commitment is not circumvented through the potential congestions of interconnection links \u2013 shows that behavioural remedies can be appropriate to effectively address complex theories of harm.","1470":"As noted above, we consider Article 101 and 102 sufficient to deal with structural competition problems associated with dominance. In particular, we note that where an investigation has been undertaken, and a finding of abuse of dominance is made, there is possibility for parties to offer structural and\/or behavioural commitments to address the concerns.","1471":"We would strongly oppose any measure which would seek to unilaterally force structural remedies (such as divestment) on individual, private companies outside of the merger control context, in order to deal with market imperfections. To do so would be to take the role of market maker, which would introduce significant market uncertainty and would have significant negative effects on investment and innovation across the whole of the EU.As outlined above, we do not support the introduction of a new competition tool. The Commission already has sufficient powers under Articles 101 and 102 to address competition issues in European markets. However, if the tool is introduced, the powers should mirror those that exist under Articles 101 and 102. They should not go beyond these powers as this creates legal uncertainty and would have a chilling effect on investment and innovation. This chilling effect would ultimately have a negative impact on European consumers.","1472":"As outlined above, we do not support the introduction of a new competition tool.  However, if the tool is introduced, it should be subject to binding legal deadlines. They create legal certainty \u2013 and as such clear expectations for undertakings and regulators. It is legal certainty that is instrumental to incentives to invest and innovate which in turn best promote consumer welfare.As outlined above, we do not support the introduction of a new competition tool.  However, if the tool is introduced, any powers to introduce interim measures should be the same as those which currently exist under Articles 101 and 102 \u2013 any alternative approach would result in legal uncertainty. It is legal certainty that is instrumental to incentives to invest and innovate which in turn best promote consumer welfare.As outlined above, we do not support the introduction of a new competition tool.  However, if the tool is introduced, it should include the possibility to accept voluntary commitments. This encourages good market behaviour and lessens the need for extensive regulatory intervention. It allows for more efficient solutions to competition issues than drawn out investigations.As outlined above, we do not support the introduction of a new competition tool.  However, if the tool is introduced, market players that are potentially impacted should have the possibility to comment. Consultation with market players allows the Commission to get a better idea of how competition dynamics are playing out in person. The Commission must undertake and objective analysis and should be aware that other undertakings operating in the markets concerns, or suppliers and customers of those companies, have different interests and objectives. It is important that the Commission accounts for these objectives. This is best done during the investigatory stage, rather than immediately prior to the final decision.See our response to question 37.As outlined above, we do not support the introduction of a new competition tool.  However, if the tool is introduced, it should be subject to adequate procedural safeguards \u2013 like Commission decisions \u2013 including judicial review.

In our view, this could certainly be the case when players with market power adopt repeated strategies to extend their market position into related markets.\nToday, under the current competition law framework, the Commission can only intervene ex post with sanctions.\nBut, in order to prevent \u201cmonopolization\u201d of the secondary markets by companies with market power, a new tool should allow the Commission to intervene before the company acquires the same one also on the secondary market.\nEx post sanctions are not effective by themselves to this purpose, as they certainly can hit companies involved in a competition law breach and discourage them from new infringements, but they do not preserve the competitiveness of the market, which might be compromised without a timely intervention from the Commission.\nIdeally, the Commission should be able to preserve market competition, irrespective of charging companies with fines. Remedies, imposed ex ante, should effectively be used for this purpose, in order to correct the structural competition risks and problems. Such remedies could be behavioural or, in the most problematic cases, structural.As already said (see Q. 9.1), we believe that 101 and 102 TFEU are not suitable nor sufficiently effective to address those market situations, because it is impossible to enforce the proposed kind of intervention under these articles\u2019 framework.\nIn our opinion, especially digital markets, where market power is not reflected in its traditional dominance paradigm, make necessary the creation of a new tool, not based on ex post sanctions, but on remedies to protect the competitiveness of the markets.\nThe instrument should prevent companies with market power to leverage their status to expand to related market.We have experienced anticompetitive monopolization strategies in financial services, and especially in the mobile payments market.\nAnticompetitive monopolization strategies could refer to the primary market, in which the company has a high market power or to the related markets (e.g., secondary or adjacent markets).Referring to the answer 10.2, in the case of mobile payments app, we have witnessed anticompetitive monopolization strategies run by a major mobile operating system: in particular, it refuses to let third party apps (e.g., banks) access the NFC antenna, which is the key infrastructure to make contactless payments. Moreover, it only allows third party banks (the issuers) to access the NFC antenna through its own proprietary mobile payments app, which is installed by default and whose use is limited to the banks customers that have accepted its contractual conditions. Moreover banks, that want to enable their users to pay through the NFC antenna, must accept its condition and pay through its proprietary app.  \nThis behaviour has anticompetitive profiles, as the player leverages its gatekeeper role, thus reinforcing its position in the mobile payments market.As stated in answers 10.2 and 10.3, we have experienced anti-competitive monopolization strategies in digital markets and in the mobile payments market.Anticompetitive monopolization raises several competition concerns. \t\nIt is usually conducted by imposing unfair commercial clauses or limiting the access to key infrastructure or\/and data. Such strategies prevent the market to be competitive and lower its output. \nIn fact, anticompetitive strategies tend to monopolize markets, thus reducing consumer choice and stifling innovation. \nIn the long run, anticompetitive monopolization strategies, if successful, will always lead to higher prices for consumers.In our view, the Commission should forbid monopolization or attempt-to-monopolize strategies based on anticompetitive practices, that have a significant probability of success (driving out competitors and gaining monopoly status). The Commission should have the possibility to impose behavioural commitments to companies adopting anticompetitive monopolization strategies, thus addressing, for instance, issues related to access to key infrastructures and\/or key data.There is a need for the Commission to be able to intervene in a timely fashion, when the conditions to lead to a harm to competition show up. \nEx post sanctions according to articles 101 and 102 TFEU  are conceived to hit companies involved in a competition law breach and discourage them from new infringements, but they do not preserve the competitiveness of the market, which might be compromised without a timely intervention from the Commission.\nIdeally, the Commission should be able to preserve market competition, even irrespective of charging companies with fines. Remedies, imposed ex ante, should effectively be used for this purpose, in order to correct the structural competition risks and problems. Such remedies could be behavioural or, in the most problematic cases, structural.\nMoreover, especially regarding the abuse of dominance, the market power of certain digital market undertakings can be not reflected in the traditional dominance paradigm enforced under art. 102 TFEU, and some firms have more of an influence on the competitive process than their market shares would suggest.Cloud computing, especially for large companies, is a highly concentrated market with very few players.See answers below","1479":"Digital markets are, in many cases, tipping markets. In our experience, in case of social networks, operating systems and mobile messaging apps, the structure of the market determines very often that \u201cthe winner takes most\u201d, if not all of the market.Direct network effects represent certainly the most relevant feature of a tipping market: when a critical number of users is reached, new and existing users have minimal benefits in joining a different market. For instance, this could be the case of social network players.\t\nIndirect network effects determine that business side providers have no incentives to develop a product for a market without users, with a detrimental effect for end-users in terms of offer quality and variety. In fact, users benefit more as more content and service providers make their products available on the market. This could be the case of app developers that have no incentive to evolve apps on a new mobile operating system. At the same time, in a vicious circle, users have no interest in adopting a new mobile operating system if there are no apps in it.\nFinally, economies of scale are very relevant to a tipping market, because they make the raise of barriers to entry easier.\nOnline platforms, in particular, have very low marginal costs for new users.\nLast but definitely not least, very often tipping markets are characterized by the adoption of a zero-pricing strategy, which has revealed to be a further significant element to reduce the incentive to switch to another service provider.As far as we have experienced them, digital markets are characterized by extreme economies of scale, network effects (direct and indirect) and, often, zero pricing. All these characteristics can coincidentally be found in tipping markets.In tipping markets, once the firm has reached success, it is very unlikely to face any competitors. \nMoreover, the remaining competitors have less incentives to invest in R&D.In our opinion, it is crucial to establish a framework allowing the Commission to intervene early in tipping markets.\nHowever, given their characteristics and nature, it is often impossible to prevent a market to \u201ctip\u201d. \nThus, we are convinced there is a need for a twofold intervention by the European Commission:  it should first of all be in the condition to ensure an effective and fair competition before \u201ctipping\u201d. Then, once the market has \u201ctipped\u201d, the Commission should pay attention to the actions of dominant players of the digital markets, especially gatekeepers, ensuring fairness and effective competition are preserved within the tipped market.In our view, art. 102 TFEU can hardly be applied before a firm reaches the number of users necessary for the market to tip, as this would fall out of the scope of art. 102 in reason of a lack of dominant position.  \nMoreover, as already stated, ex post sanctions according to articles 101 and 102 TFEU are conceived to hit companies involved in a competition law breach and discourage them from new infringements, but they do not effectively preserve the competitiveness of the market, which might be compromised without a timely intervention from the Commission.\nIdeally, the Commission should be able to preserve market competition, even irrespective of charging companies with fines. Remedies, imposed ex ante, should effectively be used for this purpose, in order to correct the structural competition risks and problems. Such remedies could be behavioural or, in the most problematic cases, structural.See answer 18.2 (all the companies listed operate in digital markets).Gatekeeper scenarios also occur in non-digital sectors\/markets. Local and natural monopolies, such as network operators (e.g., telecommunications, energy) sometimes, have the nature of gatekeepers. In those cases, EU and national legal systems have already developed sector-specific rules to guarantee competition within those markets (e.g., the legal and functional unbundling in the energy sector).A high number of customers\/users might determine the nature of a gatekeeper by reinforcing this latter\u2019s market power through network effects. \nMoreover, when the high number of customers\/users does not multi-home, the gatekeeper becomes the only way to reach those customers.\nThen, the companies operating through the gatekeeper have to accept the condition of the business environment, in order to reach those users\/customers. \nLast, another relevant feature is the data owned by the gatekeeper which is necessary for the users to operate in a given market, as well as in order to comply with relevant rules (e.g., financial markets\u2019 data under MIFID).A gatekeeper can exclude some business operators from conducting business on the market or can apply unfair conditions (e.g., bundling, exclusive contracts, excessive and\/or unjustified technical requirements).\nA gatekeeper platform might choose to offer some services itself and prevent the business operator from competing with the gatekeeper.\nMarket power can result in higher mark-ups paid by the business operators, as well as in higher price paid by the consumer of a lower quality service.\nIt has been noted that online markets might lower the cost of exclusion. If a gatekeeper excludes a business operator from selling its services or products on the platform, users are likely to continue using the gatekeeper and switch to a different business service provider operating on the platform. It must be considered that switching costs between different platforms might be a lot higher than switching cost between two business operators, and users will blame the business operator for not being on the platform, rather than the platform itself.Indeed, it is of utmost importance for market competition and ultimately consumer protection, to ensure gatekeepers apply fair conditions and no discrimination to the business users, that want to operate through their platform.\t\nFor this purpose, the possibility to give access to key infrastructure and key data should be considered.\nAlso, the market experience is showing the need, in the case the platform competes at the same time with its business users, for a separation between the platform\u2019s gatekeeper activities and its activities as business user. In this regard, also vertical integration should be carefully observed, to prevent self-preferential treatment of the gatekeeper\u2019s products or services (e.g., advertisements) and ensure a proper use of customer data.\nIn the data markets, it is fundamental that the gatekeepers make the data available at reasonable prices and in standard form to all their clients. This is even more crucial in markets in which data are necessary to operate, because they are required by the regulatory framework (e.g., to conduct certain activities regulated by MIFID it is necessary to acquire data).Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are hardly applicable, especially in case of the establishment of a mandatory data sharing regime or a non-discriminatory regime for platforms without a dominant position.\nIndeed, the dominant position required to apply art. 102 TFEU is not appropriate to reflect the market power of online gatekeepers.\t\nGatekeepers might enjoy a very high market power without having a dominant position under art. 102 TFEU, because business users often need to deal with more than one gatekeeper to reach a large number of clients. In any case, monopolization strategies by a non-dominant gatekeeper (which aims at a monopolist position) cannot be tackled under art. 102 TFEU.See answers above.","1480":"As already noted, the market power of certain digital market undertakings cannot be reflected in the traditional dominance paradigm enforced under art. 102 TFEU. Indeed, as it is clear from the Commission\u2019s guidance, that some firms have more of an influence on the competitive process than their market shares would suggest.\nMoreover, art. 102 TFEU intervenes ex post, being thus not able to fix structural competition problems ex ante, which, in our view, is mostly needed.","1481":"In our opinion, for all the reasons expressed in section C, articles 101 and 102 TFEU are insufficient to tackle competition issues arising from digitalization.\t\nA further tool, able to tackle exploitation or exclusionary strategies conducted by digital companies with market power (but not necessarily dominant) in tipping markets and in markets that are related to digital markets where a digital operator has a gatekeeping role, is necessary.In our view, a new competition tool should be able to manage monopolization strategies, an anticompetitive market power extension of a gatekeeper to related markets (e.g., prohibiting self-preferencing clauses), Moreover, it should be able to effectively detect and manage the consolidation of the market power of the undertakings operating in tipping markets, as well as discriminatory access and technological barriers issues.","1482":"Digital markets, for the reasons and characteristics listed above, have proved to be the ones that present structural limits and risks to the competitive process and where structural competition problems are the most prevalent and\/or most likely to arise.\nTherefore, it would be reasonable for the new competition tool to cover only those digital markets.\nMoreover, experience has shown that we need a strong and robust sectoral pro-competitive regulation for the digital markets similar to those rules, that are applied to telecommunication, energy and banking (e.g., PSD2) at the national or EU level.For the same reasons that validate the application of the new competition tool to digital markets, it should be consistent to let it operate only on markets\/sectors affected by digitization. \nIn fact, digitized markets (the digital version of an analog market) must be considered digital markets (for all antitrust effects) as they have the same structural problems seen above. \t\nHowever, the new tool should only be applied to the digitized part of the market: the traditional businesses, which are digitizing some parts of their services, should fall under the scope of the new tool just for their digitized services.We believe it is crucial for the new competition tool to be as effective as possible and, thus, for this purpose we believe the new tool should focus on the power to impose remedies on companies to deal with identified and demonstrated structural competition problems. Moreover, these remedies should be enforceable by the Commission. On the other hand, and for the same reason (i.e.: for sake of effectiveness), we do not believe the tool should provide the possibility for the Commission to issue non-binding recommendation to companies.As stated above, it is our belief that the new tool should be as effective as possible. For this reason, the combination of the remedies listed above could reveal, in our opinion, to be effective in correcting some of the limits and risks of the digital markets.","1483":"The enforcement of the new competition tool by the Commission will require adequate and appropriate investigative powers, in order to be effective. In fact, without the possibility to assess the nature of the market and the market power of the companies active in that market, the new competition tool could be ineffective or even dangerous.","1484":"In order to be effective and supportive for the market, the tool has to ensure legal and procedural certainty, for the benefit of all the market players. So said, the Commission should for sure ensure that the investigations have a maximum time limit.The new competition tool should include the possibility to impose interim measures in order to pre-empt irreparable harm. However, the interim measures should be subjected to judicial review.It is fundamental to include the undertaking concerned into the process. We must bear in mind that the remedies are not sanctions. Allowing the undertakings concerned to participate give the Commission the possibility to come up with more creative, accurate solutions and commitments.During the proceedings, the companies operating in the markets concerned, or suppliers and customers of those companies should have the possibility to comment on the findings of the existence of a structural competition problem before the final decision. The participation of all the subject concerned should always be encouraged, as it allows the Commission to see different points of view of the issue.During the proceedings, companies operating in the markets concerned, or suppliers and customers of those companies should have the possibility to comment on the appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies. The participation of all the subject concerned should always be encouraged, as it allows the Commission to come up with more appropriate and if necessary innovative responses.It is clear that, as any other instrument under EU law, the new competition tool will be subject to all procedural safeguards as established by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Convention of Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.","1485":"Depending on the market(s) concerned and the individual conduct(s) under scrutiny, a number of the features listed above will be relevant (as opposed to 'somewhat important') in the assessment of whether the conduct of a given market operator is likely to raise significant competition concerns. This is fundamentally what Articles 101 and 102 TFEU mandate regulators to do, i.e. taking all the relevant legal context and economic circumstances before reaching the conclusion whether a particular conduct is capable of generating material consumer harm. ","1486":"Regarding digital markets, most academic\/economic work and expert reports that have been produced recently have opted for a descriptive or taxonomic approach of what is believed to be conferring significant market power. Put differently, it is fundamentally through recent enforcement against and observation of the GAFAM. The most common factors cited (see features J to N above) include massive\/exponential economies of scale and scope, and network effects (direct and indirect) and the massive use of non-personal and personal consumer data with the assistance of algorithms\/AI to observe, anticipate and predict the needs of consumers and improve product and service offerings and the extent to which the dominant platform is in a dual role.","1487":"Multi-homing will prima facie be considered as a factor that militates against a finding of significant market power. This being said, it will be important to consider the significance of multi-homing, i.e. not only how many users in a given market multi-home, but, more crucially, what is the competitive relationship\/pressure exerted by the service providers subject to multi-homing.","1488":"It is unclear whether zero price services is an important factor to assess market power in digital markets. This will largely depend on the business model chosen by the digital service provider and one may find multiple models used on one single relevant market (e.g. content streaming involve zero-priced services with advertising as well as subscribed services). Further, consumer bias\/inertia is a parameter that is more of a 'given', and has been observed in many other, non-digital, sectors (e.g. insurance, banking). As such, it is arguably beyond the control of the digital players, although it is admittedly the case that digital service providers will develop strategies to capture their attention through algorithms and other product\/app settings.","1489":"However, there is very limited empirical evidence and fairly limited understanding on the process through which a start-up becomes the largest market capitalization of the Nasdaq. One aspect that is often overlooked is that since digital companies incur large sunk costs and are sometimes loss making for several years, their financial success (and survival) is predominantly dependent on demonstrating exponential growth over a\nsustained period of time. The metrics vary from one business model to the other. For example, some players will engage in a race to grow their subscriber base as fast as possible; others will seek to grow the number of visitors and active users on their platforms as quickly as possible to secure future revenues (they may do\nso with significant discounts on the use of their service -- for example delivery costs -- or by offering the service for free). What matters is to build a \"community\" of users and\/or watchers, which can be leveraged or monetized. They will often describe consumers as \"members\" and will design their web-service to capture their attention and encourage their engagement for as long and as frequently as possible. In sum, in today's world, everyone competes for attention.The first behavioural scenario is commonplace in Article 102 TEU enforcement. It typically requires significant market power (super dominance) in order to be in a position to leverage such power into adjacent or related markets.","1490":"The gatekeeper scenario is one that the European Commission is currently looking at under Article 102 TFEU and it remains to be seen through ongoing enforcement cases whether such a scenario is in and of itself prone to generate so-called structural problems. The empirical evidence is scare in that regard and somewhat based on extreme and unique situations, which are very specific. It is far from clear why and in what way the existing competition rules are unfit to tackle such issues. After all, there is nothing really new when companies discriminate in their favor (which is not necessarily a competition problem) or engage in so-called 'self-preferencing'.","1491":"Finally market tipping is not necessarily a bad market outcome and the result of anti-competitive practices. There is a sequence and an evolution in the nature of competition: from competition \"for\" the market towards competition \"on\" the market(place). Once the market has 'tipped' in favor of the most successful digital solution, competition dynamics tend to move towards access and competition \"on\" the digital \"platform\". This usually will involve the latter moving away from the role of gateway to increasingly be incentivized to become a gatekeeper and rule-maker (for a variety of reasons, including platform integrity). But again, the single fact that one platform is rule-maker or gatekeeper does not in and by itself create a structural competition problem. In addition, the dual-role of the platform does not seem to be a feature that cannot be addressed efficiently with the existing competition rules.","1492":"The Commission should explain how it considers that a company 'repeated' strategy to grow through entry into related markets is a source of so-called 'structural competition problems' which cannot be suitably apprehended through Article 102 TFEU enforcement. After all, many companies and business models are focused on providing consumers with 'solutions' as opposed to single products or services. There is nothing wrong with a business model structured around creating an ecosystem or a set of complements to develop a unique consumer experience. The fact that companies use data is also not in and of itself a source of competition concern. In fact, one would expect all businesses to make increasing use of personal and non-personal data to expand in their core markets and beyond.Looking back at the Commission's enforcement over the past five years, it appears that Article 102 TFEU provides a sufficiently effective and well-targeted framework to deal with the significant market power of the large digital platforms. ","1493":"The Google Shopping case (self-preferencing and demoting), the ongoing investigation into Apple\/Spotify and the Amazon case in Germany provide support that the EU and Member States have the adequate antitrust toolbox to tackle potentially problematic conduct.Looking back at the Commission's enforcement over the past five years, it appears that Article 102 TFEU provides a sufficiently effective and well-targeted framework to deal with the significant market power of the large digital platforms. ","1494":"In fact, the issues that the Commission has or is currently investigating are quite unique and take place in rather extreme set of market circumstances, which cannot be used as support for legislative reform and extension of the existing competition law arsenal.There are myriad of cases where companies intelligently adapt their individual market behavior to the evolving pricing conditions and pricing conduct of their competitors. The well-established and consistent case-law of the European Court of Justice teaches that such conduct falls outside EU competition law.All the above factors are relevant, as opposed to 'somewhat important' but as stated above and further below, tacit collusion is and cannot become a source of competition intervention.","1495":"The Commission should not have power to intervene in such oligopolistic markets on the mere allegation that they are prone to tacit collusion. This would run against the Treaty principles underpinning Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, decades of European Courts case-law and open up the scale and magnitude of enforcement in new and unchartered territories, with potentially very negative outcomes in many industries.The use of price algorithms is widespread and it is yet to be determined whether such tools have a price stablization effect and enable the sorts of conduct that the Commission has in mind. Please refer to the conclusions of the joint study of the French Competition Authority and the Bundeskartellamt.Tacit coordination cannot become a source of EU competition law enforcement.

The horizontal application of the NCT across various sectors would also be in line \nwith  the  regulatory  principle  of  technological  neutrality  which  is  crucial  in  ensuring  the \napplicability of the proposed instruments to new competition issues in fast-changing markets. \nThe question of the sectoral scope should also be considered with respect to ex-ante regulation \nunder the Digital Services Act.

The \nInception Impact Assessments for both instruments envisage a mix of behavioural and structural \nremedies. However, they do not go any further in setting out how the choice of a specific set of \nremedies should be made.  ","1535":"In this respect, the Commission should first clarify the specific purpose of remedial action under \nboth  instruments:  Should remedies only  be used to  offset  the identified  adverse effect(s) on \ncompetition? Or should they go beyond and be used to approximate the functioning of a specific \nmarket with a theoretical standard of a well-functioning market, for instance, by facilitating a \ngreater  degree  of  competition  than  would  have  existed  even  in  the  absence  of  a  specific \nstructural or conduct feature that raises antitrust concerns?  ","1536":"Second,  any  future  policy  proposal  should  clarify  the  relationship  between  behavioural  or \nstructural remedies: are structural remedies only available as a last resort if the anticompetitive \nharm cannot be effectively addressed by behavioural remedies (akin to Regulation 1\/2003)?35 \nOr are structural and behavioural remedies substitutes between which the competition authority \ncan choose as it sees fit? This also raises the question of relevant procedural constraints, such \nas the principle of proportionality, a competition authority is subject to when imposing remedies \nunder both acts.  ","1537":"Third, the monitoring and duration of  remedies should  be clarified. This  question is  closely \nrelated to the institutional design of the New Competition Tool and Digital Services Act. The \nCommission would have to clarify whether the remedies are to be monitored by an independent \nregulator  (Commission;  or  new  authority)  or,  for  instance,  remedy  trustees.  Likewise,  the \ndefault duration of the remedies and the frequency of their periodic review would have to be \nclarified. The (cost of) monitoring and adequate duration of remedies may have an important \nimpact on the choice between behavioural and structural remedies.

Second, efficiencies can be factored in at the definitional stage of the adverse \neffect on competition. Here, the finding of considerable efficiencies or countervailing factors \nmay undermine or prevent the finding of an adverse effect on competition. In particular, under \nthe DSA, efficiency considerations could be encoded in the specific design of ex ante obligation \nand rules. Such optimally calibrated rules could take the form of a black-\/grey-listed practices \nakin to the black- and grey-listed clauses under the VBER.39 Third, the New Competition Tool \nand the Digital Services Act could also provide for an explicit \u2018efficiency defence\u2019 allowing \nfirms to proffer an objective justification to rebut the finding of adverse effects on competition \n(New Competition Tool) or the breach of ex-ante obligations\/regulations (Digital Services Act). \nFourth, efficiencies and other countervailing factors could also be accounted for at the remedies \nstage  by  requiring  the  showing  (and  periodic  review)  that  the  proposed  (and  implemented \nremedies) do not deprive firms of legitimate sources of efficiencies.

Absent  any  articulation  of  specific  theories  of  harm, \nthese  benefits  remain,  however,  rather  diffuse.  At  the  same  time,  both  Inception  Impact \nAssessments consider behavioural and structural remedies as the sole source of regulatory costs \nfor firms. They thereby obfuscate the costs arising from type I errors.

It concludes that the tool has major positives and would be a valuable \naddition to the Commission\u2019s toolkit, in digital markets and more widely. However, as was \nconcluded in the 2019 UK Unlocking Digital Competition report, the MI tool also has \nlimitations and should not be viewed as a full solution to digital platform issues. In \nparticular, although it has huge flexibility in designing and implementing remedies, the \nprocess of monitoring, enforcing and revisiting these remedies over time has some \nimportant limitations. ","1552":"In focusing on the UK situation, this article does not endeavour to consider the complexities \nof introducing this tool at EC level. Nevertheless, certain aspects of the UK system may well \nbe relevant to its effectiveness. The fact that the CMA has both competition and consumer \npowers is valuable, since many market studies effectively address issues that would \notherwise \u2018fall through the cracks\u2019 between these two areas of law. The UK\u2019s system of \nconcurrency between the CMA and sector regulators is also important, at least for the \nmonitoring and enforcement of MI remedies in these sectors.  ","1553":"The statutory requirements around governance within the UK process are also relevant, and \nspecifically the need for separation between the decision-makers who decide to commence \nan MI, following an initial market study, and those reach findings at the end of an MI. \nFinally, the international context for intervention may of course be different at EC level than \nfor the CMA as a UK-focused authority.  ","1554":"In the UK, MIs are used as a complementary instrument alongside other competition \npowers, and this would also be the case at EU level. So what advantages does this tool have \nin this context? What can it do that existing EC competition law cannot? The remarks below \nconsider some key benefits in relation to scope, remedies and procedure.  ","1555":"Most competition law provisions are primarily focused on preventing competition from \nbecoming worsened, for example through mergers, collusion or abuse of dominance. A \nvaluable contribution of MIs is that they can play a more proactive role in promoting \nincreased competition. So, for example, they can introduce market opening measures that \nare intended to shift the whole nature of competition. The Open Banking measures which \narose from the UK Retail Banking MI are a good example, in that they were designed to ","1556":"Standard competition law is primarily focused on the conduct of firms, albeit this conduct is \nconsidered within its market context and thus wider market characteristics can play a role. \nBy contrast, MIs are designed more broadly to tackle any and all \u2018features\u2019 of markets which \nare found to adversely affect competition. While such features can include firm conduct, \nthey can also comprise factors such as economies of scale and scope, network effects, \nregulatory and structural barriers, and consumer behavioural factors. Remedies are \nfrequently targeted at addressing these other factors, as opposed to restricting \nanticompetitive conduct by firms. ","1557":"On the supply side, for example, they can examine subtle complexities in the nature of \nstrategic interdependence between firms, including the potential for tacit coordination. \nIndeed, the ability to examine \u2018tight oligopolies\u2019 is a key benefit of the regime. The 2014 \nAggregates, Cement and Ready-mix Concrete MI is a good example. The Competition \nCommission (the CMA\u2019s precursor) identified a combination of structural and conduct \nfeatures that were leading to coordination and higher prices. These were addressed through \nclear structural measures (divestment and market transparency reduction), rather than via \nmore direct, but arguably harder to police, behavioural requirements on firms to cease \ncolluding. MIs can also consider the implications for firm incentives of factors such as \nvertical integration, principal-agent issues or regulatory barriers. ","1558":"On the demand side, meanwhile, MIs can consider firm conduct that might dampen or \ndistort competition through making consumer decision-making difficult. Examples might \ninclude failing to provide clear and comparable information, refusing to deal with price \ncomparison website services, including contractual terms that make switching costly or \nmaking the process of switching cumbersome. Firms can be required to make changes to \ntheir conduct in these areas. While such factors may seem to have more in common with \nconsumer law than competition law, they are not typically covered by consumer law and \ncan have very significant implications for competition, even in relatively non-concentrated \nmarkets.  ","1559":"MIs can also address markets can which have become \u2018stuck\u2019 in bad equilibria, which are \ngood for neither firms nor society, but where some form of intervention is required to make \nthe shift to a better equilibrium. For example, it may not be in the interest of any individual \nenergy company to make it easier for their own consumers to switch supplier, even if the \nwhole market would work more effectively and consumer trust would be increased if \nswitching was generally easier.   ","1560":"Even to the extent that firm conduct is relevant, the focus of MIs is firmly on anti-\ncompetitive effects. It is not relevant for MIs whether conduct it is deliberately anti-\ncompetitive or whether firms are otherwise culpable for the harm. Indeed, even if the \nconduct in question creates efficiency benefits for consumers over the short term, and thus \nmay well reflect a short run pro-consumer focus on the part of firms, it could still be found \nto create an adverse effect on competition if there is likely to be a consequent loss of \ncompetition that would harm consumers over the medium to long term. By contrast, while \nthe role of intent in abuse of dominance cases is somewhat ill-defined, it is typically \nconsidered hard to sanction a firm that can show it is acting in its own short-run interest, \nwith no strategic anti-competitive intent, or at least a finding of culpability.  ","1561":"The targeted market-specific nature of MI analysis and remedies, and the lack of any need \nto show culpability, means that only limited consideration is given to wider deterrence and \nprecedence. This could be seen as a negative, given the important role that wider \ndeterrence plays in competition law generally and in providing legal certainty for firms. \nHowever, it does provide for more freedom to carry out economic analysis without being \nunduly constrained by the policy approaches and precedent from past cases.  ","1562":"For example, while the MI process does involve a market definition exercise, this is not \ngiven the same weight as it is in abuse of dominance cases. The focus is quite properly on \nthe analysis of competitive constraints. (This should of course also be the case in \ncompetition law more widely but in practice is not).  ","1563":"It also means that MIs are better able than standard competition law to consider the wider \ncontext, and in particular the complex interplay between competition and other policy areas \nsuch as privacy, consumer policy and fairness, and environmental issues. The CMA is \nespecially alert to these links, given its dual role as a competition and consumer authority, \nand the UK system of concurrency with sector regulators.  ","1564":"This ability to look at a panoply of interrelated issues across a market, or markets7, without \nany need to demonstrate culpability, is likely to be especially useful in digital platform \nmarkets. As was highlighted in the 2019 Unlocking Digital Competition report: \u201cThe \nchallenges to effective competition in digital markets do not come about solely because of \nplatforms\u2019 anti-competitive behaviour and acquisition strategies.\u201d  ","1565":"In these markets, the issues frequently arise from a combination of complex interleaving of \nfirm conduct, consumer behaviour, economic characteristics, technological factors, and \nvarious aspects of regulation. Promoting competition in this sector will therefore not be \npurely about limiting anti-competitive conduct, important as that is. It will also require more \nproactive measures.  ","1566":"The Commission\u2019s Inception Impact Assessment for its proposed New Competition Tool \nhighlights the potential to use the tool in relation to (i) markets displaying systemic failures \ngoing beyond the conduct of a particular company with market power or (ii) oligopolistic \nmarket structures with an increased risk for tacit collusion. Both of these objectives fit well \nwith past experience of the MI regime. ","1567":"The Commission\u2019s Impact Assessment also emphasises the potential use of the tool to \nintervene early to prevent markets from tipping, an issue of particular relevance in markets \nthat exhibit strong network effects, such as digital platform markets. It is entirely true that \nsuch interventions may be difficult to make under standard competition law, given the \nabsence of existing single firm dominance. However, it should be admitted that the UK has \nlimited experience of using MIs to this particular end. ","1568":"The reduced role played by market definition may also be valuable in digital markets, given \nthe complexities involved in a formal market definition process in this context. These largely \narise from the wide spectrum of organisational types and relations we observe. We know \nthat digital players can compete despite some having closed ecosystems while others have \nopen; despite some acting only on one side of a market, while others are multi-sided; \ndespite some being integrated into interface activities, while others are stand-alone. These \nfactors are important to examine carefully when assessing competition, but it is unhelpful to \nunduly constrain this analysis by forcing it into a narrow market definition exercise. Indeed, \nit could be argued that a weakness of competition law \u2013 and especially abuse of dominance \nprovisions \u2013 is that the legal framework requires the boundaries of firms and markets to be \ndefined in unrealistically black-and-white terms. ","1569":"Traditionally, an important aspect of the UK MI regime was that it included powerful \ninformation gathering powers, which could be used to \u2018shine a light\u2019 into markets in order to \nunderstand the barriers to competition that may exist. Since 2014, however, the CMA now \nhas the same powers in respect of its market studies. Market studies can precede an MI, as \na form of first stage review, but they can also be stand-alone reviews. As such, they are \nsimilar to the European Commission\u2019s own Sector Inquiries, albeit the Commission has the \nadditional ability to carry out dawn raids, a power which is not available to the CMA for \neither market studies or MIs. Like EC Sector inquiries, UK market studies can also be useful \nfor generating recommendations for legislation, advocacy, or enforcement.  ","1570":"If an adverse effect on competition is identified, the CMA is required to achieve as \ncomprehensive a solution as is reasonable and practicable. The toolkit of potential MI \nremedies is extremely broad, so long as they are effective and proportionate to the \nidentified concerns.8 The main limitations are the requirement to target Orders at identified \nfirms, which limits the potential to  introduce non-firm-specific horizontal regulation9, and \n(to date at least) the need to respect EC Modernisation and EC maximum harmonisation \nprovisions.10   ","1571":"This breadth of opportunity could be viewed negatively, as allowing excessive scope for \nintervention. Indeed, the sorts of interventions imposed through MIs can be similar to those \nmore typically imposed in other jurisdictions though legislation, but without any process of \nparliamentary review.11 This reflects a wider UK focus on enabling competition-focused \ninterventions, free of political consideration, but is also partly why there are tight checks \nand balances within the MI process, as discussed further below. ","1572":"8 Remedies can be agreed with firms through undertakings or imposed on firms through Orders. While the \nprovisions that can be imposed through Orders are formally constrained by legislation, the wording is \nsufficiently broad to allow most options. (See Enterprise Act 2002, Schedule 8). There is no constraint on what \ncan be imposed through undertakings.  \n9 Although note that MIs can also lead to recommendations to Government to introduce such regulation. \n10 EC Modernisation provisions limit the ability of the CMA to impose remedies in relation to agreements \nwhich would be exempt from EC competition law, most relevantly vertical restraints which fall under the \nvertical restraints block exemption. EC maximum harmonisation provisions, such as within consumer \nprotection or financial services regulations, may limit the ability of the CMA to impose more intrusive \nremedies than already required by law in some areas. \n11 Some MIs have in fact been followed by domestic and\/or EU legislation that supersedes the original \nremedies, and the CMA has an ongoing programme of reviewing and sometimes revoking old Orders, partly \nfor this reason. See: https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/cma-cases?case_type%5B%5D=review-of-orders-and-undertakings. ","1573":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fHowever, the breadth of potential remedies also brings clear benefits. While standard \ncompetition law remedies tend to be narrow and backward-looking, MI remedies can be \nforward-looking and market-wide, with remedies frequently applying across the market, \nirrespective of individual firm market power. A package of remedies may be used to address \ndifferent aspects of market failure. Supply-side measures may be utilised to reduce market \npower directly or to limit the potential for its exploitation, for example through tacit \ncollusion or exclusionary behaviour. Demand side remedies are designed to enhance \nconsumer engagement and decision-making, through improved disclosure requirements \nand facilitating consumer search and switching, or to protect consumers against unfair \ntreatment.  ","1574":"MI remedies can potentially also extend beyond a specific example of an issue that has been \nanalysed, so long as this can be justified through the economic analysis. Again, this is \npotentially relevant to digital platforms. At the completion of the Google Shopping case, DG \nCompetition was only able to impose a remedy relating to Google Shopping. It could not \nextrapolate from its findings and impose rules relating to analogous behaviour by Google in \nother vertical search markets such as job search, hotel search or local search. It is true that \nfollow-on cases are easier to bring once an initial decision has been reached, but each case \nstill needs to be assessed and proven individually. By contrast, an MI in this area might \npotentially have led to Orders which restricted Google from engaging in this sort of \nbehaviour more generally, beyond the specific example of Google Shopping, so long as it \ncould be shown that the same conclusions were likely to apply. ","1575":"This ability to introduce small-scale ex ante regulation can be especially valuable in markets \nwhich require intervention in order to work more effectively, but which are not covered by \na sector regulator. It can also be a valuable complementary tool in regulated markets, \nwhere the issue in question is not within the scope of the regulation, or where the regulator \ndoes not otherwise have the requisite powers to address it.  ","1576":"Finally, while interventions are typically designed to enhance competition, they can also be \nused to protect consumers from the harm arising from limited competition. For example, \nthe CMA introduce a safeguard price cap for pre-payment energy customers following the \nMI into the energy market. These customers were found to be frequently vulnerable, \nrelatively unlikely to switch provider, and at risk of exploitation.  ","1577":"As is clear in the above table, the UK MI regime also allows for structural remedies to \nmarket problems. This power is much touted, but it is utilised rarely in practice. It can be \ndifficult to demonstrate that such an interventionist remedy is required, as the CMA found \nto its cost in 2016 when it was forced to abandon its attempts to require hospital \ndivestments, following an appeal and remittal in relation to its private healthcare MI. ","1578":"Divestment is arguably most likely to be required in situations where firms have effectively \nfound to be single-firm dominant (albeit that terminology is not used), such that it might \nhave been feasible to extract similar remedies under existing EC competition law. However, \nit can be applied where a lack of competition is harming consumers, even if there is no clear \nabuse. An example might be the divestiture of London and Scottish airports which resulted ","1579":"That said, structural remedies can potentially be imposed in a wider set of circumstances, \nfollowing an MI, if existing market structure if found to be contributing to an adverse effect \non competition. The 2014 report requiring structural remedies in the UK aggregates sector \nwas based on a careful economic analysis of the complex vertical oligopoly situation in the \nUK. It is not obvious that single firm dominance would have been found. ","1580":"However, it is important that the existence of MIs is not viewed as a rationale for weakening \n(or even not strengthening) the merger regime. While it is theoretically true that an MI \ncould be used to unwind an anticompetitive merger, this would be bad public policy given \nthe high costs involved in \u2018unscrambling\u2019 mergers post-integration. In a different but \nanalogous context, this is shown by the difficulties experienced in trying to address \nbreaches of state aid law in the UK banking sector through structural remedies. ","1581":"There are limitations to use the of MIs in a digital context, as will be discussed further \nbelow. As such, the 2019 Unlocking Digital Competition report argued for the introduction \nof pro-competitive digital platform regulation rather than relying purely on the MI tool. The \nalternative \u2013 addressing concerns through a series of MIs \u2013 would lead to a series of \nbehavioural remedies that would require ongoing monitoring, and thus effectively turn the \nCMA into a mini-regulator by default anyway, but with the risk that such regulation would \ntake a somewhat piecemeal and imperfect form.12  ","1582":"The breadth of potential remedy types, and the ability to develop a package of remedies, is \nlikely to be especially valuable, given the complex set of drivers for the issues arising in \nmany digital markets. For example, data portability provisions, such as those introduced \nthrough the CMA\u2019s Open Banking remedy, may well be valuable for opening a number of \ndigital platform markets, including social media. Other valuable supply-side remedies might \ninclude interoperability provisions, non-discrimination requirements, a ban on paying for \ndefault position, requirements to deal, or requirements to provide data access. ","1583":"The demand-side is also very important in digital markets. As such, there may also be \npotential for remedies that improve consumer decision-making. For example, in its recent \nmarket study into Online Platforms and Digital Advertising, the CMA identified a number of \npossible remedies designed to given consumers greater control over their own data, ","1584":"12 There are also funding implications. In the UK, sector regulators are typically funded by industry participants, \nso a specialist digital regulator would likely be funded by levies on designated firms. By contrast, the CMA is \nfunded by UK taxpayers, with no powers to levy firms to fund its work in monitoring and enforcing remedies.  ","1585":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fincluding requiring the major platforms funded by digital advertising to be more transparent \nwith consumers about the data they are providing and to ensure that the associated choice \narchitecture really acts to facilitate informed consumer choice.13 One could also envisage \nmore general remedies, applying to all platforms with very substantial market shares, to \nensure that they do not unfairly utilise the choice architecture on their platforms, or unfairly \ndesign their algorithms, to steer consumers towards additional services or towards their \nown products.   ","1586":"The independence and robustness of MIs is bolstered by the associated governance. There \nis a clear split of decision making between the decision to refer a market for investigation, \nwhich is taken by the CMA Board, and the final MI decision, which are made by a Group of \nindependent decision-makers, drawn from the CMA Panel. CMA Panel members are all \nhighly experienced, non-political, and bring a diversity of expertise and viewpoints. They are \nnot CMA staff. The Group members for each MI are named publicly.  ","1587":"MIs effectively constitute the second phase of a two-stage process. The first stage, which \ntakes the form of a 12-month market study, carries out initial market analysis and considers \nwhether a market investigation \u2018reference\u2019 is warranted.14 Prior to the creation of the CMA, \nthe two phases occurred in two separate bodies; the market study and referral decision \nwere taken by the Office of Fair Trading and the investigation was carried out by the \nCompetition Commission. To limit the risk of confirmation bias within the CMA, post-\nmerger, rules require that there is no overlap of people between the Board members who \ntake the reference decision and the Group members taking the final MI decision.  ","1588":"As well as limiting confirmation bias, this two-stage process is also valuable for avoiding the \nMI process becoming a depository for unpopular political issues that no one else wants to \ntackle. These will typically be considered through a market study instead. This affords the \nCMA the same investigatory powers as an MI, but none of the formal remedial powers.  ","1589":"The two-stage process can also be utilised to extract formal undertakings from parties at the \nend of a market study in lieu of a MI reference. For example, the UK telecoms regulator has \nutilised this process to extract undertaking from telecoms infrastructure provider, \nOpenreach. Like the European Commission\u2019s own Sector Inquiries, market studies can also \nlead to recommendations to Government or sector regulators, advocacy, guidance or \nenforcement action, without any MI reference being made. ","1590":"An important positive of MIs is that the overall procedure is very transparent. During the \nprocess, the CMA will publish: an initial issues statement; working papers and an annotated \nissues statement; provisional findings and possible remedies notice (if relevant); provisional \ndecision on remedies (if relevant); and a final report. Any interested party can comment on \nthe intermediate documents. While confidential information will be redacted, sufficient \ninformation will typically be made public to allow effective consideration of the issues. \nResponses from parties are typically also published. There are hearings with parties at key \nstages, attended by the full decision-making Group.  ","1591":"This level of transparency is substantially greater than that in standard competition law and \nallows for a robust and participative approach. Indeed, while market investigations clearly \nneed to be well-evidenced and robust and issues are hard-fought, the engagement between \nthe CMA and parties nevertheless tends to be more open, less adversarial and less legalistic \nin MIs than in standard competition law cases relating to abuse of dominance or anti-\ncompetitive agreements.  ","1592":"As well as transparency, this less adversarial approach may reflect the economic focus of the \nanalysis, the very limited role played by legal precedent, and also the fact that market \ninvestigations can end up anywhere \u2013 including a finding of no adverse effect on \ncompetition \u2013 so parties have much to gain from engaging openly with the process. \nRemedies can even turn out to be unexpectedly positive for firms. The early (1993) \nrequirement on British Gas to divest its distribution business is a case in point. The \ncombined valuation of the two separate companies quickly exceeded that of the original \nvertically integrated incumbent. Moreover, good remedies can make the market work \nbetter, and firms will understand this even they don\u2019t necessarily like it. ","1593":"MIs also seem to be less subject to appeal and standard competition law cases. This \ndifference of approach may partly reflect the different appeal standard in the UK; MI \nfindings can be appealed on a Judicial Review (JR) basis only, while Competition Act 1998 \ncases receive a Full Merits review. In the context of such a JR, the high levels of \ntransparency and other procedural safeguards could also play a role. Certainly, appellants \nhave rarely been successful in challenging MI decisions, and from the authority\u2019s successes, \nit is clear that the CMA has a wide margin of appreciation with its diagnosis of problems and \njudgement as to which remedies are effective and proportionate. ","1594":"Another relevant factor is that there are no fines, and thus no quantum of penalty to be \nchallenged on appeal. Perhaps less positively, an alternative explanation for the low number \nof appeals is that, with several companies involved, each one faces a free-rider problem in \nchoosing whether to appeal; the appeal costs fall to the individual firm while the benefits of \nany appeal success would typically go to all.  ","1595":"There are some positives from a tight timeline. It helps to engage minds; early intervention \ncan reduce extent of consumer detriment; and it can be especially important to intervene \nquickly if competition concerns are worsening over time, for example because a market is \nquickly \u2013 but avoidably \u2013 tipping towards monopoly. It has also proven to be possible to \ncomplete a reasonably robust analysis of the substantive market issues within this \ntimeframe, greatly aided by the initial market analysis that is carried out at the market study \nphase of the process which can take up to a year and occurs prior to reference.  ","1596":"What has proven harder is to carry out effective remedy design on such a tight timetable. In \nthe past, this issue was exacerbated by a policy approach which determined that remedies \nshould not be considered until adverse findings had been identified. While such an \napproach might appear reasonable, it is simply impracticable. Remedy design is complex, \nand it is easy to get it wrong. As such, potential remedies are now considered from the start \nof the process, and sometimes even (informally) before the formal MI launch.  ","1597":"While this is a positive change, the available time is still frequently insufficient for designing \ncomplex remedies or properly piloting remedies, for example through the use of \nrandomised controlled trials. That said, creative solutions may be available. For the \nconsumer engagement remedies arising in the recent energy and banking MIs, the final \nremedy design, testing and implementation was left to the relevant sector regulators, who \ncould take the required time to do this properly. The CMA imposed on the parties a \nrequirement to engage with such trials. Likewise, due to the complexity and likely time and \nresources involved in its Open Banking remedy, the CMA required that a new entity be set \nup and tasked with the detailed design and implementation of the remedy. ","1598":"A more serious problem with the MI regime is that remedies cannot be revisited once they \nhave been formally imposed, if they are found to be imperfectly designed or ineffective. \nThere is only a provision for parties to request that remedies be altered or removed if they \ncan demonstrate that there has been a \u2018material change in circumstances\u2019 since they were \nimposed.  ","1599":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn considering the impact of this inability to alter a remedy package, it is interesting to note \nthe parallel experience of market studies carried out by the UK Financial Conduct Authority. \nThese can also give rise to remedies, but because this is done through changes to regulatory \nrules, there is flexibility to trial remedies and revisit. In some cases, the FCA has completely \nabandoned specific remedy proposals, following testing, and the remedy package has been \n(or is being) substantially revised to make it more effective.  ","1600":"Such flexibility is arguably in the interest of both firms and consumers; no one gains from \ncostly, ineffective regulation. The CMA recently highlighted that there may be potential for \na change in its powers which would enable it, within a fixed period of time, to revisit its \nremedy package while continuing to rely on its substantive findings on competition.15  ","1601":"The inability to flex remedies may be especially problematic in dynamic markets which are \nsubject to significant change. In such markets, the identified concerns may be fairly \npersistent (although this is not a given), but the appropriate remedies may well require \nflexing as the markets and technologies change. This was one reason why the Unlocking \nDigital Competition report took the view that market investigations, while potentially useful, \nwere unlikely to provide a complete solution in digital platform markets. ","1602":"In other markets, the CMA has an experienced and expert remedy monitoring team to \nmanage this process. The ability to impose reporting requirements as part of a remedy can \nbe valuable for facilitating this process and maximising the impact of the CMA resources \ninvolved. In a number of instances, the CMA has also used a third-party implementation or \nmonitoring body, funded by the companies involved. For example, the Open Banking \nImplementation Entity was funded by the nine major UK banks and able to draw in technical \nexpertise on standard-setting and implementation of APIs.  ","1603":"However, the resources and expertise required to carry out quasi-regulatory remedies \nmonitoring in a complex environment should not be understated. In a digital context, with \nthe potential for market interventions relating to highly complex areas such as \ninteroperability, standard-setting and algorithmic design, the required monitoring could \nquickly start to look more like that carried out by the telecoms and financial regulators, \nrather than that typically done within the CMA\u2019s remedies team. This was another reason \nwhy the Unlocking Digital Competition report took the view that market investigations, \nwhile potentially useful, an ex ante regulator was also required. ","1604":" \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n\fA further limitation of the CMA\u2019s enforcement powers is that it has no direct ability to \nimpose sanctions for breach. It can only go to Court to obtain a court order, breach of which \ncould then be penalised. Even then the penalties are typically low. This is unlikely to provide \neffective enforcement mechanism for breaches, especially for large firms such as the major \ndigital platforms. The CMA has written to Government requesting that this situation be \nchanged.16  ","1605":"A final challenge arises where parties\u2019 assets are located outside the UK, or integrated into \nother parts of their global business. While the CMA can always impose Orders where they \nare relevant to the UK market, the monitoring and enforcement of compliance in such \ncircumstances may be complex and entail legal proceedings in another jurisdiction. This may \nwell be a relevant issue in digital markets, especially if different authorities take conflicting \napproaches to the same issues, creating a clear need for discussion and collaboration with \ninternational counterparties. In this regard, activity at European level \u2013 through a new \ncompetition tool - may prove rather easier than national-level interventions. ","1606":"A final negative of MI is arguably more political than substantive. It is the corollary of one of \nthe major positives; the ability to impose very significant remedies. Unless expectations are \nvery carefully managed, this can lead to the build-up of unduly high expectations around \nMIs, which can in turn generate intense dissatisfaction with the CMA\u2019s performance when it \nconcludes that only moderate remedies are justified. The CMA faced substantial criticism of \nthis sort in 2016, at the conclusion of two major market investigations into retail banking \nand energy. ","1607":"There can also be a need to manage expectations about the likely speed and scale of impact \nfor MI remedies. In some markets, while remedies can reduce the extent of competition \nproblems, they may not be able to overcome them entirely. Meanwhile, some remedies \u2013 \nindeed, often the better remedies such as Open Banking \u2013 can take some time to be \neffective. ","1608":"The UK experience suggests that market investigations would be a valuable addition to the \nCommission\u2019s competition toolkit, in digital markets and more widely. However, given the \nlimitations discussed above, in particular around the flexibility, monitoring and enforcement \nof remedies, they are unlikely to be a panacea for competition concerns in digital platforms. \nIndeed, at the conclusion of its market study in Online Platforms and Digital Advertising, the \nCMA decided not to commence a formal market investigation. It did so on the basis that the \nUK Government was likely to be introducing ex ante regulation in this area and that it would \nbe preferable to intervene via that route so far as possible.  ","1609":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIt is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission is also consulting on the potential for a \nnew ex ante regulatory instrument for large digital platforms. But this leaves a residual \nquestion. In the context of digital platforms, would there be merit in the EU also introducing \nthe New Competition Tool as a complement to such ex ante regulation? ","1610":"The incremental value of MIs in the context of regulation will clearly depend on the powers \nto be incorporated within such any ex ante regulatory framework. Option 3 is the key option \nin the European Commission\u2019s proposals, and it has two potential elements. Sub-option 3a \nwould involve the \u2018prohibition or restriction of certain unfair trading practices by large \nonline platforms acting as gatekeepers (\u201cblacklisted\u201d practices)\u2019. Sub-option 3b would \nenable the adoption of \u2018tailor-made remedies addressed to large online platforms acting as \ngatekeepers on a case-by-case basis where necessary and justified\u2019.  ","1611":"As mentioned above, structural interventions have in fact been imposed only rarely in MIs. \nHowever, it is noteworthy that the CMA Online Platforms and Digital Advertising market \nstudy identified a serious conflict of interest associated with Google\u2019s strong position at \nvarious levels in the advertising intermediation value chain. It concluded that the proposed \nUK regulator should have the power to introduce different forms of separation, from \noperational separation to full ownership separation. The CMA\u2019s findings thus confirm that \nthe power to impose structural remedies may well prove valuable but also highlight that this \npower could potentially be given to a regulator, rather than reserved for MIs.  ","1612":"The second gap relates to the need for market-wide interventions to promote competition. \nIt would clearly be possible to impose certain ex ante regulations symmetrically to all \nmarket participants, as indeed occurs under the EU Regulatory Framework for \ncommunications. However, the ex ante regulation instrument that is currently proposed \nwould allow requirements to be placed only on the largest digital platforms. Since \ninterventions will be best applied to all firms across a market, this may provide a valuable \nrole for an MI.  ","1613":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fUK in 1995, following an MI-like review. Making this a market-wide requirement, rather \nthan simply imposing it on the incumbent supplier British Telecom, was important for giving \nconsumers confidence that they could keep their phone number not only if they switched \naway from the incumbent but also if they later switched back.  ","1614":"This was a situation where a market-wide intervention was required in order to open up \ncompetition to a strong incumbent supplier, but \u2013 as the discussion above highlights \u2013 \nmarket-wide interventions can also be valuable for enhancing competition when there are \nmultiple players in a market. Indeed, number portability itself is today required in mobile \ntelephony markets, where there are typically multiple players. It is important for facilitating \nthe switching required for effective competition and it has been shown to have a substantial \nimpact in reducing prices.17 The majority of the MI interventions in the Table 1 above were \napplied to multiple firms across the market, and designed to enhance competition generally \nrather than specifically to open up monopolised markets. ","1615":"As is emphasised in the Commission\u2019s Inception Impact Assessment, market-wide \ninterventions can also be valuable in preventing markets from tipping. Again, the \ntelecommunications sector offers a useful example, with the rules around interconnection \nbeing valuable in ensuring a level playing field for competition that overcomes the tendency \ntowards concentration that would otherwise exist. Consider an alternative world in which \nthere were no ability to interconnect across mobile telephony networks. In that world, the \nnatural consumer desire to access as wide a network of contacts as possible would likely \nresult in the market tipping to monopoly.  ","1616":"The complementary role that the two proposed tools might play can be considered through \na thought experiment. Consider the thorny issue of interoperability. Like number portability, \ninteroperability can be valuable both in opening up a monopolised market to competition \nand also in facilitating effective competition within a non-monopolised market. In the \nformer case, it may potentially be sufficient to impose interoperability only on the \nmonopoly firm, but in either case it may also be valuable to impose it more widely. ","1617":"Interoperability can also work to prevent currently non-monopolised digital markets from \n\u2018tipping\u2019 to monopoly, for much the same reasons as interconnectivity in telecoms. This has \nan important implication: it may be valuable to impose interoperability at an early stage in \nthe development of a market.18 A current example might be the market for self-driving cars, \nwhere such a requirement may be important for generating effective competition, and \nindeed maximising safety. ","1618":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn the intervening 18 years, we have all learned a lot. The potential of MIs has been more \nthoroughly tested, while the limitations of standard competition law, and especially abuse \nof dominance provisions, have become more apparent. The Commission\u2019s consultation on a \nNew Competition Tool is therefore both welcome and timely. There are lessons to be drawn \nfrom the UK experience of MIs for the implementation of such a regime at EU level. For \nexample, because the tool is potentially so powerful and flexible, it merits strong procedural \nchecks and balances, to guard against confirmation bias or politicisation. At the same time, \nthere is significant room for improvement within the current UK regime in relation to the \npowers around remedy flexibility and enforcement.   ","1619":"Nonetheless, the UK experience also confirms that the New Competition Tool has the \npotential to be hugely helpful, both in the digital sphere and more widely. But the tool also \nhas inherent limitations and thus should not be viewed as a full solution to the issues raised \nby digital platforms, but rather as a valuable complementary tool alongside new ex ante \nregulation.

Whether or not \nan additional legal instrument to the DSA is necessary to address structural competition problems is largely \ngoing to be a function of how wide in scope and effective in practice the DSA is likely to be, it being understood \nthat the P2B Regulation already constitutes an initial (but incomplete) regulatory step in that direction. There \nneeds to be a balance between the addition of new regulatory tools which can complement the work of \ncompetition rules and the need to not over-regulate to the point where innovation might be impaired.   ","1639":"In addition to targeted ex ante regulation, we consider that the Commission should review and update certain \nof its current competition law guidelines and notices in order to ensure that they are fit for purpose for the \nmodern, digital economy. For example, we support the (ongoing) consultation on the Commission\u2019s Notice on \nMarket Definition, and believe it is also necessary to review and update the Article 102 Enforcement Priorities \nGuidelines, the Horizontal and Vertical Guidelines, the Horizontal Merger Guidelines (in particular on innovation \neffects) and Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines (in particular on conglomerate effects).  This is necessary to \nprovide businesses with greater certainty and increase the competitiveness of European firms that could \nchallenge current gatekeeper platforms in certain markets and could compete more effectively in other \nemerging digital markets. It is also necessary because both companies and the Commission currently lack \nclear guidance on how EU competition law rules will be applied to new and emerging business models and \npotential theories of harm in the digital economy.  As noted in our response to the Roadmap and IIA for this \nconsultation, revised guidance from the Commission should in particular support a more dynamic approach to \nassessing competition in digital markets.  ","1640":"In addition, we support the increased use of existing powers available to the Commission, including interim \nremedies powers and sector inquiries. The Commission should endeavour to make greater use of these \npowers to better understand markets as they develop and evolve, and to intervene at an early stage, where \nappropriate, in markets characterised by presence of gatekeeper platforms which are prone to leveraging, anti-\ncompetitive monopolisation strategies, tipping, etc. In our view, the competition problems arising in these \nmarkets can be tackled by enforcing existing antitrust law more frequently and in a more timely manner and \ntargeted ex ante regulation of digital markets where gatekeepers have undermined or eliminated \ncontestability. To the extent that the DSA introduces market monitoring obligations, it is arguable that \nenforcement of the current competition laws would be more effective.  ","1641":"We believe that introducing a new competition tool carries a significant risk of over-enforcement which distorts \ncompetitive outcomes (in particular by chilling investment and innovation).  Vodafone therefore considers that \nthe Commission should: (a) proceed with the implementation of targeted ex ante regulation to tackle the \nspecific concerns which arise in markets characterised by the presence of gatekeeper platforms; and (b) make \nmore use of and update its existing competition law tools and guidance.   In addition, the Commission should \nconsider (again, as an alternative to a New Competition Tool) widening the scope of its existing powers \nunder Regulation 1\/2003 to enable it to make recommendations to companies, sectoral regulators and \nlegislators following sector inquiries, which would seem to be a more proportionate and legitimate way to \nproceed.. We do not believe there is a need currently for any additional  form of  intervention, including \none that takes the form of the proposed \u201cNew Competition Tool\u201d, which should only be pursued if the \nmeasures referred to above, once implemented, prove to be ineffective and once the results of current Court \nappeals in the various digital platform cases have been resolved. ","1642":"c.  No notice given of technical changes to platforms, which then requires apps to be amended, in some \ncases resulting in lack of functionality. By not being provided with such advance notice, Vodafone is left \nexposed to technical issues that can stop services working and harm its reputation with customers. This \ncan also impact functionality which may affect Vodafone\u2019s compliance with regulatory requirements.   ","1643":"Apple forces developers to charge their customers via the App Store payment system , rather than through \nthe developer\u2019s website or some other means) and to share a significant proportion of the revenue with \nApple, thereby effectively increasing third party developers\u2019 costs and hindering their ability to compete \nwith Apple\u2019s own services. ","1644":"g.  Use of superior access to data, which we understand to be the potential concern of the Commission in \nlaunching an investigation into whether Amazon\u2019s access to data in its role as a merchant platform \nadversely affects downstream competition in online retailing between Amazon and its rivals. (The parallels \nare significant between the proposed DSA regulatory intervention and the approach adopted under Article \n106 TFEU with regard to firms that have a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d in their commercial dealings and their rule-\nsetting functions, as this conflict fuels self-preferencing practices.) ","1645":"We do not agree that a highly concentrated market is problematic per se from a competition perspective.  As \nwith other markets, the potential for competition concerns to arise in oligopolistic markets depends on the \nspecific characteristics of the market in question.  For example, while a \u201ctight\u201d oligopoly market structure may \nfacilitate tacit collusion in certain industries, this depends on a number of factors.  For example, the risk will be \nhigher in markets characterised by homogeneous products with high common and transparent cost bases.  \nHowever, concentrated market structures are still likely to produce competitive outcomes where the product \nranges of market players are diverse and where customers can switch easily and at relatively little cost.     ","1646":"\uf0b7  Operator profitability and return on capital are currently relatively low in these markets (in contrast to \nmany digital markets). This is a clear indication of their highly competitive nature. Relatively low \nprofitability and return on capital expenditure in telecoms markets where there is competing \ninfrastructure does not enable the same financial leverage used to support market power as in digital \nmarkets. It is only in those telecoms markets where a position of clear market  dominance exists (e.g., \nwholesale fixed access, which is dominated by one fixed incumbent in most countries) that profits are \nraised  and incumbents are regulated while, in those markets that are contestable, profitability is low \nand competition is fierce even under an oligopolistic market structure (e.g., as in the mobile sector). \nThe status quo of these markets is \u201creset\u201d regularly as operators are required to roll out new \ntechnologies approximately every five to seven years, and there is fierce competition on network \nquality and capacity in the interim. \nThere is already well-established and effective sector-specific regulation in place which is based on \ncompetition law principles.  This regulation applies in addition to the \u201ctraditional\u201d competition law \nframework established in Airtours and Impala.   ","1647":"\uf0b7  Where operators enter into network sharing or other cooperation arrangements in order to facilitate \npro-competitive investment and innovation, resulting in the faster and wider rollout of new networks \nand\/or services to customers, such arrangements are already effectively policed under antitrust \nand\/or merger control rules. \nTo the extent that operators in markets have been required by regulators to increase transparency in \nrelation to their customer offers, this should not be interpreted as providing a foundation for tacit \ncollusion, but as providing the basis for informed end-user decision-making which in turn reduces the \nrisk of customers being rendered inert to change. ","1648":"\uf0b7  Are characterised by a different approach to innovation than digital markets, where the need for quick \nintervention is premised on the greater speed and less \u201cstructured\u201d form of innovation cycles that \ntake place there, along with the cumulative effect of various market features which can cause such \ndigital markets to tip.  ","1649":"Vodafone\u2019s experience therefore does not suggest that, as a matter of general principle, the Commission \nrequires additional tools to tackle potential competition law risks in oligopolistic markets. To the extent that \nsuch concerns may arise in certain markets based on their specific characteristics, and these cannot be tackled \nunder existing competition law rules, the example of the telecommunications sector illustrates that sector-\nspecific  regulation is probably the most effective means by which address such concerns arising from complex \noligopoly situations  (as is explained further in response to question 13.1 below).   ","1650":"Finally, we note that the Inception Impact Assessment for this consultation (the IIA) refers to the increasing \ndigitalisation of society and economy which has attracted increasing attention under competition policy, \nspecifically \u201cthe large platforms [that] have become gatekeepers for many digital and non-digital products and \nservices\u201d. Our understanding of the role of a gatekeeper is that it coincides with the accumulation of market \npower increasingly in the hands of one undertaking. This is consistent with the IIA, which refers to certain \nmarket characteristics (which are typically and in some cases uniquely present in digital markets) which \nunderpin this development, including extreme economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, zero \npricing and data dependency. The IIA identifies that it is specifically against this backdrop that it has engaged in \na process of reflection on the role of competition policy in order to assess whether the current competition law \nframework allows for intervention that preserves competitive digital markets. Against this backdrop, there is \nnothing that has been put forward in the IIA which suggests that oligopoly market structures are problematic \nper se and\/or require intervention in the form of the proposed New Competition Tool to maintain or improve \ncompetition in those digital markets.   ","1651":"(i) The existence of a well understood and defined digital \u201cplatform\u201d or Internet eco-system of products \nthat lies above regulated telecommunications networks, which generates direct and indirect network effects \nthat might be capable of deterring switching by the creation of \u201cpositive feedback loops\u201d, or which is prone to \nthe phenomenon of \u201ctipping\u201d in favour of a particular operator (or a very limited group of operators).  ","1652":"We consider that an online platform accords in principle with an \u201cInformation Society service\u201d, as defined in EU \nDirective  2015\/1535.  This  would  have  the  following  characteristics:  (i)  the  ability  to  create  and  shape  new \nmarkets, to challenge traditional ones, and to organise new forms of participation or conducting business based \non the collection, processing, and editing of large volumes of data; (ii) operating in multi-sided markets, but with \nvarying  degrees  of  control  over  direct  interactions  between  groups  of  users;  (iii)  benefitting  from  \u2018network \neffects\u2019 where, broadly speaking, the value of the service increases with the number of users; (iv) often relying \non information and communications technologies to reach their users, instantaneously; (v) playing a key role in \ndigital value creation, by capturing significant value (often through data accumulation), which facilitates new \nbusiness ventures but also new strategic dependencies. ","1653":"In  addition,  when  there  are  elements  of  \u201cfree\u201d  provisioning  of  service,  which  may  increase  information \nasymmetries and have the tendency to mask commercial incentives, the rationale for public intervention may \nincrease. This can be the case when \u2018price\u2019 reflects a digital representation of value, particularly in the form of \npersonal data that is provided in exchange for the supply of the services in question. ","1654":"(i) The digital platform\u2019s business model is associated with the provision of some form of intermediation \nbetween two types of users across various sides of the platform. This implies that the platform in question allows \na user to offer goods or services to other users with a view to facilitating transactions between them. ","1655":"(ii) The digital platform would act as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d or as a provider of some form of a \u201cbottleneck facility\u201d, \nwhich renders it an \u201cunavoidable trading partner\u201d (comparable to a \u201cmust have\u201d product in a conglomerate \nmarket environment) for other operators on that digital platform (which would include a \u2018digital eco-system\u2019). ","1656":"Countervailing buying power may result from the relative size of customers or their commercial significance to \nthe  dominant  firm,  and  their  ability  to  switch  quickly  to  competing  suppliers.  In  this  way,  new  entry  can  be \npromoted or vertical integration can take place, at least where customers can credibly threaten to do so. ","1657":"(iv)  Existing  regulatory  obligations  are  not  effective  in  preventing  the  digital  platform  in  engaging  in \nexclusionary  behaviour.  To  the  extent  that  a  digital  platform  is  exploiting  a  regulatory  loophole,  or  where \nregulation (either asymmetric of symmetric in nature) is not capable of exerting a meaningful market discipline \non the platform, additional regulatory intervention is likely to be a proportionate response.  ","1658":"On the assumption that either a finding of dominance cannot be established in relation to a particular digital \nplatform (despite positive findings usually associated with market power) or the identified conduct and effects \ncannot be effectively addressed pursuant to appropriate remedies under ex post competition rules and \nwithin a reasonable period of time given the speed of technology and market evolution, there is a risk that the \nchanges effected to the marketplace are irreversible and the possibility of innovation from other competitors is \nforegone unless regulatory intervention occurs.  ","1659":"\uf0b7  Self-preferencing strategies, where digital platforms often use their gatekeeper role to favour their \nown content, service or advertising (when vertically integrated), or to favour paid-for content by certain \ncontent providers or advertisers in effect by discriminating against other competing users. This is the \ncase, for example, when search and ranking algorithms confer preference to the platform\u2019s own services \nabove those of competitors or when the digital platform has an incentive to bias its recommendations \ntoward  the  content  provider  charging  a  lower  royalty.  The  fact  that  the  digital  platform  may  have \nsuperior information about consumer preferences increases the risk of bias. This is also the case when \nthe platform does not treat third party applications the same way as its own applications.  ","1660":"\uf0b7  Leveraging  into  neighbouring  markets  is  a    common  practice  in  markets  with  digital  gatekeepers, \nwhich    can  rely  on  their  wide  portfolio  of  services  to  leverage  into  neighbouring  markets  where \ncompetition is foreclosed, or where  their entry alone is capable of  restricting the entry and expansion \nof new entrants (by raising their costs of doing business).

We increasingly see our customers being locked into digital eco-systems, rarely switching, \nwhile providing ever-increasing amounts of personal data which further ties them into that  eco-system.  ","1665":"As explained in our response to question 9.1 above, we believe the Commission should: (i) continue with \nits ongoing review of, and make certain important updates to, the existing competition law framework to \nensure it is fit for purpose; (ii) increase its use of existing powers in relation to interim measures and sector \ninquiries, and (iii) introduce an ex ante regulatory framework for digital gatekeepers , as set out in \nVodafone\u2019s separate response to the DSA consultation, before considering the need for a New \nCompetition Tool. The Commission should only consider further forms of intervention, including any \npotential New Competition Tool, once these reforms have been introduced and assessed, and if they are \nshown to be ineffective in addressing the specific competition problems that the Commission is seeking \nto address. ","1666":"\uf0b7  The existing competition law framework is sufficient to address structural competition problems \nin many cases, especially if the Commission expedites enforcement action (e.g. through use of \ninterim measures as we have suggested above and revises certain Guidelines and Notices (as \nexplained above -see in particular the response to question 9). \nIn particular, we believe the following revisions to Guidelines and Notices will not only enable \nmore efficient and dynamic enforcement of competition, but will be beneficial for competition in \nthe EU: ","1667":"consideration of theories of harm that arise from vertical and conglomerate foreclosure \nconcerns in digital markets, especially given the prevalence of those sorts of concerns in \nthe digital world, the similar approach to foreclosure adopted under both sets of \nconcerns, and because of the development in thinking about such foreclosure concerns \narising in recent merger practice both in the EU and elsewhere, as these types of \nconcerns pose the greatest threat to competition-related barriers for European firms \nwishing to enter the digital space where firms from other jurisdictions (predominantly \nthe US) are already present.  ","1668":"o  The Article 102 Enforcement Priorities Guidelines should be updated to specifically \naddress the impact of certain types of digital market business models, identify \ncompetition problems associated with the exploitation of such business models, and \nexplain further the rationale behind potential theories of harm that might apply in \nmarkets with digital gatekeepers.  ","1669":"Horizontal Merger Guidelines (in particular on conglomerate effects)   \n\uf0b7  The Commission already has extensive powers to gather information about markets where it \nbelieves that it is not working as well as it should in part due to competition problems in that \nmarket or sector, and to intervene where it is necessary to address irreparable harm to \ncompetition and\/or consumers. In our view, many of the types of competition concerns that the \nCommission has raised through this consultation could be addressed through greater use of \ninterim measures powers and sector inquiries, which might require relatively minor \namendments to Regulation 1\/2003 and which are unlikely to meet with much political \nopposition at the Member State level.  For example, sector inquiry powers could be strengthened \nto give the Commission the power to make recommendations to sector regulators and\/or \nlegislators. ","1670":"remedies without the need to satisfy the burden of proof required for a finding of \ninfringement of competition law must be approached with great caution in any circumstances.  \nIt is questionable whether a new competition tool would be proportionate or legitimate, in \nparticular as it would give the Commission significant powers to intervene in markets without \ngoing through the legislative process (e.g. without involving the European Parliament and the \nCouncil of Ministers) as it is the case today when the Commission wants to impose remedies after \na sector enquiry. ","1671":"At a more fundamental level, one must question whether the legal basis upon which the Commission \nproposes to act can in fact be Article 103 TFEU, read in combination with Article 114 TFEU. Given that the \nproposed New Competition Tool is proposing to extend the Commission\u2019s powers beyond those granted \nunder Article 101 and 102, it is difficult to see how the proposed measures could be considered to \u201cgive \neffect to the principles\u201d set forth in those Treaty Articles. By the same token, Article 114 TFEU is designed \nto achieve harmonization in approach as between Member State enforcement, which is also clearly not \nthe policy basis which is driving the new proposed measures.  ","1672":"\uf0b7  With regard to the question of whether it should be dominance-based or market-structure based, \nit should apply to different related markets in which a gatekeeper platform is active and \nwhich can, due to the structural features of the markets, leverage and extend their market power \nacross different relevant markets (not necessarily the individual market where that gatekeeper \nhas market power).  See the response to question 18.8 above for our proposed definition of \ngatekeeper. \nIts scope should be limited to digital markets that have tipped, or are on the verge of tipping, \ntowards dominance by a single gatekeeper firm (defined by reference to the criteria set out in \nresponse to question 18.8 and in our separate DSA consultation response) resulting in a \nstructural lack of, or identifiable adverse effects on, competition.  Vodafone\u2019s experience does \nnot suggest that it needs to deal with complex oligopoly issues, as explained above, \nVodafone\u2019s experiences do not suggest that there are any identifiable candidates beyond digital \nmarkets that would justify such an intervention.   ","1673":"\uf0b7  The New Competition Tool must be subject to various checks and balances in terms of its \nscope\/threshold, process, remedies and appeal rights \u2013 see our response to questions 29, 30 \nand in Section E below. Currently, the UK regime from which we understand the proposed New \nCompetition Tool takes inspiration has a series of essential procedural checks and balances \nwhich are not currently available under the EU competition law regime.  ","1674":"\uf0b7  The Commission should only be able to intervene in markets pursuant to an investigation under \nthe new competition tool if it can show adverse effects on competition to a sufficiently high level \nof standard of proof. \nFinally, to the extent that a New Competition Tool equips the Commission with the power to \nimpose remedies, these should be limited non-binding remedies to companies, \nrecommendations\/proposals to sector-specific regulators and\/or legislative \nrecommendations. We do not believe the Commission should be able to impose binding \nremedies on companies in circumstances where it is not first required to establish an \ninfringement of Article 101 or 102.

As suggested above, ","1675":"Amadeus is an IT company, which serves the global travel and tourism industry and provides technology solutions to travel service providers \u2013 for example, airlines, airports and hotels \u2013 and to travel sellers \u2013 for example, travel agencies and tour operators \u2013 worldwide.Amadeus\u2019 main activities include:  \n(a) the provision of an airline ticket distribution system traditionally referred to as the Global Distribution System (GDS) or Computer Reservation System (CRS), and now called Amadeus Travel Platform, as well as related IT products and services; a GDS connects travel service providers (airlines, hotels, railway companies, car rental companies, cruise lines, etc.) with travel sellers to enable search, booking and ticketing of travel services;\n(b) IT solutions for airlines (for example booking engines for their websites), hospitality companies, airports and ground handlers; and \n(c) payment, business intelligence, mobile and digital advertising solutions to travel industry players worldwide.Amadeus provides IT solutions as a B2B player, i.e. it provides inter alia travel service providers and travel agencies with digital products and services that they can use to interact with travelers. However, Amadeus does not provide any digital products or services directly to consumers, with the exception of a mobile application called CheckMyTrip which can be used to consult and modify travel itineraries.Amadeus' customers include online travel agencies, metasearch companies, airlines and hotels which constitute an important part of its business. Traffic to their websites depends to a significant extent on traffic generated by general search engines such as Google. Amadeus also uses and intends to use cloud services provided by large digital players.A structural competition problem can arise when a combination of the above features exists in a given market. In our view, the most important elements are a combination of B, G, H, I, J, N and P. Markets with players that are vertically integrated and active in various markets, at least one of which is characterized by extreme economies of scale\/scope, high switching costs and strong network effects, who are able to exploit unique assets such as extensive data that is not available to its competitors and who compete with part of its users may have structural competition problems. Such players are so indispensable that regulatory intervention is required to correct the structural competition problems they generated.Companies that leverage their market power in their core market to extend it to adjacent markets, excluding competitors on such adjacent markets by anti-competitive behavior, must be subject to regulation or enforcement action in addition to competition law. Examples of such anti-competitive behavior include (a) unjustified self-preferencing (i.e., giving preferential treatment of own products and services on the core market where the company has market power to extend this to neighboring markets where they face competition), (b) using and monetizing consumer data that is not available to competitors and using it across products and services to conquer new markets and (c) cross-subsidizing activities in markets where they face competition (e.g., selling below cost or zero-pricing) by using monopoly rents derived from markets where they act as a gatekeeper.Search engines and vertical products displayed (with preferential treatment) on the search engine results page. See answer to question 8.3 for further details.If done by exclusionary or anti-competitive strategies, such as unjustified self-preferencing, cross-data usage or cross-subsidization, such extension of market power into adjacent markets may result in distortion of competition on those adjacent markets.The Commission must intervene when such leveraging distorts competition. It can enforce Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and\/or apply ex ante regulation.Several companies in the travel industry complained to the Commission about Google's behavior and lodged formal complaints in 2012 under Article 102 TFEU. Eight years later the investigation of such complaints remains open and no adequate measures have been taken to remedy Google's behavior, as the Commission focused its resources on anti-competitive behavior in relation to other Google verticals. Such lengthy investigations or the absence of enforcement of Article 102 TFEU have resulted in a situation where the travel search market is tipping in favor of Google, thus distorting competition and reducing consumer choice. There is a need for other types of intervention that would allow anti-competitive conduct or structural competition problems to be investigated and remedied faster.Search engines and related verticals (travel search)Google uses data generated through is search engine or advertising business to extend its position on other markets where it is subject to competition. Its ability to internally combine and use data across products and services may enable Google to dominate new markets through cross-subsidization. For example, for Google Flight Search, Google no longer charges airlines a fee to display their offers. However, Google subsidizes the product by collecting data that it will monetize through search or display ads. This strategy is impossible to match even for more efficient rivals in the flights search market, as it would require them at the same time to enter the general search engines market, where Google\u2019s position is incontestable.\nFurthermore, Google gives preferential treatment without any objective justification to its own travel verticals in its search engine results page. Such self-preferencing demotes Google's competitors in travel (metasearch engines and online travel agencies) and forces them to increase their advertising spend with Google to remain visible.See answer to question 10.3See answer to question 10.3.The Commission must intervene when such anti-competitive monopolisation distorts competition. It can enforce Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and\/or apply ex ante regulation.Current enforcement procedures without deadlines to close an investigation are insufficient to tackle these types of anti-competitive monopolisation strategies in a timely and effective manner. By the time an investigation results in concrete steps, irreparable harm to competition and consumers has already occurred.","1676":"Under certain conditions (e.g., pricing algorithms that contain data that is not sufficiently aggregated) such algorithms can reduce competition by creating too much transparency on competitor behavior and can be used as a vehicle to exchange competitively sensitive information in violation of Article 101 TFEU.The current framework of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, in particular the rules on exchange of information between competitors, is sufficient to tackle competition issues caused by pricing algorithms.Search engines (Google); certain social mediaConsumer markets characterized by strong network effects, extreme economies of scale and a high degree of single-homing (explained by high switching costs) are particularly prone to tipping.Certain digital B2C markets such as search engines, social media, marketplaces for shopping, etc. benefit from and are characterized by strong network effects, extreme economies of scale and a high degree of single-homing of users.We believe all the above are very important concerns in tipping markets.In B2C markets that present the characteristics of a tipping market, early intervention may be needed to preserve effective competition.Current enforcement of articles 101 and 102 TFEU with no deadlines to conclude an investigation are insufficient because markets will have already tipped in favor of one undertaking by the time a decision is adopted.General search engines, certain social media","1677":"In addition to the above criteria, the ability to leverage its unique assets (data, customer base, technological assets, etc.) into new markets and exclude rivals is also a key element to define gatekeepers. Also, the market needs to be characterized by high barriers to entry and strong economies of scale before a company can be qualified as a gatekeeper.In addition to the above, the ability to leverage its unique assets (data, customer base, technological assets, etc.) into new markets and exclude rivals, for example by unjustified self-preferencing, cross-data usage and cross-subsidization, is a key competition concern.Regulatory intervention against anti-competitive practices by gatekeepers is needed to preserve or restore competition and maintain consumer choice and innovation.Ex ante regulation is needed because current enforcement of articles 101 and 102 is insufficient to timely and adequately tackle and remedy anti-competitive conduct of certain gatekeepers.We believe that structural competition problems that cannot be tackled by enforcement of articles 101 and 102 TFEU exist in certain digital markets. However, the same structural problems can also be present in non-digital markets. In any event, as many markets become increasingly digitalized, the distinction between digital and non-digital is becoming gradually blurred and irrelevant.","1678":"We believe that structural competition problems in markets where no company is dominant can be tackled by Article 101 TFEU. We suggest that enforcement be made subject to clear timelines to give companies greater legal certainty.Not applicableCurrent enforcement of Article 102 TFEU is not sufficient to effectively tackle and remedy certain structural competition problems in markets where gatekeepers are active. Enforcement action takes too long to result in a decision that is timely and effective to remedy the structural competition problems. Examples include unjustified self-preferencing, data usage across multiple products and services and cross-subsidization.General search enginesWe believe that structural competition problems in markets where gatekeepers operate can be addressed either by the proposed ex ante regulation under the DSA or by faster enforcement of competition law as it exists today, including clear timelines for investigations.

It is unclear how structural risks for competition or a structural lack of competition could be addressed by imposing ex ante remedies on non-dominant companies. In addition, existing competition law provisions (art. 101 TFEU) can be used to prohibit anti-competitive agreements between non-dominant companies.","1680":"Markets where large B2C gatekeepers are active and engage in anti-competitive conduct.We believe that structural competition problems that cannot be tackled by enforcement of articles 101 and 102 TFEU exist in certain digital markets. However, the same structural problems can also be present in non-digital markets. In any event, as many markets become increasingly digitalized, the distinction between digital and non-digital is becoming gradually blurred and irrelevant.The Commission needs to delineate carefully what constitutes a \u201cstructural risk for competition\u201d or a \u201cstructural lack of competition\u201d before intervening and imposing remedies. It carries the burden of proof.","1681":"The existence of broad powers of intervention by the Commission based on unclear criteria can hinder or delay innovation in the market. Companies need to be able to predict, on the basis of sufficiently clear and well-defined criteria, what type of markets and what type of structural competition problems could become subject to investigation through the NCT before making any investment decisions.Proposals for remedies under the NCT, if any, should be proportionate, be addressed to the company on which they would be imposed for review and amendments and subject to comments by customers, suppliers and competitors, similar to the market testing in competition investigations.","1682":"Behavioral remedies may in certain circumstances also be appropriate, provided compliance with such remedies is frequently and duly monitored and there are financial penalties for non-compliance.A new tool that is not associated with investigative powers does not have any teeth and is useless.The New Competition Tool, if adopted, will be targeted at addressing structural competition problems, but will neither investigate companies for alleged anti-competitive behavior nor result in the imposition of fines. Carrying out inspections at companies that are not subject to an investigation would be disproportionate and not justified. On the other hand, it is important that the Commission has the power to request and obtain information (whether through a formal request for information or an interview) to get a good overview of the market and any structural problems that may exist. This will help the Commission decide what actions to take, if any.There must be clear and binding timelines for the Commission to handle its investigations and the market testing of remedies. This will allow companies to obtain legal certainty and recourse sooner compared to current investigations based on articles 101 and 102 TFEU.","1683":"Voluntary commitments are already possibility in art. 101 TFEU investigations and should also be offered under the New Competition Tool where companies are not subject to enforcement proceedings.Before adopting a final decision that could include remedies affecting not only the companies active in the market, but also their suppliers, competitors and customers, all these parties need to have the opportunity - within strict deadlines - to submit comments on the findings and proposals.Market testing of commitments offered under Article 9 of Regulation 1\/2003 is already a current practice. This should also be applicable whenever the New Competition Tool is applied, to offer the Commission the widest possible views before adopting remedies that could have a significant effect on market participants, but also on their suppliers, competitors and customers.Companies\u2019 rights of defense during Commission proceedings should be respected and full judicial review of Commission decisions must be available.The New Competition Tool (\"NCT\") should not be applied to players that are already subject to sector-specific ex ante regulation today \u2013 for example, CRS Code of Conduct, telecommunications, \u2026 If any structural problems persist in such markets, these should be addressed by this sector-specific regulation instead of the NCT.","1684":"It is unclear what added value the NCT would bring in addition to the ex ante regulatory framework under the DSA when it comes to large platforms acting as gatekeepers: structural risks for competition or a structural lack of competition in markets where these gatekeepers operate should be tackled by this specific DSA ex ante regulation.","1685":"We operate in Financial ServicesWe operate in Financial Services, and given the EC's definition of 'digital services' we understand that our services do not classify as such for the purposes of this consultation.We operate in Financial Services, and given the EC's definition of 'digital services' we understand that our services do not classify as such for the purposes of this consultation.As we exemplify throughout the consultation paper, these elements are associated with the structural competition problems of tipping, gatekeeper scenarios and the practice of a company with market power in a core market extending that market power to related marketsAs explained in detail further throughout our response, competition issues frequently arise as a result of the significant market power held by exchanges (referred to as 'Regulated Markets' in MIFID II).  These issues arise because, by their very nature, exchanges tend to be monopolistic:  they operate in, and tend to dominate, markets that have already 'tipped' as a result of  network effects caused by the benefits to both buyers and sellers of trading on an exchange with more liquidity.   Significantly, the vertically integrated silo with clearing underpins the dominance and gatekeeper function of an exchange in a particular instrument, as the need to maintain initial and variation margin against a centrally cleared instrument exerts a strong gravitational pull for all trading to take place in one location.","1686":"The many competition related concerns associated with the dominant position of exchanges in relation to  market data provision and pricing  are well documented, most recently in the Global Memo on Market Data Costs published by a group of trade associations last June. Firstly, the costs of market data have increased drastically (please see our response to 8.3). As many market participants cannot afford a perpetual cost increase, this has forced many professional data consumers to scale back their data purchases to an economically acceptable  level by deselecting certain in-vestments or markets. This especially applies to smaller companies and regional , foreign markets. This results in reduced transparency, decreased levels of cross-border competition and lower market integration. The consequences of these outcomes are less informed markets, weaker competition, and higher costs for investors.Various market participants have recommended the EC should regulate the prices of market data. We believe the intrinsic difficulties for authorities to establish a \u2018true\u2019 equilibrium price make this a troublesome and worrying  solution. Instead, we would recommend that the EC addresses the root cause of the behaviour of the exchanges, which is their dominance in execution and unchallenged grasp of total control of the vertical silo with clearing. By introducing more competition to the quasi monopolistic exchange vertically oriented execution model (for example through more reasonable and more difficult to be side-stepped  requirements for non-discriminatory access to clearing) exchanges will be less able to translate their dominant market power into a dominant position in other areas such as market data.We do not consider that Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are sufficient to address these concerns for a number of reasons.","1687":"(b)\tEven setting aside the legal constraints, it is often difficult to establish dominance as a result of contentious points concerning the way that the market in question operates.  This can make it very difficult to challenge a dominant company in relation to its conduct because: (i) the caseload of competition authorities inevitably means they have to prioritise certain cases and so they may be more reluctant to commit resources to investigating a case where there is not a clear case of dominance and so it may be difficult or complex to prove it; and (ii) although there is the alternative route of private enforcement, it is often prohibitively expensive to bring litigation under Article 102.","1688":"(c)\tFinally, it can often be difficult to establish that the behaviour concerned is abusive within the meaning of Article 102, even where it does cause significant harm to competition.  Although formally the list of prohibited conduct included in Article 102 itself is non-exhaustive and so in principle the prohibition can be applied to any conduct which restricts competition on the merits, in practice a competition authority or an undertaking which is trying to challenge harmful conduct through the courts is often constrained by the legal precedent. For example, conduct by a company which is trying to extend its market power into a related market may not necessarily fall within the strict tests required to prove abusive tying\/bundling, refusal to supply or discrimination.","1689":"Regulated Markets  are prime examples of tipping markets. This is because of the strong network effects associated with market liquidity (the ability to buy or sell an instrument without large movements in the price). The larger the number of participants on an exchange, the higher  the chances that willing buyers and sellers are able to cross at a price level that is agreeable to both parties. This leads to more price matching  and, by consequence, smaller price discovery  costs. For this reason, \u2018liquidity\u2019 (or trading activity) tends to concentrate on a limited amount of exchanges (with \u2018one\u2019 being the optimal number from a network-effect perspective).  Significantly, the vertical silo with clearing underpins the dominance of an exchange in a particular instrument as the need to maintain initial and variation margin against a centrally cleared instrument exerts a strong gravitational pull for all trading to take place in one location. (This issue is at the heart of Open Access where the trading community may still reap the gains of centralised margin management while simultaneously benefitting from more competitive and clearly transparent execution and data practices if and when execution in an instrument may occur in multiple exchange locations.)","1690":"This effect is reinforced by the economies of scale associated with setting up an exchange. Venues require significant technological investments and sunken costs associated with compliance with relevant regulations (financial instrument  trading is a highly regulated industry). The more participants the venue has, the more easily it is able to spread and recuperate those costs.","1691":"The above mentioned effects lead to \u2018natural\u2019 monopolies, and associated perverse incentives for monopolists which bring unfortunate  negative effects by limiting consumer choice and innovation and - ultimately - higher trading costs.

This can make it very difficult to challenge a dominant company in relation to its conduct because: (i) the caseload of competition authorities means they inevitably have to prioritise certain cases and so they may be more reluctant to commit resources to investigating a case where  there is not a clear case of dominance and so it may be difficult or complex to prove it; and (ii)  although there is the alternative route of private enforcement, it is often prohibitively expensive to bring litigation under Article 102.\n\u2022\tThe harm caused by markets tipping in favour of one company does not necessarily involve any abusive conduct at all \u2013 the harm may be caused simply by the structure of the market rather than by any deliberate unilateral conduct by a dominant company.  This would therefore not fall within Article 102 and, as a lacuna in the ability of the competition regime to control exploitation of market power, requires a new tool to address these concerns.Although we have no experience in the digital sector, we consider that gatekeeper scenarios are very common in the financial services industryAs per our answer to question 18.2, gatekeepers are prevalent in the financial markets, where exchanges control access to key elements of infrastructure that are needed to compete in various market segments. This has the effect of foreclosing access of competitors to these markets.Regarding \u2018High number of customers\u2019 as a parameter, it is not the number of customers that is relevant but the market share these customers represent. ","1695":"As per our answer to question 18.2, the total dependency of brokers on the terms and conditions of exchanges to which they bring their transactions for execution makes them prone to anti-competitive behaviour by these exchanges.Please see our answer to question 18.2.Addressing the gatekeeper scenarios  will bring important benefits to financial markets. Clearing instruments from multiple venues at a single CCP of choice could lead to substantial netting efficiencies, compared to clearing these at two different CCPs. This leads to capital efficiencies and cost reductions. \nOpen Access could also lead to lower execution costs and more innovation. Trading and clearing costs are closely interlinked. The cost of trading on a trading venue is assessed by market participants together with the associated clearing costs. A trading venue cannot be competitive if it cannot give access to attractive clearing choices . Without these provisions, new and non-vertically integrated trading venues would be prevented from entering the market and thus unable to contribute to a more competitive and a less concentrated market.  \nThe lower costs associated with competition go beyond execution and clearing. Exchanges use their dominant position in execution to build a similarly dominant position in the sales of trading data. As such, more competition in execution should lead to lower data costs. \nOpen Access also contributes to financial stability. An environment with multiple competing CCPs contributes to reducing systemic risk by strengthening CCP substitutability in case of failure.\nWe note that Open Access is addressed in sector specific regulation (MIFID II). However, EU legislators have delayed the entry into force of this regime multiple times, most recently on 3 JulyJuly 2020 when implementation  was delayed by one year to 3 July 2021. Furthermore, the criteria for Open Access, as further detailed in Delegated Regulation 2016\/3807 with MIFID II, have the combined effect of tilting the balance in favour of an incumbent CCP wishing to deny an Open Access request.\nThe legislation allows CCPs to refuse Open Access if, \u2018after making all reasonable efforts\u2019 there are \u2018significant undue risks that cannot be managed\u2019. The identification of such risks is at the ultimate discretion of the CCP, although the CCP must \u2018explain\u2019 its reasoning.  Some of the \u2018undue risks\u2019 (as listed in Delegated Regulation 2016\/3807) are sufficiently non-specific to make it relatively simple for a CCP to invoke.  This applies for example to a criterion such as \u2018incompatibility of IT systems\u2019 . Since IT systems are generally not open to public scrutiny, it is difficult to provide counter evidence to successfully challenge a claim by a CCP. Also, the National Competent Authority of the incumbent CCP is able to refuse an Open Access request if such request if such request is \u2018deemed a threat to smooth and orderly market functioning\u2019, \u2018adversely affects systemic risk\u2019 or leads to \u2018market fragmentation\u2019.

The development of a balanced digital ecosystem is at risk if not already compromised. \nRadio and television enterprises provide audiovisual content and services via broadcasting means and online.Radio and TV companies compete with large online platforms for:\nAttention and access to the user. Web multinationals  are largely dominant in the relationship with users (terminals, operating systems, apps) even in strategic sectors for user access such as voice assistance \nAdvertising: online advertising is the first medium for investments attracted (volume and number of investors) in European markets since 2014 (28 Member States, European Audiovisual Observatory data).\nAudiovisual content (Apple Tv, Google Chromecast, Youtube premium, Android TV, Amazon Video, Apple Music, Spotify, to name a few) and SVOD (Netflix)\nThe competitive problem (of the broadcasting operators) with the major online platforms is the persisting asymmetry (regulatory, fiscal) in a market that is already highly concentrated. Online platforms:\n1) disintermediate the relationship between broadcasters and their audience (eg profiling data for distribution of broadcasters\u2019 content)\n2) redistribute content often infringing copyright (authorization, remuneration, content integrity, attribution) Many of the broadcasters\u2019 contents are shared online, often illegally with an inactive but not totally passive role (indexing of contents, collection of advertising and user data) by intermediation platforms (e.g. social, cloud, search).\n3) disintermediate the relation with advertising investors (problems of attributing revenues and data to publishers, brand reputation and security);\n4) compete on offer to the public, the offers of audio and video content free or on subscription is often  combined with other services offered by the platforms;\n5) compete on resources: advertising online in all European markets already is or is close to become the first advertising medium. According to European Audiovisual Observatory data online advertising is the fisrt advertising medium in Europe of 28 since 2014. Online advertising often registers double-digit growth rates which compares to stable \/ slightly declining trends in \u201ctraditional media\u201d. Furthermore online advertising is highly concentrated in a few multinational operators (see below).\n6) insert user data at the center of a detailed profiling \/ tracking activity. Data often converge from  different online environments (e.g. Amazon marketplace and Amazon Video). These big data are highly strategic and monetizable assets (development, innovation, market knowledge).\n7) have incomparable (global) economies of scale and scope (through proprietary devices, apps, software and user interfaces) that further disintermediation;\n8) have unprecedented size, capitalization, investment capacity and market penetration\nOnline platforms extract revenue and value from the markets where they operate without returning value (eg employment, taxation). Online platforms benefit from this competitive advantage which profoundly alters the context where \"traditional\" companies operate, depriving them of the ability to compete, develop, innovate.A - One or a few large operators: Google is 1st global operator for online advertising (32%), followed by Facebook (19%). Amazon is 4th (3%), Microsoft 7th (2%) (AGCOM \"Report on Online Platforms\" slide 2.3. ). Globally, the first 2 operators  account for 51% of online advertising, in Italy (AGCOM, August 2020) online advertising has became the 1st advertising medium with 41%. Online advertising grows at a much higher pace than all others media and is higly concentrated, 68% of online advertising in Italy is collected by only 1% of operators: they are multinational web companies with a high turnover threshold. From p. 3 \u201cThe economic characteristics of the sector (network externalities, economies of scale, sunk costs, obstacles to multi-homing and the presence of switching costs) spontaneously lead to particularly concentrated equilibria. Finally, the vast number of users reached gives platforms the availability of large amounts of data that allows accurate user profiling and, therefore, allows advertisers to reach specific targets \". These are businesses based on advertising - Facebook online advertising generates 99% of revenues, Google 85% (AGCOM, Observatory of online platforms slide 2.2.) - with zero-pricing service offers economies of scope and network effects that generate user lock-in.Worldwide, the platforms occupy the first positions in all sectors of activity both upstream and downstream of the industrial chain in which they operate (desktop, Microsoft 77%; mobile, Google 75%). \u201cNetwork externalities (direct, indirect and crossed), increasing returns to scale, obstacles to multihoming and sunk costs tend to generate an increase in the level of concentration. Factors are present simultaneously or in combination lead to \u201cwinner takes all\u201d situations\u201d. (AGCOM, Report on Online Platforms, slide 2.3)\nB - High degree of vertical integration  (AGCOM, Report on online platforms Slide 2.1  and 2.3).   Competition of large platforms with radioTv broadcaster increases in case of specialization of activities (eg. Neflix, 1st in the world with 51% of SVOD services economies of scale and scope,). SVOD market appears to be more contestable.  \nC- High start-up costs (R&D) and breakeven (AGCOM, Report on online platforms, Slide 1.7). \"The average gross profitability of the main online platforms (Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple Netflix) is equal to 49%, due to the low marginal costs and the huge fixed (and submerged) costs, which lead to the global exploitation of increasing returns to scale. The operation of these forces increases the breakeven point and makes digital markets less contestable.\" AGCOM, Ibidem, slide 1.9. Breakeven is concerned: e-commerce, 50+ billion euros revenues; search: 20+ billion euros revenue; social network 10+ billion euros: and growth rate increases by 2-digit rates YoY (AGOM, ibidem, slide 2.5). \nE - Impossibility to access a specific production factor (eg data). Large online platforms are by far leaders on collecting data. The value and competitive advantage provided by big data analytics is measured in ARPU  and ranges from 37 euros for Google search to 21\/11 respectively for Facebook and Instagram to 10 for Youtube (entertainment ). AGCOM, ibidem, Slide 3.2. In Italy the ARPU generated in a year by data of a single user of a large online platform is on average 5 times as much as that generated by a major national publisher (online editors and portals): figures underline the difficulty for publishers to compete on advertising online (AGCOM ibidem, slide 3.3.) \nM - Single-homing - very concentrated areas and low level of multi-homing in free services. Google has 88% in search, 53% email, 91% maps, 72% mobile app store; Facebook 76% social networks, 95% instant messaging. These figures, induced by strong network externalities, are associated with low levels of multihoming compared to the first operator. \"The joint operation of these factors and the feedback of multiverse markets is likely to affect the level of concentration of online advertising revenues\". AGCOM, slide 2.4\nO - Significant financial power (AGCOM, Report on online platforms slide 1.1 and 1.2). : 7 of the world's top 10 companies for market capitalization are held by multinationals operating online, risen to such positions in 10 years.\nQ - Data dependence. The growth of online platforms is fuelled by the production of huge masses of data. AGCOM in collaboration with the Privacy the Antitrust Authorities (Indagine conoscitiva sui Big Data, 2\/2020) underlines the role of data in current and future digital economy: big data grow in importance and value \"on account of the growing importance assumed in the organization of production and exchange activities, to the point of being able to be considered, in addition to the projection of the person in the digital world, an economic resource in ain all respects, indeed the most important resource in many sectors \".All scenarios appear highly probable, already in place and often at the same time. They configure structural competition problems and make the markets where big online platforms operate hard to contest. Furthermore size, transnationality, investment capacity and unprecedented market capitalization provide online platforms with additional competitive advantage in several markets, not necessarily contiguous. They also show capability of acquiring new assets and operators. According to AGCOM, the digitalization of economy has led to a paradigmatic discontinuity, called \"platforming\" of the economy. Discontinuity needs to be addressed with adequate tools.The above mentioned economies of scale and scope and network esternalities facilitate the extension to contiguous markets as well as the pervasiveness of multisided businesses and users lock in.Barriers to entry, price increases (i.e. talent or rights for the broadcasting sector); homogenization of products and services; user lock in; over-the-law \/ non-transparent exploitation of content (copyright); exploitation of big data and profiling.We support a New Competition Tool which, as outlined by Executive Vice-President Vestager in her statement to the US Congress prior the Hearing of tech CEOs on 29 July 2020,  \u201cwould complement both existing case enforcement under Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty, as well as the possible ex ante regulation that would apply to digital gatekeeper platforms\u201d.","1702":"Online advertising. Big data.See above question 6 commentsMonopolization occurs in the case of large multi-national of the web that operate over the networks (hence the term OTT) and over the law, stateless for the purpose of imposing rules, operating on a global scale, not liable to businesses, users, markets.The anticompetitive monopolization operated by large online platforms creates an unbalanced ecosystem to the detriment of minor or national operators who see their business at risk of sustainability or acquisition. The risk of levelling prices, practices or products to the detriment of the consumers and the businesses (advertising investors but also traditional media national markets), is very high. In the radio and television sector, where the services offered to the public are information, entertainment, culture, pluralism and cultural identity are at stake.Re-establish the level playing field is of primary importance. It is necessary to create a regulatory system that obliges the platforms to greater transparency and accountability on the basis of the national and supranational principles that bind all EU operators. Current tools may \/ may not be enough. There is certainly a need for greater coordination and exchange of information among national authorities and with the Commission; and more timely and effective control, and intervention and enforcement tools.","1703":"To overcome the structural problems (risks and scenarios) associated with monopolization of digital markets by major online platforms, EU equip itself with a regulatory framework that takes into account the current situation and the risks for future developments, guaranteeing a \"level playing field\" with operators competing with big online platforms.","1704":"Tools may include pro-competitive measures in favour of local market contenders (eg. legislative lightening, simplification) and regulatory measures (e.g. on transparency, accountability). With specific regards to radiotv sector:,search optimization principles for information and audiovisual content (algorithm transparency); accountability of platforms with respect to contents conveyed (inhibition of illegal dissemination), fair remuneration, control of dissemination by the right holders (copyright); right prominence of editorial content on platforms; guarantee access to the data generated by publishers' contents; facilitate data portability and mobility between platforms through the adoption of interoperable standards.\t","1705":"\nEg search, social media,  are markets where economies of scale and scope have a fundamental impact on resources (advertising or paid services). The number of users reached and operating on a global scale also generates economies of scale in the production of new services (eg big data and artificial intelligence strategic assets for development). In the radio and television sector, competition from operators with global economies of scale and scope also facilitated the latter in accessing talent and rights, concentrating contractual and distribution power and investment capacity in new products and services in a few operators with \"deep pocket\".","1706":"The direct and indirect network effects are linked to characteristics of digital markets which are essentially based on the sharing economy and the central power that intermediaries assume therewithin, often increased by access to interfaces \/ user receivers. The topic is particularly important for the radio and television sector for smart devices (e.g. smart speakers, smart TVs, smartphones), interfaces in connected cars;  and for search, social and cloud when they disseminate content without prior consent of the beneficiaries for adequate traceability and remuneration. A very delicate issue reates to prominence due to content produced by broadcasters; privacy and practices at the limits of legality. In the big data supply chain, the management of data of third parties appears not transparent and a critical issue.\nOn the topic of smart devices, the recent investigation by German antitrust on smart TVs (CRTV\u2019s feature), which has shown how issues relating to user consent and \"dark patterns\" in smart interfaces can constitute a violation of privacy as well as consumers' right to be informed on hidden costs they are paying for a service. \nSee above 16.4Major risks include lack of competition, less choice, growing prices (hidden costs).Mandatory rules for transparency, accountability, interoperability must be set up within the DSA in order to allow existing authorities to monitor and possibly intervene. Coordination between the existing national authorities (eg ERGA, EDBP) at European level is also necessary.","1707":"Spotify is a leading global audio streaming service offering music and other audio content such as podcasts (https:\/\/spotify.com\/).\nSpotify also offers other services addressed to artists, podcasters, publishers, and other creators, such as Spotify for Artists (https:\/\/artists.spotify.com\/), Spotify Publishing Analytics (https:\/\/publishers.spotify.com\/), Spotify for Podcasters (https:\/\/podcasters.spotify.com\/), Anchor (https:\/\/anchor.fm\/), Soundbetter (https:\/\/soundbetter.com\/) and Soundtrap (http:\/\/soundtrap\/).

Spotify's responses to this consultation focus on Spotify's experience from operating its audio streaming service.Please see response to Question 3.Spotify relies on a variety of digital services to provide its audio streaming service to users and to market its service in order to acquire additional free users and paying subscribers. In particular:\n \na. A large portion of Spotify's users use Spotify's audio streaming service on mobile devices. Therefore, Spotify relies on the services of mobile app stores (e.g., Apple's App Store, Google's Google Play Store) to distribute its app to users on mobile devices and advertise its services;\n \nb. Spotify uses integration with third-party intelligent voice assistants on smartphones\/tablets and other smart devices (e.g., smart speakers) to facilitate users' access to its audio streaming service; and\n \nc. Spotify uses third-party digital advertising services to promote its audio streaming service in order to acquire additional free users and paying subscribers.\nThe majority of the market features listed in Question 6 are well-documented in economic literature and EU precedent as being capable of contributing (alone or in combination with others) to structural competition problems.\nIn Spotify's experience, market features H, M, and N are \"very important\" contributing factors to structural competition issues, especially in markets for the distribution of mobile apps:\nH - High customer switching costs. High customer switching costs are a well-documented factor contributing to reduced intensity of competition on the market. In mobile ecosystems, the costs that users incur to switch from one mobile ecosystem to another are high, including both monetary and non-monetary costs (e.g. the need for users to download existing apps for their new smart mobile OS, to learn and become familiar with a new interface and to transfer a large amount of data through often inconvenient and imperfect tools). Switching costs are further increased by the fact that users tend to invest in multiple devices compatible with their main mobile ecosystem in addition to their smartphone (e.g., tablet, smart speakers running the same OS), which makes users invest even further in that ecosystem. High switching costs (together with brand loyalty) contribute to users being effectively locked into their current mobile ecosystem (typically either iOS or Android). As users are locked in to their respective mobile ecosystems, they are faced with a limited set of choices of app distribution channels, the range of which is largely dictated by the mobile ecosystem owner (e.g., on iOS, only one app distribution option is allowed \u2013 Apple's own App Store).\nM - Customers typically use one platform (single-homing). In Spotify's experience, mobile users tend to single-home when it comes to their (i) mobile ecosystem; and (ii) app distribution channel on their mobile ecosystem.  \n(i) High switching costs are one of the reasons for users single-homing when it comes to their mobile ecosystem.\n(ii) Single-homing in relation to app distribution channels is a by-product of users single-homing in relation to their mobile ecosystem \/ OS and the fact that app distribution options on each mobile OSs are few.  For instance, Apple allows only one app distribution channel (its own App Store) on iOS and, on Android, while there is technically more than one option for app distribution, empirical evidence shows that users rarely use technical means to by-pass the Google Play Store (e.g., side-loading) or app stores other than the Google Play store. This was supported inter alia by the empirical evidence reviewed by the Dutch competition authority in its 2019 app store study (https:\/\/www.acm.nl\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/market-study-into-mobile-app-stores.pdf). \nThe combination of high switching costs and user single-homing leads to the conclusion that app developers cannot afford to be absent from either Android or iOS if they want to gain scale. This supports a conclusion that there are separate relevant markets for app distribution on each of Android and iOS. \nN - The platform owner is competing with the business users on the platform. A platform owner that is vertically integrated and competes with business users downstream functions as both referee and player. While neither vertical integration nor competing with business users is per se anti-competitive, these market features provide platform owners with the ability and incentives to unfairly disadvantage business users to the benefit of their own vertically-related services (i.e., self-preferencing behaviour). This would result in platform owners' downstream services gaining an unmerited competitive advantage to the detriment of competition and consumers.In Spotify's experience, the following market scenarios can often arise in app distribution markets and become \"very important\" structural competition problems with detrimental effects for competition and consumers:","1708":"\u00b7  \tGatekeeper scenarios: situations where customers predominantly use one service provider\/platform (single-home) and therefore the market dynamics are controlled by the gatekeeper.\n\u00b7  \tA company with market power in a core market extends that market power to related markets.\n\u00b7  \tAnti-competitive monopolisation, where one market player may rapidly acquire market shares due to its capacity to put competitors at a disadvantage in the market unfairly.","1709":"For reasons explained in response to Question 6, platform owners hold a gatekeeper position in the app distribution value chain, which allows them to unilaterally determine the market dynamics and the conditions of competition for app developers and, ultimately, the market conditions that consumers encounter when downloading, purchasing and using apps and in-app content. ","1710":"While holding a gatekeeper position is not per se anti-competitive under EU competition law, experience in digital markets has shown that gatekeepers are often prone to abusing their power if left unscrutinised. This leads to anti-competitive scenarios where an app store owner leverages its market power in its core market (the app distribution market) to acquire market power in downstream markets for apps through means other than competition on the merits. App store owners have the ability and incentives to make app store rules a vehicle for exclusionary and exploitative behaviour against app developers and users.In addition to Spotify's experience with Apple\u2019s App Store, the number of other market players who have complained about self-preferencing behaviour by platforms with market power indicate that digital gatekeepers extending market power from a core market to adjacent markets is common.As the Commission's precedent demonstrates, leveraging market power from a core market to adjacent markets using means that do not constitute competition on the merits can have detrimental consequences for consumers and developers. In Spotify's view, these would include at least the following:","1711":"- directly harming developers by artificially and unfairly limiting their growth in terms of inter alia user acquisition in the short to medium term and as a result threatening their chances of long-term viability, as the digital economy is characterised by scale economies and network effects. These effects can occur whether the developers accept the restrictions imposed by the dominant platform, or seek to avoid them by pursuing costly and sometimes less effective alternatives.","1712":"- reducing innovation, as the leveraging company's competitors have reduced incentives and financial ability to innovate and develop new products desirable to consumers, while in some cases the platform owner is able to impose its own less effective solutions (e.g., Apple forces app developers to use its own, one-size-fits-all in-app payment solutions, while better solutions exist).\nThe most suitable intervention measures will be specific to the circumstances of each case. At a high level, the Commission's intervention should result in the leveraging company ceasing the leveraging behaviour and refraining from recreating it through other conduct. \nThe speed at which digital markets evolve is astonishing and market positions acquired through leveraging tactics can very quickly become entrenched, therefore any intervention by the Commission should, in addition to effective remedies, prioritise speed (including through the use of interim measures) to avoid serious (and often irreversible) harm to competition and consumers.\nOnce competition has been harmed, the Commission should also consider remedies designed to restore competition so that the gatekeeper is not allowed to retain the benefits from its anti-competitive actions. \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU are not always sufficiently effective in addressing leveraging practices, because:","1713":"(ii) Articles 101 and 102 TFEU might not capture instances of detrimental leveraging behaviour below the threshold of dominance (either by a single company or by multiple market participants).Spotify has experienced this behaviour in the market for app distribution on iOS devices through Apple's App Store. According to their public statements other app developers have faced similar issues.Please see response to Question 8.3 mutatis mutandis.Please see response to Question 8.5 mutatis mutandis.Please see response to Question 8.7 mutatis mutandis.Please see responses to Question 9.1 mutatis mutandis.Anti-competitive monopolisation is currently only addressable under Article 102 TFEU, which requires a finding of dominance. As a result, current ex-post competition enforcement fails to address cases of anti-competitive monopolisation by companies below the threshold of dominance.","1714":"Articles 101\/102 TFEU are unlikely to be suitable instruments to intervene early in \u2018tipping markets\u2019 because they require a finding of anti-competitive infringement, while \u2018tipping\u2019 can be the result of the economics and structure of the market. In addition, investigations based on Articles 101\/102 TFEU take a long time and their outcome may come too late, i.e. when the market has already tipped.","1715":"Tipping can sometimes be an efficient and necessary outcome for consumers arising from the economics of the market, as certain markets are natural monopolies. Therefore, the Commission should consider carefully how and whether to use the NCT to remedy \u2018tipping\u2019 situations, with the goal of intervention being to achieve the most efficient outcomes for consumers.See responses to Questions 7-9 in relation to Spotify's experience with gatekeeping behaviour in app distribution markets.","1716":"As set out in response to Question 6, in app distribution markets, a lack of user multi-homing combined with high switching costs results in user lock-in and can contribute to app store owners becoming gatekeepers. In turn, to reach these captive users and acquire scale and\/or benefit from network effects, business operators have no choice but to be present on the gatekeeper's platform and accept the gatekeeper's terms for doing so (often even against the business operator's own financial interests). ","1717":"Spotify has marked \"high number of users\" as \"important\" rather than \"very important\" to emphasise that for a platform to be a gatekeeper it does not need to have the highest user count amongst platforms of the same type (e.g. app stores); it is sufficient that it has a critical mass of users that is commercially significant for business users (e.g. developers) to reach.The three criteria listed in Question 18.9 are effectively aspects of the same competition concern: gatekeepers (e.g. app stores) are able to design the rules of the game and control access to the platform which is critical for both consumers and business users, hence acting as private regulators. The fact that both business users and consumers are forced to accept the gatekeeper's terms, while being restricted in their ability to make alternative choices, creates an environment where the gatekeeper has both the ability and the incentive to abuse its position, including by leveraging its market power into adjacent markets to the detriment of competition and consumers.The risk to competition and consumers of leaving gatekeeper power unchecked is too significant and can often become irreparable, therefore the Commission's ability to intervene is critical.Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (in particular Article 102) have, thus far, proven relatively versatile, and have allowed intervention to capture anti-competitive behaviour by specific companies arising from their gatekeeper position in order to prevent \/ remedy a worsening of competitive conditions. ","1718":"(ii) when seeking to improve (rather than simply preserve a degree of) competition, wider intervention may be required, to control behaviours by gatekeepers which may not necessarily fall within the scope of Articles 101 or 102 TFEU but are still contributing to an uneven playing field or to reduced competition.Spotify does not have sufficient relevant experience to identify specific sectors\/markets which would be particularly susceptible to structural competition problems.","1719":"Please see response to Question 24.1 below.No sufficient relevant experience or knowledge.Please see response to Question 24.1 below.No sufficient relevant experience or knowledge.Traditional ex-post competition enforcement under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (in particular under Article 102) has, thus far, proven relatively versatile, expanding to capture new theories of harm in the digital economy. Nevertheless, investigations under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU typically take several years to complete and impose remedies, thus enforcement can often come too late and be less capable of pre-empting or remedying serious (and often irreversible) harm to competition and consumers. In fast-moving digital markets, speed of enforcement is of the essence. Moreover, certain types of practices do not fall under the scope of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.\n \nIn addition, while ex-post enforcement seeks to remedy the effects of infringements of competition law by specific market players, it is often not capable of pre-empting or remedying the effects of broader market features and failures which cannot be attributed to violations of competition rules but deteriorate the competitiveness of digital markets and cause consumer harm.\n \nThe NCT could constitute a major step in the direction of filling the gaps left by traditional competition law enforcement. Ultimately, this will depend on how well the design of the NCT serves the overarching priorities of swift enforcement and effective remedies. Spotify agrees with the NCT Inception Impact Assessment, which characterises the new tool as \"one of the measures aimed at [\u2026] addressing gaps in the current EU competition rules and allowing for timely and effective intervention against structural competition problems across markets.\"A NCT that would not establish an infringement by a specific company would be better suited to preventing structural competition problems from arising. Current competition enforcement tools are already helpful in preventing a worsening of competitive conditions on the market. A NCT could complement these traditional tools by actively bolstering competition, including by preventing structural competition problems from arising in the first place. Because the NCT will not be focused on finding specific infringements of competition law, it will have the potential to review markets holistically and examine the potential anti-competitive effects of structural or behavioural characteristics of an entire market as well as the links between them. The latter are not necessarily firmly attributable to an abuse of dominance or anti-competitive agreements by specific companies but, for instance, may constitute inherent features of the market or even derive from customer behaviour (perhaps encouraged by suppliers).\n  \nThe speed of evolution of digital markets requires a proactive approach to dealing with structural competition problems, designed to promote rather than simply to preserve competition.","1720":"\nA dominance-based NCT would risk not sufficiently reinforcing the Commission's arsenal compared to ex-post enforcement under Article 102 TFEU (except potentially a small improvement in the speed of review). More specifically, the structural competition issues that the Commission aims to tackle through the NCT are much broader than merely issues stemming from single company dominance. Dominance could be one of the market features taken into account in the Commission's holistic examination of a market, but should not be the defining\/gating market feature. In addition, requiring a finding of dominance would mean that, similar to Article 102 TFEU, the NCT would also fail to capture problematic behaviour by companies which are not yet dominant, but are seeking to monopolise markets through their conduct.The scope of Spotify's business and experience is limited to the digital sector. Spotify's view is that the NCT should capture at least the digital sector (but could potentially be broader).","1721":"As noted in response to Question 28, in Spotify's view, the NCT should capture at least the digital sector. Spotify recognises the practical difficulties in trying to limit the scope of the NCT to sectors \"affected by digitisation.\" Defining the scope of the NCT as capturing \"sectors affected by digitisation\" by reference, for instance, to certain economic characteristics would be likely to cause legal uncertainty as few, if any, industries could arguably be described as not \"affected by digitisation\" and this will certainly continue to be the case in the future. As the Commission notes in the Inception Impact Assessment \"the entire economy is increasingly digitised and all sectors (from energy to media, pharma, farming, manufacturing and mobility) will become to a large extent digital in the years to come.\"Alongside timeliness of intervention, effectiveness of remedies should be a fundamental principle underpinning the NCT. Given the broad scope of the NCT, to be able to implement effective remedies the Commission would need to be armed with a wide range of remedy options that it can tailor to the identified structural competition issues. In this regard, the Commission should have:","1722":"Measures to ensure the proportionality of remedies should be a critical consideration for the Commission as, especially in the digital sphere, disproportionate remedies risk resulting in unintended distortions to market outcomes, including chilling investment and innovation.\nSee response to Question 30.1Structural remedies alter the competitive structure of the market on a lasting basis and, in most cases, cannot be reversed. They are also onerous for the parties involved, as any forced divestment is likely to be at distress prices. Therefore, in most cases, the use of structural remedies is unlikely to be the most suitable or proportionate measure to combat structural competition problems and should only be imposed either where there is no equally effective behavioural remedy or where any equally effective behavioural remedy would be more burdensome.","1723":"To review the competitiveness of an entire sector\/market the Commission would need to be armed with a wide range of investigative tools (as wide as the range of tools available for competition law investigations under Article 101 and 102 TFEU).Please see response to Question 33.1The features of the NCT as currently set out in the Commission's Inception Impact Assessment do not inherently guarantee faster intervention compared to traditional competition law investigations. ","1724":"Conducting a thorough investigation of an entire market to understand the causes of structural issues and constructing appropriate remedies may be an elaborate process that takes time. There is, therefore, a need for targeted measures aimed at ensuring speed and effectiveness of the NCT process. Such measures could include statutory time limits for the completion of each major step of a NCT market investigation (with very limited options for extensions). Nevertheless, time limits alone are not sufficient to meet the need for speed in the digital economy and may need to be combined with other measures to further expedite intervention in digital markets.Interim measures are a powerful tool that is particularly relevant in the fast-moving digital economy. The Commission could be granted the power to impose legally binding remedies on an interim basis, during the course of an NCT investigation and pending its outcome, to pre-empt irreparable (or even very serious) harm to competition. One way to ensure that the Commission is actively considering whether the use of interim measures is appropriate would be to set a specific timeframe in the life of an NCT investigation (after key investigative steps have been taken) by which the Commission would be required to confirm whether it thinks that interim measures are appropriate.","1725":"The Commission should allow the market to express its views on the Commission's findings, but this should be done in a structured way at prescribed points during the Commission's investigation in order to avoid the expression of such views becoming an impediment to the swift progress of the proceedings.If the NCT ultimately grants the Commission wide intervention powers (including a wide range of potential remedies), these remedies will have a considerable commercial impact not just on the companies concerned, but also on the wider sector\/market. It is therefore important to allow market participants to express their views on the appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies to ensure that the Commission has properly taken into account market reality in designing its remedies.

The share of duty-free imports has increased in \nperiods in which imports  are  sensibly lower  in quantity, such as during  the  economic  crisis.  Among \ncountries subject to the tariff, Russia accounts for slightly less than 38% of the EU\u2019s total imports of \nunwrought, not alloyed, aluminium, also representing about 63% of the total imports subject to the tariff. \nConversely, Mozambique (17%) and Iceland (16%) are the main exporters among duty-free countries.

In  the  period  2000-2017,  the  inward  processing  procedure  was  extensively  used  by  EU \ncompanies both for not alloyed aluminium (averaging 43% of the total import subject to duties) and \naluminium alloys (averaging 39% of the total import subject to duties). ","1757":"The adoption of import tariffs is meant to increase prices of both imported and domestic goods. Given \nthe regional market conditions and the structural characteristics of the EU aluminium industry, there is \nan incentive for domestic producers of unwrought aluminium, including those with duty-free access to \nthe EU internal market, to align their prices with the highest possible level, namely the duty-paid price. \nThis theoretical prediction is largely confirmed by findings of many studies focusing on the aluminium \nindustry. ","1758":"As such, they correspond to extra revenues for primary and secondary producers (in addition to revenue \nfor EU customs). EU primary and secondary aluminium producers should in principle use the additional \nrevenues to compensate for cost differences with respect to extra-EU competitors as well as to invest in \nimproving their products and production technologies. Moreover, as a result of current PTAs, extra costs \nfor  EU  downstream  transformers  also  represent  additional  revenues  for  primary  producers  based  in \ncountries from which primary aluminium can be imported on a duty-free basis (mainly Norway, Iceland, \nand Mozambique).  ","1759":"Increasing international competition from developing countries and limited bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis \ntheir customers have mostly prevented EU downstream transformers from further passing through the \nextra costs imposed by import tariffs down the value chain, thus progressively squeezing their margins \nand putting  further pressure  on  their  survival,  in  particular  on  SMEs.  Whenever  partial  or full pass-\nthrough is possible, import tariffs  would still result  in  higher  prices of semi-finished  products to the \ndetriment of EU end-user industries and final consumers.

Those  additional  expenses \nrepresent up to 75% of the turnover of the European downstream aluminium industry in 2015. This also \nimplies yearly average extra costs ranging between \u20ac529 million and \u20ac1 billion. ","1761":"The largest share of the extra costs translated into extra revenues for remelters and refiners based in the \nEU producing secondary aluminium (33% of total extra costs). The price increase due to the EU import \ntariffs also led to extra revenues for EU smelters (28% of total extra costs) and for primary producers \nbased in countries from which primary aluminium can be imported on a duty-free basis (26% of total \nextra costs). ","1762":"At the EU level, the task of supporting the aluminium industry was mainly left to trade rules, including \nthe use of import tariffs as the main industrial policy measure. National measures were primarily aimed \nat  sustaining  existing  upstream  activities  by  lowering  their  energy  costs,  often  as  a  part  of  a  wider ","1763":"The import tariffs on unwrought aluminium were mainly justified by the need to prevent EU smelters \nfrom  reducing  their  production  or  even  shutting  down  their  facilities,  eventually  moving  them  to \ncountries with low energy and labour costs, as well as lax environmental regulations. In turn, this would \nmake more difficult for EU producers of semi-finished products and end-user industries to reliably and \ncompetitively source unwrought aluminium and aluminium products. ","1764":"The  EU\u2019s  production  of  primary  aluminium  has  decreased  significantly  because  of  the  major \ncurtailments and shutdown of numerous EU smelters. More than 11,300 jobs were lost in the upstream \nsegment, including in the alumina and metal supply sectors, in the period 2002-2015. Consequently, the \nEU  trade  deficit  regarding  unwrought  aluminium  has  considerably  worsened  and  will  be  further \nexacerbated with the closure of additional smelters. ","1765":"In 2017, the EU\u2019s primary aluminium production was about 27% of the EU\u2019s apparent consumption of \nprimary aluminium. Furthermore, in the same year, as a consequence of several smelter closures, the \ntotal installed smelting capacity in the EU was instead equal to 30% of the EU\u2019s apparent consumption \nof primary aluminium. The increasing demand for primary aluminium has been met by rising imports. \nDependence  on  imported  unwrought  aluminium  for  the  production  of  aluminium  semi-finished  and \nfinished products has thus steadily increased. ","1766":"No increases in production capacity or new entries in the unwrought aluminium segment are expected \nin  the  EU  member  states  in  the  next  few  years.  This  will  further  increase  the  EU\u2019s  dependence  on \nimports, as unwrought aluminium consumption is expected to grow, though at a slower pace than in the \npast. ","1767":"An effective protection of segments further down the value chain would necessitate sourcing unwrought \naluminium at the lowest possible costs, leaving aside any issues related to security and continuity of \nsupply.  The  adoption  of  import  tariffs  works  exactly  in  the  opposite  direction  by  potentially \ncounteracting the effects of trade measures in downstream segments (i.e. import tariffs on semi-finished \nproducts). Not surprisingly, many countries such as China have adopted policies to make unwrought \naluminium cheaper as to explicitly confer a cost advantage on domestic manufacturers of semis. ","1768":"The overall effects are clearly visible. In 2017, EU production of aluminium extrusions was slightly \nbelow  2000  levels,  although  global  production  has  tripled  in  the  same  period.

In  the  period  2000-2017,  the  EU\u2019s  trade  balance  has constantly  worsened  in  all \nsectors of aluminium semi-finished products, as consumption of semi-finished aluminium products has \nincreased at a compound growth annual rate of 3% in the same period. ","1769":"The  competitive  advantage  of  the  EU  aluminium  value  chain  undoubtedly  lies  in  the  technological \nleadership of the downstream activities. From a broader industrial policy perspective, it is thus essential \nto  provide  all  the  right  support  to  maintain  this  leadership  and  possibly  reinforce  the  economic  and \nindustrial competitiveness of firms producing semi-finished products and using aluminium products.

However, according to the Roadmap, the aim is not precisely to eliminate distortions \nof  competition,  but  to  eliminate  so-called  structural  risks  and  deficits  below  the  radar  of \ncompetition law. Nor would the information and disclosure obligations for companies to \"identify\" \nrisks, which the NCT would certainly entail, be covered by Article 114 TFEU, as the discussion on \nthe establishment of a Single Market Information Instrument (SMIT) a few years ago showed.

We agree, that in specific cases, these situations may give rise to competition concerns, especially \nwhere  entry  barriers,  of  a  regulatory  or  non-regulatory  nature,  in  a  given  market  could  limit \ncompetition  from  existing  players  and\/or  limit  new  entrants  into  the  market.  However,  we \nwonder whether markets tipping, dominance or network effects in themselves always require \ncompetition enforcement action. These can be a normal result of successful growth strategies \nand scale efficiencies and can generate economic and consumer benefits. They may however give \nrise to concerns where they lead to restrictions of competition and limit entry into a given market. ","1779":"6.  The Commission already has powers to conduct sector inquiries and take follow up action where \nsuch concerns arise. As we have seen in many instances in the past, a sector inquiry constitutes \nan effective and proportionate tool to identify structural competition problems and their possible \nharm to competition and consumer welfare; they provide the basis for the Commission to take \naction as required (e.g. recommendations, enforcement action, legislation). We therefore ask the \nCommission to focus on the effects on competition and consumer welfare rather than on market \nstructures  themselves  and  provide for  these  to be  assessed  individually  on  their  merits  and \neffects.

Providers  compete  on  price,  quality  of  service  and \ninnovation and consumers shop around for the deal that they consider the most attractive.  There \nmay be some exceptions where there are strong network effects (such as online search addressed \nin the Google Shopping case) and where it is harder for smaller rivals to compete because the \nservice is offered free of charge to consumers and is monetised through ads.

In addition, European Courts have previously confirmed that the list of abuses in Article 102 of the EU Treaty is non-exhaustive, so that indeed also cases of atypical conduct can eventually be covered if it leads to evident anti-competitive effects. Where leveraging strategies are preceded by the acquisition of a company active in a neighbouring market, the Commission in addition has the possibility to prevent potential harm at an early stage through a thorough vertical and\/or conglomerate effects analysis under the EU Merger Regulation.

In Laurent Piau v. Commission (Case T-193\/02), the General Court has expressly stated that collective dominance under Article 102 of the EU Treaty covers oligopolistic tacit collusion. It is mostly due to the Commission's own enforcement priorities that Article 102 of the EU Treaty has so far never been used as a legal basis to combat tacit collusion. So far, it appears, the Commission has been successful in preventing the apparition of tacit collusion by proactive merger control enforcement (through the application of the Airtours criteria developed by the EU Courts), preventing the emergence of tight oligopolies from the outset and thus not requiring any ex post intervention. In addition to this ex ante enforcement system under the EU Merger Regulation and Article 102 of the EU Treaty, the Commission would have the possibility to test potentially disrupted markets in the context of sector inquiries, or by revoking the benefit of the Block Exemption Regulations, if the exempted conduct would prove to lead to collision among suppliers.

Where the use of pricing algorithms leads to anti-competitive effects in a market, this necessitates underlying anti-competitive conduct of one or more undertakings, which will be covered by Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty. Absent such conduct, the use of algorithms in itself is not - and cannot be - problematic and therefore does not require further intervention by the Commission.Please see our response to question 15.1 above. Where the use of pricing algorithms leads to anti-competitive effects in a market, this necessitates underlying anti-competitive conduct of one or more undertakings, which will be covered by Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty. Absent such conduct, the use of algorithms in itself is not - and cannot be - problematic and therefore does not require further intervention by the Commission.While we do not have any particular example, we believe that \"tipping\" may be particularly relevant in relation to gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms, as they may use the combination of services, product and content offers as well as the data they are able to leverage from such activities in order to attract more users and customers, which in turn will allow them to collect better data and attract even more users and customers. If aggravated by network or lock-in effects, this may lead to \"monopoly-like\" market conditions in the long term.Network effects are a key economic and strategic phenomenon in modern industries. While direct network effects occur when the value of a product or service increases exponentially with the number of other users using the same product or service (i.e. scale), indirect network effects come into play when the value of a product or service increases due to complementary products or services that add up to the business. Both types of network effects can, but do not necessarily, lead to market tipping, unless they outweigh customers\u2019 benefits from differentiation and are accompanied by high switching and multi-homing costs. If one of these conditions is not met, multiple players may coexist without market tipping even if the market is subject to strong network effects. However, if consumers have a strong single-homing preference and there are high barriers to entry, in particular direct network effects will result in the abovementioned spiral effect, allowing the prevalent player to constantly grow and push its own growth in order to eliminate other market players. This can be particularly the case in the context of by gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms that hold a strategic position along the value chain between suppliers and their consumers and are an important route for suppliers to consumer-facing markets, and may therefore be able to set the rules for access to such markets or interaction with customers.As explained above, only in the context of by gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms that hold a strategic position along the value chain between suppliers and their consumers and where markets are characterized by the presence of strong direct network effects coupled with high switching and multi-homing costs (or a disinterest of customers to engage in multi-homing) they will eventually tip in favour of one supplier emerging as the single dominant player. This is not the case for digital sectors\/markets in general, as many of them are either characterized by a high degree of multi-homing or by low switching costs, in which case multiple suppliers will be able to coexist, often with fluctuating market shares. As explained above, one example of markets in which tipping may occur are gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms, as they may use the combination of services, product and content offers as well as the data they are able to leverage from such activities in order to attract more users and customers, which in turn will allow them to collect better data and attract even more users and customers. If aggravated by network or lock-in effects, this may lead to \"monopoly-like\" market conditions in the long term.When markets tip, this is not a guarantee of permanent success. The \"tip\" can collapse due to external and internal shocks, the introduction of new technologies, substitution, product failures or changes in the product offering that will eventually start to interfere with the customers' willingness to continue using the suppliers offering. While the abovementioned concerns can, therefore, arise in tipping markets, this is not necessarily always the case, and these effects can likewise arise in markets that do not show \"tipping\".As explained in our response to Question 16.8 above, when markets tip, this is not a guarantee of permanent success. The \"tip\" can collapse due to external and internal shocks, the introduction of new technologies, substitution, product failures or changes in the product offering that will eventually start to interfere with the customers' willingness to continue using the suppliers offering. Early intervention trying to prevent the future emergence of market tipping may reduce the companies\u2019 incentives to innovate and invest in the development of their products and services, with potentially worse effects on competition than a market that is tipping in the interim. The Commission would need to be in a position to single out those markets in which tipping will result in long-lasting problems, in order to justify the degree of intervention that would be required to prevent the market from tipping. In particular in the digital field, where success of companies is largely dependent on innovations and development, the risk of foregoing the benefits that could lawfully be achieved may ultimately rather chill competition, by removing other player's incentives to challenge the then market leader.","1817":"Instead of introducing a tool such as the new competition tool that would allow for (too) early intervention in tipping markets, we would suggest to rely on ex ante regulation such as the rules proposed in the context of the Digital Service Act, that does not preclude the application of the competition rules if regulatory obligations are not respected. Where a market has tipped and this leads to anti-competitive behaviour of the market leader, this would in any case be covered by Article 102 of the EU Treaty.As explained above, we are of the view that, at the very least, too early intervention in tipping markets should be avoided as this could lead to adverse effects on the companies' incentives to innovate in markets where this is not required. There is a high risk of unintended consequences, leading to higher prices, lower quality of product offering, reduction of choice for consumers, etc.   Unnecessary enforcement and regulation in tipping markets could hinder business, reduce pro-competitive business activities and innovation.  Competition law intervention to try to prevent the emergence of future market players with some sort of entrenched or gatekeeper function will potentially change incentives and deter disruptive innovation. Instead of introducing a tool such as the new competition tool that would allow for (too early) intervention in tipping markets, we would suggest to rely on ex ante regulation such as the rules proposed in the context of the Digital Service Act, that does not preclude the application of the competition rules if regulatory obligations are not respected. As already outlined above, we could support the idea of creating rules specifically addressing the issue of gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms as suggested under the contemplated Digital Services Act. However, the rules should be limited to what is necessary to address the actual problems that have been identified, i.e. clearly limit the scope of application in terms of defining the subject and problematic conduct addressed. In addition, they would need to be aligned with the existing competition law framework of Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty and the accompanying guidelines. A continued flexible approach to allowing brand owners to restrict resellers from selling on third-party platforms, for instance, could limit the instances in which gatekeepers \/ platforms obtain data regarding the sale of such products, which in turn limits the circumstances in which gatekeeper \/ systemic roles emerge in the first place. .","1818":"Where a market has tipped and this leads to anti-competitive behaviour of the market leader, this would in any case be covered by Article 102 of the EU Treaty. Article 102 of the EU Treaty offers a number of legal bases for proscribing such behaviour, notably: abusive discrimination, tying and bundling, refusal to supply or imposing of unfair trading practices. This catalogue has traditionally been interpreted broadly to cover a wide range of conduct including leveraging strategies. In addition, the Court has previously confirmed that the list of abuses in Article 102 of the EU Treaty is non-exhaustive, so that indeed also cases of atypical conduct can eventually be covered if it leads to evident anti-competitive effects.","1819":"We have answered \u2018yes\u2019 as we believe certain potential practices by gatekeeper or systemic platforms should be addressed, in particular if they fall into the scope of Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty. At the same time, we believe that intervention needs to be careful, as not all conduct by every gatekeeper \/ systemic platform will always be anti-competitive. In particular where issues arise that cannot be covered by the existing legal framework due to lack of anti-competitive conduct or lack of dominance, intrusive intervention trying to sanction a gatekeeper that has lawfully engaged in developing its business model may have detrimental effects on competition and the company's willingness to act as a \"gate provider\" in the first place. In particular too early intervention, trying to prevent the future emergence of market tipping may reduce companies\u2019 incentives to innovate and invest in the development of their products and services, with potentially worse effects on competition than a market that is tipping in the interim.We believe that Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are generally suited to address competition law issues in digital markets, including potential issues arising in the context of gatekeeper platforms. Article 102 of the EU Treaty includes a broad catalogue of practices that can be considered abusive, if they are carried out by a dominant player with negative effects on competition. If its application is excluded because an undertaking cannot be found to be dominant in a given market, but yet negative effects on competition can be identified, this may not necessarily be indicative for a gap case.

Any additional powers to be granted to the Commission in order to intervene in gatekeeper scenarios would therefore need to specifically address the issues identified, including the underlying competition theory of harm and be aligned with the existing competition law framework in Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty. ","1821":"We acknowledge the Commission's view that in particular scenarios, additional regulatory safeguards for the specific identified issue of gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms could be useful in order to prevent them from abusing their strategic position along the value chain between suppliers and their consumers to the detriment of other market participants (and ultimately consumers).

While we are therefore objecting to the idea of implementing a tool as broad as the new competition tool, we could support the idea of creating rules specifically addressing the issue of gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms as suggested under the contemplated Digital Services Act. This would also allow the Commission to address the manifold issues that can arise in the context of gatekeeper platforms in a tailored and structured way. However, the rules should be limited to what is necessary to address the actual problems that have been identified, i.e. clearly limit the scope of application in terms of defining the subject and problematic conduct addressed.

Instead of adding a new intervention mechanism, the Commission should improve the way in which it uses its current powers, e.g. by making more use of its rarely used \"soft\" investigation tools such as sector inquiries or invitations for companies to request formal or informal guidance letters (as foreseen in its Informal Guidance Notice).","1823":"Only where particular issues arise due to markets becoming incontestable as a result of them tipping in favour of one single supplier and this cannot be addressed with the tools under the existing legal framework, additional regulatory safeguards may be worth considering. However, as explained above, we believe that this will only be the case for the specific issue of gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms and such issues should be addressed with specific rules targeted at the theories of harm identified, instead of a broad tool aiming at covering markets with certain features that may potentially lead to structural problems.Article 101 of the EU Treaty gives the Commission the power to intervene in any scenario, including such potentially involving structural competition problems, where harm to competition results from anticompetitive agreements, concerted practices or decisions by associations of undertakings. These being the only requirements, Article 101 of the EU Treaty is suited to address all kinds of issues resulting from the interplay of two undertakings, including novel issues in digital markets. By way of example, we believe that Article 101 of the EU Treaty is well-designed to deal with the issue of tacit collusion through the use of algorithms, as already explained above. To the extent that the operation of the algorithms is set up in a way to align the companies' pricing strategies, there will usually be an anti-competitive agreement at the outset, with the consequence that Article 101 of the EU Treaty becomes applicable. However, Article 101 (3) of the EU Treaty is likewise suited to take into account that algorithms often provide significant efficiencies, so that agreements on the use of algorithms between competitors can be exempted if they ultimately result in efficiencies that are passed on to consumers.","1824":"Article 102 of the EU Treaty gives the Commission the power to intervene in a broad (non-exhaustive) catalogue of practices that can be considered abusive, if they are carried out by a dominant player with negative effects on competition.

","1825":"Obviously, Article 102 of the EU Treaty cannot cover allegedly problematic unilateral practices of undertakings below the dominance threshold. In many cases, however, this may not necessarily be indicative of a gap case. As recent cases have shown, Article 102 of the EU Treaty can be very well interpreted in a way that allows for its application also in \"novel\" types of conduct in digital markets. Rather than introducing additional mechanisms, the Commission should build on its current enforcement powers and enhance their application by making them more dynamic, forward-looking and at the same time pragmatic, e.g. by issuing additional guidance papers or by making increased use of formal and informal guidance letters. In particular the latter is a tool which is merely used but could be useful to solve structural competition issues in cooperation with undertakings. In addition, the Commission has the possibility to revoke benefits of Block Exemptions, such as e.g. the VBER.","1826":"We acknowledge the Commission's view that in particular scenarios, additional regulatory safeguards for the specific identified issue of gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms could be useful in order to prevent them from abusing their strategic position along the value chain between suppliers and their consumers to the detriment of other market participants (and ultimately consumers).

A continued flexible approach to allowing brand owners to restrict resellers from selling on third-party platforms, for instance, could limit the instances in which gatekeepers \/ platforms obtain data regarding the sale of such products, which in turn limits the circumstances in which gatekeeper \/ systemic roles emerge in the first place.As indicated throughout our response, while we believe that markets in which structural competition law issues arise may indeed show some of the market features\/elements listed in this consultation, we do not believe that vice versa, the presence of any of these market features or elements will necessarily be indicative (or even the source) of structural issues in a market. Whether or not a market is indeed subject to a structural competition law issue, in our view, needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the particular characteristics of the market in question. A \"Tipping\" is a particular issue that will usually arise in digital gatekeeper \/ systemic platform markets with strong direct network effects, high switching costs and\/or resistance of customers to switch and high barriers to entry. However, this should not be understood as meaning that a far-reaching additional intervention tool is required in order for the Commission to address structural problems in different sectors\/markets in general and in the digital field in particular. On the contrary, we believe that existing competition rules are sufficiently flexible to cover most structural competition problems that the Commission aims to address with its new competition tool proposal. Only where specific issues arise as a result of the particular role of gatekeeper \/ systematic platforms, ex ante regulation such as the rules suggested as part of the Digital Services Act could be useful in order to prevent such players from abusing their strategic position in the market. However, as already set out above, the rules should be limited to what is necessary to address the actual problems that have been identified, i.e. clearly limit the scope of application in terms of defining the subject and problematic conduct addressed. In addition, they would need to be aligned with the existing competition law framework of Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty and the accompanying guidelines.

In addition, instead of adding a new intervention mechanism, the Commission should improve the way in which it uses its current powers, e.g. by updating existing or issuing additional guidelines, by making more use of its rarely used \"soft\" investigation tools such as sector inquiries or by encouraging companies to request formal or informal guidance letters.We wonder if there is an adequate legal basis for the Commission to adopt the new competition tool as currently suggested. Being an ex-ante intervention tool not linked to anti-competitive conduct of undertakings, the new competition tool cannot be considered as intended to give effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and therefore cannot be based on Article 103. We also do not believe that the new competition tool could be justified by a need for harmonization as required by Article 114 of the EU Treaty.  \nThere is no need for a new competition tool. Over 50 years, Articles 101 and 102 have proven to stand longevity in safeguarding competition. Where markets are suspected of not working well due to structural issues, the Commission and national authorities have conducted investigations based on Articles 101 and 102. Authorities can also revoke benefits of Block Exemptions or carry out sector inquiries. The existing rules are therefore suitable and effective to address competition problems. It should carefully be considered whether an entirely new enforcement mechanism, envisaging a significant expansion of the Commission's powers, is what is required to enhance and streamline competition law enforcement. \nSecondly, we understand that the idea of a new competition tool is based on the challenges posed by Big Tech, digital markets and the incontestability due to tipping of such markets. While we acknowledge such cases can be complex and may involve seemingly novel issues requiring careful consideration, we believe that Articles 101 and 102 are generally suited to address competition law issues in digital markets. This is shown by Article 102 enforcement cases, as well as many national investigations. Article 102 includes a broad (non-exhaustive) catalogue of practices that can be considered abusive. If its application is excluded because an undertaking cannot be found to be dominant in a given market, but yet negative effects on competition can be identified, this may not necessarily be indicative for a gap case. Rather than introducing additional mechanisms, the Commission should build on its current enforcement powers and enhance their application by making them more dynamic, forward-looking and at the same time pragmatic. \nWhere issues arise that cannot be covered by the existing legal framework, we believe that intervention must be very careful. Intrusive intervention trying to \"break back up\" the market structure at the detriment of a market player that has lawfully engaged in developing its business model may have detrimental effects on incentives to innovate and thereby chill competition. \nWe acknowledge the Commission's view that in particular scenarios, additional regulatory safeguards for the specific identified issue of gatekeeper \/ systemic platforms could be useful. The new competition tool options, however, have a much broader perspective while not clearly setting out the theories of harm that need to be addressed. In aA broad ex ante intervention tool that allows the Commission to investigate and impose behavioural and\/or structural remedies on businesses with market power without any prior finding of a competition law infringement would undermine both this underlying objective, as enshrined in the framework set by Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty and their interpretation through the EU Courts. The Commission would risk turning from an external rule-maker and referee into a player on the field, randomly knocking out front-runners. ","1827":"The new competition tool may also wrongfully shift the focus from ex post sanctioning of wrongful behaviour to a premature sanctioning of success that may be solely based on a company's lawful efforts. It would thereby hamper the incentives of undertakings to invest in organic growth through innovation and internal development, as this may risk becoming subject to intervention without the investment bringing about the desired returns. In addition, it may threaten to undermine the legal certainty granted by the EU merger control regime and thus disincentivize growth through mergers and acquisitions, as there would remain a constant threat of potential remedies despite having received (unconditional) clearance earlier on. ","1828":"Competition thrives in diversity and distinction whereby the actors on the markets must seek to provide the European consumers with relevant and innovative products and services. That will include winners and losers. Including objectives to tackle negative societal economic effects would have a high potential of slowing the innovative nature of Europe. In particular in the digital field, where success of companies is largely dependent on innovations and development, the risk of foregoing the benefits that could lawfully be achieved may ultimately rather chill competition, by removing other player's incentives to challenge the then market leader. This would eventually force (not only digital) innovation to be moved out of Europe, ultimately weakening and distorting the EU's competitiveness in the global marketplace.As indicated above, we believe that there is no need for the new competition tool. Should it nevertheless be adopted, its scope should be limited to specifically address only such gap cases that cannot sufficiently and satisfactorily be covered by the current competition law framework, i.e. such cases in which large digital platforms act as gatekeepers and abuse their position in a way that is harmful for competition but cannot be covered by Articles 101 or 102 of the EU Treaty. As explained in our response to Question 25.1 above, a broad ex ante intervention tool that allows the Commission to investigate and impose behavioural and\/or structural remedies on businesses with market power without any prior finding of a competition law infringement would undermine both this underlying objective, as enshrined in the framework set by Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty and their interpretation through the EU Courts.","1829":"As indicated above, we believe that there is no need for the new competition tool.

The Commission is already now in a position to make non-binding recommendations to companies, e.g. by issuing additional guidance papers or by making increased use of formal and informal guidance letters. In particular the latter are a tool which is merely used but could be useful to solve structural competition issues in cooperation with undertakings. In addition, the Commission can already now make recommendations to sectorial regulators, such as in the pharmaceuticals, telecoms, electronic communications, financial services or energy sectors.We do not consider remedies addressed to particular companies as a useful tool for the issues the Commission aims to address with the New Competition Tool. Where particular issues arise due to markets becoming incontestable as a result of them tipping in favour of one single supplier, and this cannot be covered by the existing legal framework due to lack of anti-competitive conduct or lack of dominance, we believe that intervention must be very careful. Intrusive intervention trying to \"break back up\" the market structure at the detriment of a market player that has lawfully engaged in developing its business model may have detrimental effects on incentives to innovate and thereby chill competition, in particular in markets such as tech and digital which heavily rely on innovation competition. The result may ultimately be an undesirable one, where the \"tip\" of the market has eventually been cut off, but the market is no longer growing or moving.In general, and as recognized by the Commission in its Notice on remedies acceptable under Council Regulation (EC) No 139\/2004 and under Commission Regulation (EC) No 802\/2004 (\"Merger Remedies Guidance\")) with reference to the case-law of the Court, commitments which are structural in nature, such as the commitment to sell a business unit, are, as a rule, preferable to prevent undesired effects on the market structure, inasmuch as such commitments are suitable to address the competition concerns. Nevertheless, the question of whether a remedy and, more specifically, which type of remedy is suitable to eliminate the competition concerns identified, has to be examined on a case-by-case basis. In such cases that the Commission aims to address with the new competition tool, the use of structural remedies should be very careful, in particular where they cannot be covered by the existing legal framework due to a lack of anti-competitive behaviour. As explained above in our response to question 31.1, intrusive (structural) intervention trying to \"break back up\" the market structure at the detriment of a market player that has lawfully engaged in developing its business model may have detrimental effects on incentives to innovate and thereby chill competition, in particular in markets such as tech and digital which heavily rely on innovation competition. The result may ultimately be an undesirable one, where the \"tip\" of the market has eventually been cut off, but the market is no longer growing or moving.","1832":"We maintain that there is no need for the new competition tool, in particular if additional rules for the specific issue of \"gatekeeper\" platforms were to be created as suggested under the contemplated Digital Services Act. Should the new competition tool nevertheless be introduced, it would make most sense for DG Competition within the European Commission to regulate, as it in essence concerns the application of competition rules. DG Competition could set up a separate unit with sufficient competition law, economic and technology experts. This would also ensure a coherent application of the rules throughout Europe\u2019s Digital Single Market and no legal uncertainty due to national interpretations. The decisions by DG Competition should be subject to review by the General Court and the European Court of Justice.We maintain that there is no need for the new competition tool. In case it nevertheless were to be introduced, we would believe that out of the investigative powers described above, market investigations similar to those foreseen in EU merger control proceedings and\/or sector inquiries, i.e. requests for information issued to different market participants, would be the most - and only - appropriate means to ensure the effectiveness of a new tool. However, given that such requests are often very comprehensive, in particular if there are several or repeated requests in a very short time frame with tight deadlines, we would suggest not making the response to such requests mandatory, in particular not to impose any penalties in case companies do not provide information at all and\/or in a timely manner. We believe that if a tool such as the new competition tool were to be adopted, it should be based more on cooperative intelligence than on investigations of a criminal nature. In cases where there is indeed a serious structural market problem, it will be in the market participants' own interest to participate in the survey. For the same reasons, we do not believe that investigative powers similar to those applied in investigations in the context of Articles 101 or 102 of the EU Treaty should be introduced. Unlike in cases of anti-competitive agreements or abuses of dominance, in the scenarios that the Commission aims to cover with the new competition tool there will mostly be no deliberate wrongdoing of an undertaking, but it would be the market characteristics in itself that would cause the issues in question. In such a constellation, it would be inappropriate and disproportionate to carry out investigative measures with the character of criminal prosecution. For completeness, any investigative powers of a mandatory nature that could possibly infringe an undertakings rights would need to be subject to review by the EU Courts.If the new competition tool were to be introduced, deadlines with regard to the temporal scope of the investigations would be crucial to avoid overly lengthy proceedings and to create certainty for the undertakings involved. Otherwise, there would be a substantial demand for additional time and resources, which may adversely affect the effectiveness of the new tool (in particular in fast-moving digital markets). At the same time, any investigative measures introduced should give market participants sufficient time to provide informed intelligence, in particular with a view to the potential issuing of requests for information, which can be very comprehensive and thus cumbersome for undertakings to complete during the ordinary course of business. In addition, the contemplated procedures may be too time-consuming, in particular with a view to the necessary procedural safeguards that would be required, to produce results in a timeframe that is sufficiently short to account for the fast-moving nature of digital markets. In its contemplated form, the new competition tool may therefore unnecessarily constrain the Commission's resources without ultimately having the desired outcome.Interim measures can be a useful tool to prevent irreparable harm to competition in cases of suspected infringements of Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty, i.e. such arising from particular allegedly unlawful conduct of one or more undertakings. However, as already explained above in response to question 33.3, unlike in cases related to wrongful conduct, the scenarios that the Commission aims to cover with the new competition tool will in most cases not involve deliberate wrongdoing of one or more undertakings - the issues will rather evolve from the market conditions more generally. It would therefore, in our view, be very difficult to impose on particular market participants interim measures that are at the same time effective and proportionate. Measures addressing potential structural problems that would fall under the scope of the new competition tool would have to be far-reaching and could therefore risk further chilling of competition in a market even when it is not clear yet whether further intervention may be required. Where an issue was to be so self-evident that it would call for specific interim measures to be adopted, we believe that this would be better addressed by a separate procedure outside of the application of any new competition tool. In any case, the Commission would have to prove that the specific behaviour of the undertaking(s) in question is the underlying reason for the structural issues in question, as otherwise evidentiary standards of proof would be violated, and measures would risk being arbitrary. This, in turn, would ultimately risk adverse effects and may be more harmful than the actual structural issue in question. For the avoidance of doubt, if the possibility of imposing interim measures were to be included in a new competition tool, this would also have to be in line with the use of interim measures in the context of Article 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty, in particular it would have to be subject to strict legal supervision and be challengeable, in an appropriate timeframe to prevent harm arising from unjustified measures, before the EU Courts.As explained in our response to question 33.3 above, we believe that if a tool such as the new competition tool were to be adopted, it should be based more on cooperative intelligence than on investigations of a criminal nature. In cases where there is indeed a serious structural market problem, it will be in the market participants' own interest to participate in the intelligence gathering process and to suggest measures on how to improve the market structure. If the issue in question could be addressed by suitable voluntary commitments offered by the undertakings concerned, we do not see why this possibility should not be accepted.The possibility for the targeted companies to be heard and to express their comments on any findings of competition law issues affecting them would be essential to the lawfulness of any additional intervention mechanism to be adopted. We believe it would be crucial to have a continuous dialogue between DG Competition and the companies affected to make sure any measures taken are appropriate and effective and to exclude any adverse effects on competition in the market in question.As explained in the response to question 37.1 above, the possibility for the targeted companies to be heard and to express their comments on any findings of competition law issues affecting them would be essential to the lawfulness of any additional intervention mechanism to be adopted. This applies all the more in case remedies were to be considered to address structural concerns in the market that may potentially substantially affect companies\u2019 business activities.Any new intervention mechanism adopted would have to be subject to full judicial review in order to ensure that the procedural and essential rights of undertakings are respected. On the procedural side, this would involve the right of any market participant to challenge measures taken by the Commission (including preparatory acts during the investigation phase), both before the ombudsman and before the EU Courts, while on the substantive side, it should provide for a full review of the assessment as well as the underlying facts and evidence to prevent potentially severe adverse effects on competition and\/or particular market participants as a result of deficits in the investigation.The current rules have generally proven to be sufficient in safeguarding competition. Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty (as well as their national equivalents) are suitable and sufficiently effective to address most competition problems, even in relation to digital markets. Specific issues arising as a result of systemic platforms and their particular function in the market, which cannot otherwise be addressed on the basis of Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty, would be best addressed through additional regulatory rules (e.g. Digital Services Act). However, the rules should be limited to what is necessary to address the actual problems that have been identified. In addition, they would need to be aligned with the existing competition law framework of Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty and the accompanying guidelines, to make sure that there is no overlap and the same legal standards continue to be applied. A continued flexible approach to allowing brand owners to restrict resellers from selling on third-party platforms, for instance, could limit the instances in which gatekeepers \/ platforms obtain data regarding the sale of such products, which in turn limits the circumstances in which gatekeeper \/ systemic roles emerge in the first place.","1833":"If this is achieved under the Digital Services Act, there is no further need for a new competition tool.

In addition, as recently acknowledged by the CMA in relation to its probe of digital advertisement, a market investigation tool would also not be the adequate means to address the issues in digital markets that the Commission primarily intends to address with the new competition tool. The required procedures would simply be too time-consuming to produce results in a timeframe that is sufficiently short to account for the fast-moving nature of digital markets.

Tackling  these  risks  will  require  measures  that  increase  transparency \nabout  how  platforms  moderate  content.  Content  moderation  is  a  standard  practice  among \nplatforms  and  is  usually  achieved  via  automated  decision-making  (ADM)  tools  because  the  sheer \nabundance of information is impossible for human agents alone to process. Using ADM, platforms \ncan  identify,  filter  or  remove  illegal  content  that  may  fall  under  a  certain  category  (e.g.  terrorist, \nchild sexual abuse, racist and xenophobic hate speech). ","1837":"No  matter  how  beneficial this  practice  may  sound,  it  poses  serious  threats  to  fundamental  rights, \nsuch  as  freedom  of  expression  and  opinion.  ADM  tools  are  unable  to  understand  the  highly \ncontextual and delicate nuances of speech. While ADM can potentially identify illegal content, it can \nalso silence groups and individuals whose messages are not illegal. As a result, ADM can reinforce \nsocial biases, for example, by targeting the content of minorities and vulnerable social groups.1 This \nis why ADM tools must be made sufficiently transparent, so that independent observers can monitor \nand assess the different platforms\u2019 ADM tools and decision-making criteria for content moderation.

","1842":"An  effective  sanctioning  regime  will  be  necessary  in  cases  of  negligence.  It  should  enforce  fines \nproportional  to  the  damage  the  dominant  player  has  inflicted  to  the  market.  The  fines  should  be \nbackdated  to  account  for  the  entire  period  of  market  abuse,  and  orders  to  stop  abusive  market \nbehaviour should be enforced a soon as the threshold for adequate evidence is met \u2013 even prior to \nconcluding the examination, which could take years ","1843":"Equal  enforcement  of  the  DSA  across  the  Union  will  be  a  daunting  task.

Besides  lacking  the \nnecessary  resources,  this  approach  would  cause  fragmentation  in  the  EU  Single  Market,  through \ninconsistent  interpretation  of  rules  and  enforcement.

These features in turn frequently give rise to a number of the scenarios identified in question 7, particularly (i) the extension of market power to new markets (leveraging), (ii) anti-competitive monopolisation, (iii) gatekeeper situations and (iv) winner takes all dynamics, all of which have been demonstrated to have the potential for significant adverse effects on competition.\nWe agree with the descriptions provided, but would highlight that gatekeeping scenarios should be interpreted broadly, as a bottleneck whereby other providers can only reach users through a particular service provider or platform, or where the terms of market access are affected by a firm\u2019s control over technologies or data that are significant for the provision of other digital goods or services. As a result of this control, the gatekeeper determines the market dynamics of both its core platform market and related or adjacent markets to which the core market facilitates access. For example, the control of an app store can affect a wide range of other digital markets (including financial services) by virtue of its gatekeeper role determining which apps or which software and hardware functionalities are available to consumers.\nThe commonality across digital markets of the underlying features and resulting scenarios that pose a threat to competition indicates that these problems are structural in nature.\nIn addition, these scenarios have a number of elements in common and in practice are likely to overlap:\n?\tAnti-competitive monopolisation can stem from competitors\u2019 lack of fair access to a facility that is essential to the provision of a good or service, such as a patent, infrastructure or data. Similarly, a leveraging strategy deployed by a firm in order to extend its market power to related markets may utilise its ability to provide access to an essential facility to its own service or products, while denying fair access to competitors.\n?\tGatekeeping scenarios - this market power can in turn be used to engage in anti-competitive monopolisation and\/or leveraging strategies that allow the firm to extend its power into new markets.\n?\tTipping or winner-takes-all dynamics typically generate a gatekeeper position: reaching a critical threshold of customers and more easily capturing the remaining customers in the market results in a scenario where customers use just one service provider or platform.\nWithin the financial services sector there are several current and potential examples of these scenarios. The provision of digital financial services increasingly relies on a number of digital markets and technologies, including:\n1. Availability and control of digital infrastructure\n?\tCertain digital infrastructure directly affects the distribution of financial services to customers (e.g. whether a financial services app is in an app store) or the availability and quality of particular financial services functions (e.g. whether contactless transactions are possible with a mobile device).\n?\tPlatform firms providing digital infrastructure have vertically integrated services that compete directly with those provided by financial services firms. By denying access to digital infrastructure or providing access on worse terms than to the vertically integrated service (self-preferencing), the platform firm provides itself with an advantage over its competitors, preventing competition on the merits and allowing it to leverage its existing market power to foreclose markets.\n2. Control over consumer gateways\n?\tActing as the first point of contact with the consumer across a range of relationships (including search, app stores, e-commerce or social networks) allows platform firms to discover customer\u2019 financial services needs and preferences in real-time, and to distribute financial services as an accompanying or ancillary service.\n3. Control over key data sources\n?\tData embedded in non-financial digital services is relevant for the provision of financial services (e.g. for creditworthiness assessments). Platform firms are able to leverage data obtained by virtue of a gatekeeper role, and which is frequently collected on terms where users have little option but to agree to its use given the market power of the platform, to enter financial services markets.\nFirms with control over these markets, channels, technologies and data are or would be in a position to use this market power to extend that power to financial services lines of business and rapidly acquire market share, including through actions to put financial services competitors at a disadvantage.?\tThe expansion of digital firms over time from providers of a narrow set of platform functions to wide digital ecosystems of connecting services is clear evidence that such firms routinely seek to extend their market power into other digital sectors \/ markets.\n?\tWith regards to financial services, all large digital platforms \/ ecosystem firms have entered into financial services verticals, with a particular focus initially on payment services and, to some extent, consumer or small business lending, taking advantage of their market power with respect to access to users\u2019 touch points, access to user data and their control over other essential facilities such as communication technologies necessary for the provision of financial services.\n?\tLeveraging strategies weaken the competitive process in markets by undermining other firms\u2019 ability to compete on the merits, or in the most extreme cases effectively preventing other firms\u2019 from competing at all.\n?\tA repeated strategy by a firm to extend its market power through leveraging could take the form of a number of related but separate actions with the same target market, or a particular action or approach over a period of time.\n?\tLeveraging strategies are likely to lead to a situation where the market being entered also tips, generating market power in the new market or even a winner takes all outcome, even in markets where this was not previously possible and there had been active competition between market participants.\n?\tUltimately this results in less choice for consumers and less competitive pressure within the target market, weakening price and non-price competition and incentives for innovation.\n?\tGiven the prevalence and implications for competition of leveraging strategies in digital markets, authorities should be able to address in a comprehensive way common challenges across platforms, as well as investigate concerns regarding a particular platform or market and take appropriate action.\n?\tIn general, interventions should be oriented towards addressing the particular structural feature (and any related behaviour) that facilitates the leveraging strategy and prevents all market participants from being able to compete on the merits.\n?\tThese interventions should include:\n?\tnew ex ante rules for large gatekeeping platforms, focussed on addressing structural problems that are common across platforms, as well as case-by-case interventions; and\n?\tmore active and faster use of existing competition tools (Articles 101 and 102).\n?\tFor example, digital infrastructure plays a central role in the provision of goods and services across the digital economy, however it is not always available on fair terms to third parties and platforms restrict access in order to benefit their vertically integrated services.

Such data can be used, e.g., for better understand customer preferences and willingness to pay for price discrimination (i.e., algorithmic pricing) and further for obtaining advertising revenues. Furthermore, consumer data is a sharable and re-usable input that can be utilized in developing and producing a variety of different digital services and products. Consequently, there are economies of scope related to (personal) data assets that may provide large incumbents with an incentive for conglomerate acquisitions (i.e., the acquisitions of companies active in seemingly unrelated markets providing non-substitutable products with the acquirer). \nRecent studies suggest that the expanding proliferation of technology companies outside of their core business areas has enabled them to accumulate more sharable inputs, data, and software algorithms that can be used to exploit the data (see, e.g., Koski and Pantzar, 2019).  By the end of 2018, the six US-based technology giants' (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and IBM) total number of acquisitions amounted to over 950, of which almost 70 percent took place during the past ten years.\nWhen a dominant firm in one market can exploit its consumer data outside its primary market, it may also become dominant in the 'connected markets' it enters. Tipped markets provide low incentives for innovation and may deter the market entry of new firms. Consequently, large technology incumbents may not only increase their market power and generate entry barriers by acquiring companies in their core markets. When the dominant company with large consumer data assets acquires a firm outside of its primary markets, it may generate a kill zone for potential market entrants.\nWe have studied the effects of acquisitions made by the six large US-based technology companies on the entry dynamics and venture capital financing in different product markets (Koski et al., 2020). We used data from 742 product markets globally, distinguishing the US and European markets for the years 2003-2018. Our estimation results suggest that the technology giants' buyouts  subsequently reduced market entry rates and decreased available venture capital funding in the target product markets of tech giants' acquisitions. In other words, the acquisitions of data giants seem to generate the so-called kill zone effect. \nOur empirical analysis further suggests that the kill zone effect was strengthened during the 2010s when large technology companies gained increasing access to user data. Furthermore, we find that technology giants' acquisitions of platform companies have decreased market entry in non-platform markets. In the US, unlike in the EU area, also available venture capital financing has declined in such non-platform markets from which technology giants have acquired companies. These empirical findings suggest that the kill zone effect may arise particularly from such acquisitions that accumulate large technology companies' consumer data, and it may also expand to the traditional markets. These findings confirm with the view that a dominant company in one market can exploit consumer data from that market to become dominant in other markets. They are also consistent with the notion that network effects operate non-linearly: as the data giants have spread to more product markets, their effect on competition has increased.\nReferred research available here:\nhttps:\/\/www.etla.fi\/julkaisut\/killers-on-the-road-of-emerging-start-ups-implications-for-market-entry-and-venture-capital-financing\/https:\/\/www.etla.fi\/julkaisut\/teknologiajattien-yritysostoihin-puuttuminen-on-rakenteellisten-kilpailuongelmien-ratkaisun-ytimessa\/Our recent research (discussed in the context of question 6) suggests that the company with market power in a core market tend to extend that market power to other markets it enters.

Additional obligations that reflect other \nEU law principles and objectives such as consumer protection should however be imposed \nseparately on all platforms, for example, in the field of liability of platforms for products \nsold  in  the  marketplaces  and  a  general  duty  to  deal  fairly  with  consumers  (principle  of \n\u201cfairness by design). Furthermore, should there be specific reasons requiring remediation \nof anticompetitive conduct of non-gatekeepers, this could be done by other means, notably \nthrough the NCT or antitrust enforcement.

","1941":"BEUC  suggests  that  the  ex  ante  regulation  should  therefore  first  identify  which \nmarkets\/product  areas  are  susceptible  to  gatekeepers  based  on  the  characteristics \n(identifying criteria) of the markets, e.g. substantial network effects, economies of scale \nand scope, lock-in effects on users\/consumers (and inability of consumers to multi-home), \nhigh switching-costs for consumers and data dependency. Such markets could include for \nexample,  online  intermediation  services  (consumer-facing  online  platforms  such  as  e-\ncommerce marketplaces, social media, mobile app stores, etc), search engines, operating \nsystems for smart devices and online advertising intermediation services, many of which \nhave been already identified and defined in EU law (i.e. Platform to Business Regulation).

","1943":"As a second step, within these markets\/product areas, platforms which fulfilled specified \neasily verifiable criteria set out in the regulation would then be classified as gatekeepers \nand subject to the specific list of prohibitions and obligations. Ideally, these non-cumulative \ncriteria  should include  easily measurable parameters in order to make the regulation as \nstraightforward  as  possible.  These  criteria  could  therefore  include,  at  thresholds  to  be \ndetermined, the number of users in the EU and the EU turnover of the company.9 ","1944":"This  approach  should  enable  platforms  to  unequivocally  determine  whether  they  are \ngatekeepers and thus the need to comply with clear prohibitions and obligations. The ex \nante regulation should also provide for both the market\/product area and platform criteria \nto be regularly reviewable in the review clause of the legislative instrument, for example \nevery two years following a report from the Commission (see below).

Establishing such a \nlist would be a more immediate way to correct harmful practices, and to signal to market \nplayers what is acceptable and what is not. Case by case analysis, though providing more \nflexibility, requires significantly more time to produce results. It seems unlikely that a case \nby  case  approach,  without  precisely  pre-determined  parameters10,  could  be  materially \nquicker  than  a  competition  case  under  existing  law  where  it  requires  the  thorough \ninvestigation and balancing of multiple factors.

Distinctions \nbetween  digital  and  non-digital  markets  are  blurring.  The  Internet  of  Things,  connected \ncars, digital assistants and wearables are examples of this.

This conduct can lead to consumer harms \nin the form of higher prices, lower quality, less choice and innovation. Furthermore, Articles \n101 and 102 TFEU (and merger control) are primarily focused on preventing competition \nfrom declining. The market structure characteristics or features of some markets however \ncan mean that there  is  a need to proactively  promote increased competition.22 A NCT is \ntherefore necessary at EU level23 to deal with both problematic conduct and problematic \nstructures  or  features  as  such  and  open  up  the  potential  for  disruptive  and  innovative \ncompetition from new technologies and business models.

Furthermore, as it is not possible to predict which sectors \nwill raise structural competition concerns in the future, it would be advisable to have the \nflexibility to use it in other sectors, subject to appropriate safeguards. Other sectors such \nas financial services (including payments), energy, healthcare\/pharma and transport have \ndemonstrated structural problems in the past.

A broader tool by contrast would \nlend  itself  better  to  preventing  markets  from  tipping  and  to  considering  more  recent \ndevelopments  such  as  tacit  collusion  through  the  use  of  algorithms  and  potential \nanticompetitive effects of common ownership across sectors (institutional investors owning \nnon-controlling stakes in direct competitors).

","1976":"Not applicableI am not a business operator\/representative of businessesNot applicableNot applicableG - Information asymmetry on the customer side. In insurance traditionally the insurer has more power when it comes to statistical outcomes (e.g. population mortality, frequency of fires etc.) and the customer has more information on his\/her specific situation. If\/when more extensive datasets on consumer behaviour or use of social media etc. become available it will become possible for the insurer to know more of the insured that was possible traditionally. While it can mean that the additional information favours the insured (e.g. early identification of a medical condition through a wearable), it can also  mean that the information asymmetry favours more the insurer in the future. To counterbalance this there needs to be guidelines from EIOPA on the use of data. The guidelines should be principles based to remain valid with changes. There needs to be good governance on the use of data in the insurers. Actuaries as heavy users of data should have a dominant role in such governance. The role of actuaries is emphasized by the fact that as a profession they have a strong code of conduct forcing them to act responsibly in the use of data.\nI - Lack of access to a given input\/asset which is necessary to compete on the market (e.g. access to data). In order to practice insurance sustainably and safely to customers insurers are dependent on data. If access to data gets limited this can lead to less competition in the market. Furthermore, without proper governance mechanisms, a lack of skill in data understanding and data handling (e.g. ensuring high data quality\/use of extrapolation in case of missing data) can have unforeseeable impact on customer level and can massively increase systemic risk.\nQ - Data dependency \u2013 see our answer to I\nR - Use of pricing algorithms. Insurers have in all their history used algorithms with the best available technology to manipulate the data. In the majority of areas algorithms are indispensable and work for the benefit of our societies. While maintaining everything that is good with algorithms we would like to point to two areas:\n- algorithms need to be designed well so that the results they provide are correct. This needs good understanding, good modelling and good governance. Actuaries should have a central role to see this happens\n- algorithms can also be used in the area called premium optimization. While a modest amount of this is unavoidable, massive user of this would not benefit our societies. Again, good governance is needed here. The code of conduct of actuaries limits the design of premium optimization tools in the greater good of customers.Insurance is there to mutualise the economic consequences of risks materializing. To some degree this means that algorithmic pricing or any pricing aligns prices (or, one can say, the risk as such sets the minimum price, and then depending on different strategies insurers can charge less or more above this price). Better algorithmic pricing should lead to a situation where premiums go down to the limit of the pure price of the risk. This however means that competition increases with aligning prices.","1977":"See our answer to question 7.1.Insurance and pensions, see our answer to question 7.1.Premium optimisation, see our answer to question 6 (R)The supervisory authorities of the financial sector, i.t. EIOPA, EBA and ESMA already have strong tools to intervene when necessary. If another framework were created this could easily create overlapping structures that would be burdensome at best but could easily become contradictory.","1978":"The company owns a portfolio of companies that operate online dating products (e.g., Tinder, Hinge, OK Cupid, Match, Meetic, Lexa, Lovescout, etc.).All our online dating platforms are accessible through an Application to be run on smartphones - others are also accessible via web mobile or desktop.Dating apps use a variety of digital services, including:","1979":"First, there is a consensus among competition policy experts that barriers to entry, including large economies of scale and direct and indirect network effects, create structural competition problems. Because of the presence of these factors, in some digital markets the winner takes all and it is hard to challenge its market power through new entry. This has been confirmed in various reports produced by the European Commission (e.g. Competition Policy in a Digital Era), the UK (e.g. Furman Report), the ACCC Digital Market Inquiry, among others. ","1980":"Second, the fact that some users single home may also lead to structural competition problems because it means that digital gatekeepers will not be sufficiently constrained by competition. That is for instance the case with respect to app stores since the vast majority of smartphone users only use iOS or Android devices. Because smartphone users tend to stick with their iOS or Android devices, this means that the App Store and the Play Store will not be constrained by the risk that, should they impose unreasonable terms to app developers\/users, users would migrate to another operating system.","1981":"Third, digital platforms, such as Google and Facebook, combine the data they collect through their various user-facing products (e.g., Search, YouTube, Instagram) and business-facing products (sign-in services, online advertising intermediation services, etc.). This combination of data (or data bundling) protects their dominance in their core market by making market entry difficult (if at all possible) due to their data advantage, as well as conquer adjacent markets based (so-called \u201cenvelopment strategy\u201d). ","1982":"Fourth, zero pricing policies are also problematic. Rivals are only able to compete by generating advertising revenues. This is often difficult considering the dominance Google and Facebook in advertising markets (which is linked to the fact they are allowed to combine data collected over a range of products and thus have a data advantage). This creates a vicious circle: (i) Google provides \u201cfree\u201d services in a range of new markets (e.g., travel booking, etc.) because it can cross-subsidize these revenues through online advertising revenues (search and display ads) and (ii) the \u201cfree\u201d services on these new markets allow it to collect more data, which strengthen its dominance in the subsidizing markets. Additionally Google controls what consumers see giving preference to its own products or to products with joint agreements.  This not only destroys existing competition in a range of markets, but also allows Google to strengthen its market power in markets where no competition exists, ultimately affecting innovation, competition, and user choice. A similar strategy is pursued by Facebook.\nWe think that the four most problematic scenarios are those involving:\n-\tVertical leveraging: As illustrated by numerous competition cases and pending investigations, digital gatekeepers seek to leverage their market power in their core market to adjacent markets. While competition law can be used to bring such attempts to an end, investigations take time and competitive damage may be permanent by the time they are completed, which is particularly problematic in digital markets given the risk of tipping.\n-\tGatekeeper scenarios: When digital platforms control access to a vast number of users, which do not multi-home, they will typically engage in abusive conducts. They may self-preference their own products or they may impose unfair trading terms on the users of their platforms.\n-\tMarket tipping: Some digital markets may tip very quickly due, inter alia, to the presence of strong direct and indirect network effects. When tipping is facilitated by anticompetitive behaviour (exclusive dealing, etc.), competition law can be used to bring such behaviour to an end, but as noted above, competition proceedings may be too slow to prevent tipping. Moreover, tipping may occur as a result of monopolization strategies, which may not be captured by Article 102 TFEU.\n-\tMonopolization: EU competition law suffers from an enforcement gap here as Article 102 TFEU can only be applied in scenarios where dominance can be established. In markets that are at risk of tipping, this is problematic considering that it may delay intervention until such time the competitive has become permanent.See our response to questions 8.3 and 8.4.This strategy raises competition concerns because it can distort competition in an otherwise competitive market.","1983":"For instance, if Google   prominently features its own product on its SERP, it will give a strong competitive advantage to this product over competing products. Despite the Google Shopping decision, Google continues this leveraging strategy, which cements its position on its search engine market, its other consumer-facing products, and its data advantage and increase advertising opportunities  .","1984":"Similarly, Apple is also pursuing a market leveraging strategy by discriminatory in favor of its own apps to the detriment of rival apps. This strategy has been exposed by Spotify in the complaint it filed against Apple.\nGoogle\u2019s repeated self-preferencing strategies on Search shows why a new tool for intervention is needed. Although the Commission focused on the comparison-shopping services market in its Google Shopping case, the same conduct affected many vertical markets, which were however not addressed in the decision because competition proceedings have to be manageable and therefore cannot involve too many vertical markets. This tool should allow the Commission to address the problem at its sources and adopt remedies that would target the conduct \u201cas a whole\u201d rather than merely its impact in a narrow market. ","1985":"The same should be said about Apple. While competition law can be used to address the leveraging of its market power in the distribution of apps to iOS users (e.g., the Commission\u2019s Apple investigation in response to the Spotify complaint), Apple\u2019s abuse of its market power to the detriment of app developers and app users is endemic and thus requires a regulatory response.","1986":"The same could also be said about Facebook. Leveraging its dominant position as a \"must uses\" in marketing \/ advertising, Facebook \n- unilaterally dictate terms vis-\u00e0-vis its (business) customers, incl. refusing limitations on data use \n- launching and growing in new markets without meaningful investment, at a below\/no cost to users, in short time\nIt is to be noted that Facebook recently entered the dating market, which represents a major threat for provider of dating services as Facebook will be in position to leverage its market power in social media to conquer the dating services market. This threat is real since for instance, while the Facebook Marketplace was only introduced in 2016, it now has about 900 million users. This threat is compounded by the fact that Facebook\u2019s dating service is provided free of charge as it is monetized through ads. Moreover, by entering into dating service, Facebook will allow itself to collect additional large troves of data and further increase the data advantage it already has over actual and potential rivals. It also creates further threat for users given Facebook poor privacy record.Articles 101 and 102 TFEU have some limitations. In the case of Article 102 TFEU, dominance needs to be established for that provision to apply. The Commission is subject to a heavy burden of proof, which it may have difficulties to meet in opaque markets. Remedies are also limited to addressing the competition concerns identified in the specific market(s) at hand. Thus, Article 102 TFEU is not an ideal tool to address structural problems.Digital marketsThere are many circumstances in which app developers like Match have been placed \u201cat a disadvantage in the market unfairly, for instance, by imposing unfair business practices or by limiting access to key inputs, such as data.\u201d\nFor instance, app developers are dependent on Apple\u2019s App Store to reach their customers \/ user base. This gatekeeping role of Apple (which operates as amonopoly on iOS for distribution of apps) allows it to engage, inter alia, in the following conducts:\n(i)\tApple can and does restrict access to its App Store, thus ultimately deciding which apps are available to users. This is because before apps or app updates are made available in the Apple App Store, they have to undergo a strict review and approval processthat is not transparent and solely decided by Apple. Apple has unfettered power to examine and decide whether an app complies with its (often vague) guidelines. Not only is the initial review carried out by Apple employees, but also appeals to any rejection are also handled internally by Apple (generally more experienced Apple reviewers).  Apple imposes these rules in a black box and an an arbitrary manner.  For example, it is reported that there are a set of \u201cunwritten\u201d App Store rules where Apple grants sweetheart deals large partners such as Amazon \n(see: https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/7\/30\/21348108\/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions). \n(ii)\tApple can limit interoperability, as it controls APIs \u2013 i.e. the technological specifications that enable app developers to gain access for their apps to the smartphone\u2019s hardware features (e.g. the camera or location services), or to particular services and other apps installed on the device. Thus, Apple is in the position to hamper the proper functioning of third-party apps, while being able to favor its own apps. \n(iii)\tApple and can set the rules of the game, obliging app developers to use Apple\u2019s proprietary in-app payment solution, namely In-App Purchase (\u201cIAP\u201d), to pay a 30% commission on the transaction value and to conform with Apple and Google\u2019s guidelines and marketing restrictions (which ensure that app developers will not circumvent IAP and the 30% commission). These practices negatively impact competition, innovation and consumer welfare.See our response to Question 10.3Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance to be applicable. This is a handicap in markets that can quickly tip since, by the time dominance has been reached by the firm engaging in unfair practices to the detriment of rivals, the market may have tipped and the damage to competition will be permanent. There is thus an enforcement gap.See our response to question 10.7. Because digital markets can tip quickly, swift intervention, even below the dominance threshold level, may be necessary to protect competition.Article 101 TFEU may not be the right tool when the harmful conduct is unilateral. Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance, which may delay intervention until the damage to competition has become permanent.","1987":"-\tE-commerce marketplace: Amazon is an extremely strong market position, which will be hard to challenge by actual or potential rivals. \nThere is a quasi-consensus on the fact that the presence of the market features listed in question 10.3 makes a market prone to tipping. The evidence is overwhelming. In fact, the expert reports that have been prepared under the aegis of the EC (Competition Policy in a Digital Era), the UK government (the Furman report), the University of Chicago (Stigler report), etc., all confirm this.See our response to questio 16.2When a market tips, efficient and innovative firms may be excluded because they may be unable to reach the scale that is necessary to compete in the market. This  impacts customer choice and innovation.   Consumers are harmed by lack of options for services or by not being able to use new innovative products.  Additionally, in markets which have tipped, the dominant company is able to force pricing regimes on both consumers and companies dependent on the monopoly service.  Both Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store impose a 30% surcharge on goods they arbitrarily deem as consumed within such digital apps.  ","1988":"When free market competition does not exist and where regulators do not act to protect consumers, monopolists inevitably  increase prices. In two-sided markets where the service is given away for free on one-side on the free, consumer-facing, side the market, price increases can be excepted on the paying side (typically, online advertising). Thus, while end-users on the free side of the market might not suffer from higher prices, advertisers may have to pay more to the platform (which may in turn impact their own customers in terms of higher prices).Due to the nature of monopoly services, a competitive marketplace will not return to a tipped market unless regulatory bodies rectify the inequities. The Commission should have tools which will allow it to intervene in a decisive manner before the market has tipped.Articles 101 and 102 may not be sufficient to prevent tipping. While the former does not apply to unilateral conduct, the latter requires a showing of dominance, which may delay intervention.","1989":"in addition, competition law investigations are time consuming and markets may have tipped by the time the Commission reaches decision point.Key features of a number of digital markets (e.g. high barriers to entry due to large economies of scale, the presence of strong direct and indirect network effects, etc.) create a risk that the winner takes all, thereby virtually eliminating all other competition. This has happened in critically important markets such as algorithmic search, social media, the separate markets for the distribution of apps to iOS and Android device users, e-commerce, etc. Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook are all gatekeepers.","1990":"-\tThe lack of multi-homing is also an important factor as multi-homing constrains the market power of a digital platform. If each iOS device user also owned an Android device, Apple would not be able to impose unfair trading terms on app developers. That is, however, not the case. Virtually no mobile phone individual users multihome.","1991":"-\tThe fact that business users need to accept the terms and conditions of a platform even if they are anticompetitive \/ unfair constitutes evidence that the platform enjoys significant market power and that there is little multi-homing.We think that the three competition concerns identified in 18.9 are critically important. For instance, the problem app developers face when dealing with digital gatekeepers, such as Apple and Google on their app stores, is that they must agree to their terms and conditions even if they are unfavorable to them. As these gatekeepers play the role of regulators in their respective markets, app developers have no choice but to accept their rules, however anticompetitive\/unfair they may be.A special tool is needed to address the structural competition problems created by digital platforms. \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU may not be the adequate vehicles to address these problems because competition law investigations are facts-specific and thus tend to be narrowly focused, and competition law investigations take time. \nThere is therefore a need for tool that would allow the Commission to take a broader, market-wide view of the problems and adopt broader remedies.See our response to question 19.1Structural competition problems can also arise in other sectors if these sectors share some of the features of the digital sector, e.g. the presence of gatekeepers. Thus, there is no reason why the New Competition Tool should be limited to digital markets only.","1992":"Article 101 TFEU will generally not allow to capture problematic unilateral conduct.In any market situation where the conduct is unilateral.Article 102 TFEU is subject to a number of limitations: (i) a showing of dominance is needed. In markets that are prone to tipping, this may delay intervention; (ii) it is not able to capture monopolization strategies (enforcement gap); (iii) due to the heavy burden of proof imposed on the Commission and the need to show effects to establish an infringement, Article 102 TFEU investigations take time, which is problematic in markets prone to tipping.The issues identified in 23.1 are not specific to any specific digital market. They represent general limitations to Article 102 TFEU.See our responses aboveSee our responses aboveIt depends on the considered markets and companies. The tool should be therefore both dominance-based and structure-based. For instance, while the issues raised by the applications shops platforms should be addressed with a structure-based tool, the issues raised by the dominance on the marketing\/advertising online market by the biggest search engines and the biggest social media companies should be addressed with a dominance-based tool.","1993":"The above tools are valuable, but the Commission should ensure that digital gatekeepers are not allowed to engage in obfuscation strategies as is regularly the case.The Commission should be allowed to do all the above, as the type of remedies needed depends on the identified problem. The Commission should thus have an important degree of flexibility when defining remedies.","1994":"Structural remedies are preferable when monitoring is likely to be difficult, which is often the case given the complexity and the opacity of the digital gatekeepers\u2019 practices.It seems difficult to see how the Commission could address structural competition problems without enjoying appropriate investigative powers.To properly address structural competition problems the EU Commission needs, in our view, to enjoy all the powers above.If deadlines are not binding, they will not be complied with, in particular given the digital gatekeepers\u2019 strategy of obfuscation.Regulation 1\/2003 allows the Commission to adopt interim measures but the Commission has rarely used that tool. The adoption of interim measures is, however, desirable in markets prone to tipping and where harm to competition if challenged too late may become permanent The Commission should consider proposing a test for the adoption of interim measures that is easier to meet than the test contained in Regulation 1\/2003.Yes, voluntary commitments may be a way to obtain faster results than a full market investigation.Yes, that is important from a due process standpoint, but this should not create an opportunity to delay the final decision.Yes, that is important from a due process standpoint, but this should not create an opportunity to delay the final decision.Yes, that is important from a due process standpoint, but this should not create an opportunity to delay the final decision.In our view, ideally, the new competition tool should be a combination of both dominance-based and structure-based.

To this \nend, the main identification process relies on a direct identification of DPs with SIP by means \nof  reasonable  and  easily-observable  absolute  thresholds  for  each  AoB  (e.g.  revenues, \nnumber  of  unique  users,  etc.)  in  order  to  quickly  identify  the  large  DPs  who  are  legally \npresumed  to  have  SIP  without  any  further  assessment  by  the  competent  body.  The  list  of \nAoBs,  the  structural  and  specific  criteria  to  assess  the  DP\u2019s  SIP,  as  well  as  the  absolute ","2010":"BEREC also recognises that some DPs active in one\/some specific AoB(s) and presenting a \ncombination  of  relevant  structural  and  specific  features,  may  not  be  large  enough  to  meet \nthe  absolute  thresholds  set  for  distinctive  AoB,  but  still  be  in  a  position  to  de  facto  exert  a \nSIP. In order to tackle this SIP and as far as it is deemed strictly necessary to address the \nidentified  concerns,  BEREC  proposes  an  optional  identification  process  in  which  the \ncompetent  body  may  conduct  individual  SIP  assessments  ex  officio  or  intervene  based  on \ncomplaints. ","2011":"Irrespective  of  the  identification  process  (direct  or  optional),  all  DPs  with  SIP  should  be \nsubject to an asymmetric regulatory intervention consisting of (i) principle-based obligations \nand  prohibitions  (e.g.  transparency  and  non-discrimination  among  business  users,  i.e. \nOption  3a  of  the  DSA  inception  impact  assessment),  and,  (ii)  tailored  and  proportionate \nremedies  when  necessary  (depending  on the  nature  and  the  level  of  issues  at  stake, such \nremedies could include access to essential inputs and\/or assets, e.g. some level of services \ninteroperability  through  the  use  of  open  APIs  or  open  standards  and  data  portability).  This \nwould correspond to Option 3b of the DSA inception impact assessment. ","2012":"First  of  all,  there  are  number  of  important  features  which  any  regulatory  authority  with \nresponsibility for regulating DPs with SIP should benefit from. Regulatory authorities should \nbe  independent,  have  relevant  expertise  in  relation  to  ex-ante  regulation  and  the  ability  to \nencompass multiple perspectives (i.e. technical, economic, legal, accounting and end-users\u2019 \nrights).  ","2013":"Moreover, in BEREC\u2019s view, the geographical scope (pan-EU, regional, meaning several EU \ncountries,  or  national)  of  the  concerns  raised  by  DPs  should  determine  which  regulatory \nbody\/bodies  is\/are  involved  in  defining  the  regulatory  measures,  as  well  as  their \nenforcement. BEREC believes that there is a need for a specific regulatory authority at the \nEuropean level, collaborating with a strong network of regulatory authorities represented in \nan  Advisory  Body.  This  would  ensure  a  harmonised  implementation  of  the  regulatory \nframework for DPs with SIP.  ","2014":"The  BEREC  cooperation  framework  can  be  considered  as  a  well-functioning  reference \nmodel. BEREC and its member NRAs are well placed to effectively take on the roles of the \nAdvisory  Board  and  the  National  Regulatory  Bodies  as  presented  in  the  proposed \ninstitutional  design.  This  would  have  the  advantage  of  building  on  their  valuable  ex  ante-\nexperience and structure and would allow for a faster institutional set-up. ","2015":"BEREC stresses that the ex-ante regulatory framework for ECS is already addressing most \nstructural competition issues, as well as reaching a variety of broader objectives. The NCT, if \nimplemented  by \nthe  competent  regulatory  authority,  could  potentially  serve  as  a \ncomplementary  tool  in  exceptional  cases  not  currently  addressed  by  sectoral  regulation. \nNevertheless, attention should be paid to potential overlap between the ECS framework and \nthe  NCT  since  this  could  raise  legal  uncertainty  and  have  serious  implications  for \ninvestments in a dynamic and competitive sector. In order to address this potential overlap, \nand following the principle of lex specialis, the regulatory framework for ECS should be the \napplicable legislation. ","2016":"Moreover,  BEREC  believes  that,  given  its  two-decade  experience  in  the  sector,  ECS \nregulatory authorities are in the best position (as they are already doing so) to carry out an \nanalysis aimed at identifying structural competition concerns in the ECS markets which are \nnot  addressed  by  the  current  regulatory  framework.  If  the  need  for  further  regulatory \nintervention  is  identified  in  this  sector,  then  NRAs  should  be  empowered  with  appropriate, \nnecessary  tools  and  competences  in  order  to  ensure  an  effective  and  consistent \nimplementation of the sectoral regulatory framework. This could be done by a revision of the \nexisting framework or by assigning the power of applying the NCT in the ECS sector to the \ncompetent NRAs, in order to avoid an overlap in competences between different authorities. ","2017":"Similarly,  the  regulatory  model  for  DPs  with  SIP  proposed  by  BEREC  is  also  designed  to, \ninter  alia,  address  structural  and  competition  concerns  in  digital  environments.  Therefore, \nBEREC  believes  that  the  challenges  identified  in  these  environments  could  only  be \neffectively  targeted  by  an  ex-ante  intervention  within  a  specific,  consistent  regulatory \nframework, rather than by a general-purpose ex-ante tool (e.g. NCT), which may not reach \nthe same objective(s).

They  have  facilitated  access  by  both  business  and  end-users  to  goods, \nservices and information, and provided a wide range of efficiencies by reducing transaction, \nsearch and distribution costs.

Building  on  this,  BEREC  considers  that  its  expertise  can  contribute  to \neffectively designing a regulatory model for intervention towards DPs with SIP.  ","2021":"BEREC  considers  that  establishing  a  specialised  regulatory  framework  for  DPs  with \nSignificant  Intermediation  Power  (SIP)  could  allow  for  a  well-designed,  proportionate,  and \npredictable  scheme  for  intervention.  Such  ex-ante  intervention  would  not  be  aimed  at \nregulating  the  digital  sector,  nor  the  Internet  as  a  whole,  but  at  tackling  specific  concerns \nraised by DPs with SIP, in order to ensure that competition and innovation are encouraged, \nthat  end-users\u2019  rights  are  protected,  and  that  the  digital  related  environment  is  open  and \ncompetitive. ","2022":"The  model  proposed  in  Section  1  is  built  on  BEREC\u2019s  experience  gathered  in  ex-ante \nregulation in the ECS sector (that may be adjustable in many aspects to DPs), as well as on \nthe insights and analyses on DPs carried out by some of its members in the last years.

As always, any input from the European institutions and relevant stakeholders \non BEREC\u2019s work on this topic will be welcome, and BEREC would welcome the opportunity \nto share its experience and expertise.  ","2025":"In its response, BEREC will focus on digital platforms (DPs), rather than online platforms, to \ninclude  platforms  not  strictly  providing  online  services  but  which  may  still  control  and \ninfluence  access  to  them  (e.g.  operating  systems).  BEREC  considers  that  the  \u201cgatekeeper \nrole\u201d is not the only factor strengthening the power of large DPs. Given the main role of DPs \nas intermediary between several types of users (business users \u2013 including competitors and \nproviders  of  complementary  services  \u2013  and  end-users  \u2013  mostly  consumers),  and  between \nusers  and  a  variety  of  services\/products,  BEREC  considers  that  DPs  should  be  targeted \nbased  on  their  Significant  Intermediation  Power  (SIP).  Similarly  to  the  assessment  of \nsignificant market power in the ECS sector, SIP should be identified based on a combination \nof structural and specific criteria. ","2026":"First  of  all,  given  the  challenges  in  defining  clear  boundaries  for  relevant  markets  in  which \nDPs  operate,  BEREC  proposes  to  focus  on  the  Area(s)  of  Business  (AoB)  in  which  DPs \npresent structural\/specific criteria. The list of AoBs should be laid down in (an) EU-level legal \nact(s)  and  should  be  subject  to  regular  revision.  An  AoB  could  be  e.g.  e-commerce,  app \nstores,  online  search,  OS,  voice  assistants  etc.,  and  would  be  characterised  by  features \nsuch as: ","2027":"As  regards  the  direct  identification  process  of  DPs  with  SIP,  BEREC  suggests  that \nreasonable  and  easily-observable  absolute  thresholds  (e.g.  revenues,  number  of  unique \nusers, etc.) for each AoB, are defined in (an) EU-level legal act(s), in order to quickly identify \nthe large DPs who are presumed to have SIP. These thresholds may vary depending on the \nrespective  AoB  and  should  be set  at  such  a  level  that  does  not  impact SMEs  and\/or small \nplatforms  which  are  less  likely  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  AoB  they  are  active  in. \nThese thresholds could be subject to the same regular revision as the definition of AoB. For \na  DP  being  active  in  a  pre-defined  AoB  and meeting  the  identified  thresholds for this  AoB, \nthe combination of criteria listed in Q2 above and the presence of SIP would be presumed \nwithout any further assessment by the competent body. ","2028":"BEREC  also  recognises  that  some  DPs  active  in  one\/some  specific  AoB(s)  (for  example \nB2B-platforms for certain industries) and presenting a combination of relevant structural and \nspecific criteria, may not be large enough to meet the absolute thresholds set for distinctive \nAoB, but still be in a position to de facto exert a SIP. In order to tackle this SIP, which would ","2029":"BEREC  believes  that  this  double  approach  (direct  identification  of  DPs  with  SIP  based  on \nabsolute thresholds, as well as the possibility for an individual SIP assessment when strictly \nneeded  to  tackle  relevant  concerns  which  would  not  be  addressed  by  a  direct  SIP \nidentification process) is better-suited to ensure timely intervention, regulatory predictability, \nand to enable digital environments to thrive.  ","2030":"Structural  features  in  relation  to  AoB  are  set  forth  under  Q2  above  (Main  features  of \ngatekeeper  online  platform  companies);  how  to  combine  the  relevant  criteria  in  order  to \nidentify  the  DPs  which  should  be  targeted  by  an  ex-ante  intervention  is  presented  in  Q3 \nabove (Main features of gatekeeper online platform companies).

Examples:  a)  unfair \nranking\/steering  for  third  parties  products  or  services,  b)  pre-installation  and \ndefault  settings  of  that  third  party\u2019s  products\/services,  c)  discrimination  in \nenforcing terms and condition without reasonable cause. ","2032":"g)  Tying  and  bundling  (e.g.  with  the  goods\/services  offered  by  the  DP  with  SIP, \nand\/or specific third-party  business  users)  if the conduct  e.g.  reduces  the  ability \nof  competitors  to  provide  a  specific  service\/good  or  requires  them  to  enter \nmultiple  markets,  or  at  least  offer  additional  products  or  services,  in  order  to \ncompete and is not objectively justified. ","2033":"Even though it is an M&A issue and not an issue to be regulated within the present context, \nit is worth mentioning that large DPs with significant financial resources may also use such \nfunding to acquire\/control significant stakes in promising competitors. If the stakes are used \nto suppress direct competition, negative effects may arise. ","2034":"The  analysis  of  increasing relevant  user  data  can  give  DPs  a  better  understanding  of  both \nusers\u2019  needs  and  market  trends.  It  will  also  reinforce  their  ability  to  engage  in  behaviours \nwhich  protects  them  from  inter-platform  competition  (such  as  acquiring  or  foreclosing \nnascent  rivals)  or  intra-platform  competition  (such  as  imposing  unfair  \u2013  exclusionary  or \nexploitative \u2013 terms and conditions, or denying access to data). End-user data can also be \ncollected in an unfair and\/or non-transparent way. ","2035":"It is important to keep in mind that collecting data or being in control of large amounts of data \nis  not  an  anti-competitive  conduct  in  itself  (unless  it  is  excessive,  see  Q9  above,  point  2b) \nbut  with  that  being  said,  large  amounts  of  data  and  data-sharing  between  services  might \nlead to an increase of barriers to entry and increase SIP, i.e. give more power to leverage.  ","2036":"In  cases  where  barriers  to  entry  do  arise,  there  may  be  a  risk  for  reduced  innovation  and \ncompetition from alternative actors, which might ultimately lead to reduced consumer choice \n(see also Q11 below). Also, a DP with SIP possessing large amounts of relevant data that \nconstitute  essential  input  is  in  a  position  to  cause  harm  in  relation  to  the  provision  of  the \ngoods\/services  where  the  DP  has  SIP  (the  conduct  would  be  denying  access  to  relevant \nnon-replicable  data).  It  could  also  cause  harm  in  providing  other  (potentially  currently  non-\nexisting)  goods\/services  by  leveraging  its  SIP  into  complementary  services  (e.g.  by \nincreasing  the  entry  barriers,  for  the  services  where  the  DP  has  SIP  \u2013  such  as  combining \ndata  from  several  different  AoBs  \u2013,  or  for  leveraging  other  goods\/services)  in  a  way  that \nreduces consumer welfare. ","2037":"Digital services are driven by continuous and fast innovation. DPs with SIP may enable low \ntransaction costs for innovators and thereby foster small-scale or incremental innovation that \nsupports or complements their SIP. However, as discussed under Q9 above, DPs with SIP \nmay also steer and impede innovation. Such potential harm to the competitive process and \ninnovation might have a serious negative impact on business users and thereby reduce end-\nusers\u2019 choice.  ","2038":"A  DP  with  SIP  has  the  ability  and  may  have  the  incentive  to  exclude  or  impede  any \ndisrupting innovation that endangers its position (see the conducts discussed in response to \nQ9  above).  By  foreclosing  competitors,  the  DP  with  SIP  could  reduce  its  own  incentive  to \ninnovate  while  also  protecting  its  position  from  potentially  disruptive  innovation.  The  wider \nthe geographic scope of the DP with SIP, the greater the potential impact on competition and \ninnovation.  ","2039":"Complementary services are not directly competing with the DP. For these services, it is less \nlikely  that  they  will  undermine  the  DP\u2019s  SIP  by  disruptive  innovation  and  backward \nintegration.  Thus,  the  DP  with  SIP  does  not  have  the  same  incentive  to  foreclose  as  for \n(potentially) disruptive innovation. However, the DP with SIP may still engage in exclusionary \nconduct towards competing services if it decides to start supplying similar services itself or is \nalready doing so. That may also relate to strategic information or data the DP with SIP has \naccess  to.  Furthermore,  the  DP  with  SIP  has  the  ability  and  may  have  the  incentive  to \nengage in exploitative conduct towards complementary services (e.g. excessive pricing). For \nthe  providers  of  complementary  services  that  are  exposed  to  the  SIP  of  the  DP,  such \nexploitative conduct may reduce their return on investment and, consequently, the incentive \nto innovate. This type of conduct could be applied both when the DP with SIP offers similar \nservices, and when the DP with SIP merely serves as an intermediary.  ","2040":"The  power  of a  DP  with  SIP to  act  independently  of  users  on  one  side of  a  platform might \nreinforce  its  ability  and  incentive  to  also  act  independently  on  the  other  side.  The  lack  of \ncompetitive  pressure  from  business  users  on  the  DP  with  SIP  may  allow  the  latter  to  set \nprices  or  terms  and  conditions  to  end-users  that  would  not  be  viable  in  a  competitive \nsituation or vice versa \u2013 when end-users solely rely on the DP with SIP and business users \nmust inevitably accept the terms and conditions set by the DP with SIP to access such end-\nusers.  ","2041":"BEREC and NRAs play an important role in ensuring this by protecting end-users\u2019 rights and \nensuring  the  uninterrupted  operation  of  the  internet  ecosystem  as  an  engine  of  innovation, \ne.g.  through  regulating  the  practices  of  ISPs  under  the  Open  Internet  Regulation.  As \ndiscussed  before,  DPs  with  SIP  can  also  control  access  to  significant  amount  of  data, \ncontent, services and information and this can result in positive and negative societal effects. ","2042":"In  general,  DPs  contribute  to  the  ability  for  people  around  the  world  to  get  in  touch  and \ncommunicate  with  each  other  in  a  very  convenient  way  and  at  relatively  low  or  even  no \nadditional  monetary  cost  (e.g.  social  media  platforms).  Furthermore,  DPs  have  made  it \neasier to access information (e.g. by collecting online reviews and\/or offering search engines \netc.)  which,  when  provided  in  a  transparent  manner,  have  empowered  end-users  and \nallowed them to make better-informed choices. DPs have also made it possible for SMEs to \nsell  their  products  and\/or  services  on  these  platforms.  When  the  DP  incorporates  a  more \nextensive offer and a fair ranking system to assist in finding products\/services, these SMEs \ncan reach a large number of end-users, thus reducing the search costs of end-users. ","2043":"Some  DPs  (e.g.  OSs,  app  stores,  voice  assistants)  have  become  important  gateways  to \naccess and provide services\/products on the internet. They have the ability to choose and\/or \nthe  closed  environment  (or \ninfluence  (i) \necosystem)  they  control,  and  (ii)  which  functionalities  (e.g.  APIs)  are  available  to  business \nusers  on  their  platform  and  under  which  conditions.  If  this  is  done  based  on  unfair  or \nunreasonable conditions in an environment (or ecosystem) serving a large number of users \nand  encompassing  access  to  a  variety  of  services  across  multiple  AoBs,  the  control \nexercised  can  be  used  in  a  way  that  negatively  affects  consumer  choice,  freedom  of \nexpression and media plurality. This is also the case for ranking interfaces and algorithms, \nas these act as nudging instruments for which information is shown to end-users at all and\/or \nin which order.  ","2044":"Moreover, excessive data collection beyond what is allowed by GDPR, can have a negative \neffect on consumer protection when combined with unclear and non-transparent terms and \nconditions on how this data is collected, combined and used. Especially since data is used \nby certain DPs with SIP as a means of (cross-)subsidising their services.  ","2045":"First of all, some of the identified concerns result from structural features, which should be \naddressed independently of any potentially abusive behaviour by DPs with SIP. In this case, \nthe  application  of  ex-ante  dedicated  rules  is  well-suited.  For  instance,  the  control  over  a \ndigital  bottleneck  and  the  resulting  control  over  over  essential  inputs\/assets  provides  DPs \nwith  SIP\u2019s  with  a  significant  competitive  advantage  which  could  negatively  affect  inter-  and \nintra-platform  (or  ecosystem)  competition.  In  some  circumstances,  conditions  for  effective \ncompetition need to be created, or at least facilitated, in order to achieve efficient outcomes. \nEx-ante  regulatory  frameworks  have  proven  to  be  efficient  to  foster  competition  and \ncontestability.  ","2046":"Moreover,  an  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  is  better-suited  to  pursue  a  variety  of  different \nobjectives which have a positive impact on users and society at large. Along with fostering \ncompetition,  multiple  objectives  \u2013  such  as  supporting  an  open  internet  or  achieving  the \nEuropean  internal  market  \u2013,  could  be  pursued  within  a  specific  regulatory  framework,  thus \nensuring a more comprehensive and consistent intervention. ","2047":"Timely  actions,  as  well  as  flexibility  of  the  intervention,  are  crucial  in  order  to  be  effective. \nDPs  are  fast-moving,  innovative  businesses  that  are  constantly  evolving  over  time.  These \ncharacteristics  require  a  regulatory  framework  which  is  quick  and  flexible:  it  should  be \nadjustable  to  the  business  model,  characteristics  and  conduct  of  each  DP  with  SIP  that  is \nregulated, but should also adapt over time as well. ","2048":"The  same  would  be  true  for  how  these  rules  are  applied  and  enforced  in  practice.  An \nexample  hereof  from  the  ECS  sector  is  the  prohibition  for  ISPs  to  technically  discriminate \nbetween  internet  traffic  with  no  objective  reason  (Open  Internet  Regulation).  These \nprohibitions are applied to all ISPs, but enforced in a tailored manner.  ","2049":"Enforcement  is  a  key  and  complex  issue.  One  example  from  BEREC\u2019s  experience  in  the \nECS  sector  is  in  determining  whether  differences  in  treatment  may  be  objectively  justified. \nThis  is  why  clear  principles  on  how  and  when  certain  prohibitions  should  be  applied  are \nnecessary, which is especially important given that DPs are even more heterogeneous than \nECS providers (see also Q24 below - Regulation of large online platform companies acting \nas gatekeepers). ","2050":"As  discussed  in  Q10  below,  remedies  imposed  on  a  case-by-case  basis  may  also  be \nimposed on DPs with SIP, if deemed necessary to address the identified concerns (Q9 and \nQ13  above  \u2013  Emerging  issues).  All  interventions  would  need  to  be  proportionate.  In  this \ncontext,  case-by-case  assessment  is  important  in  order  to  ensure  that  regulation  is \nproportionate.  As  usual,  due  care  should  be  taken  not  to  disproportionately  reduce  the \nincentives to compete, internalise efficiencies, invest or innovate (for DPs with SIP and new \nentrants).  ","2051":"BEREC  considers  that  both  principle-based  obligations  and  case-by-case  remedies  should \nbe  part  of  the  regulatory  toolbox.  The  principle-based  ex-ante  obligations  should  be  less \nintrusive  as  tailor-made  remedies  applied  on  a  case-by-case  basis  (see  answer  to  Q10 \nbelow). These general obligations would be imposed on all DPs with SIP and could include \nobligations  on  transparency,  which  would  require  the  DP  with  SIP  to  make  specific \ninformation easily available.  ","2052":"If  it  is  combined  with  an  access  and\/or  interoperability  remedy  (See  Q10  below),  it  could \ncontain provisions to enable access and\/or interoperability, such as technical specifications \nand expected developments. In addition to that, it could be explored whether in some cases, \ne.g.  when  transparency  obligation  is  coupled  with  access  remedy,  some  parts  of  the  DP \nterms  and  conditions,  or  at  least  their  amendments,  may  be  approved  by  the  competent \nregulatory body.  ","2053":"A transparency remedy could also include a description of which end-user data is collected \nand  how  it  is  used.  There  are  two  goals  with  this  remedy.  The  first  is  to  enable  business \nusers to more efficiently use a data access remedy. The second is to empower end-users, \nsupporting one of the pillars mentioned in the European Data Strategy (COM(2020)66 final), \nthat could be further explored in the context of the Data Act. ","2054":"The  experience  with  ECS  ex-ante  regulation  shows  how  useful  it  is  to  have  a  detailed \nregulatory framework that is applied across the EU. The existence of dedicated rules could \nfacilitate  a  consistent  application  of  regulatory  solutions.  This  would  reduce  regulatory \nfragmentation and encourage EU-level competition between DPs among other things.  ","2055":"There are number of important features which any regulatory authority with responsibility for \nregulating DPs with SIP should benefit from. Regulatory authorities at all levels should have \nrelevant  expertise  in  relation  to  ex-ante  regulation,  i.e.  experience  in  monitoring  and \nanalysing  markets,  enforcement  and  refinement  of  remedies  and  benefitting  from  multiple \nperspectives  (technical,  economic,  legal,  accounting  and  consumer  rights).  Besides, \nregulatory authorities would need to be able to study a wide range of domains in which DPs \noperate and have a deep technical understanding of digital environments. ","2056":"few, say 2 or 3 MSs (level 2), while other DPs may only operate in 1 MS (level 3). Each level \nrequires a different approach. While BEREC assumes that the majority of issues will occur at \nlevel 1, serious concerns may also arise in relation to DPs with SIP operating only in 2 to 3 \nMSs  or  just  at  national  level.  This  could  e.g.  concern  specialized  B2B  supplier-platforms \ntargeting  SME  manufacturers,  comparative  platforms  offering  telecommunication  or  energy \ncontracts  to  consumers,  specialized  e-commerce  platforms  as  well  as  real  estate \nintermediaries that are usually operating at a national level. In addition, while expanding to a \nregional or pan-EU level, DPs with SIP initially focusing on a national scope may stick in the \nmarkets they serve to a differentiated national approach. ","2057":"Similar to the approach used in ex-ante ECS regulation, BEREC considers that \u2013 also in line \nwith  jurisdiction  rules  applicable  to  competition  matters  \u2013  the  jurisdiction  should  be \ndetermined  based  on  the  place  of  provision  of  the  intermediation  service  regardless  of \nwhether  the  DP  with  SIP  involved  is  established  in  a  MS  or  outside  the  EU.  This  principle \nwould also apply in order to determine the jurisdiction within the EU. ","2058":"For  level-1  cases  (pan-EU),  BEREC  believes  that  determining  case-by-case  remedies,  as \nwell as checking compliance with the applicable rules (enforcement), would be best handled \nby an EU Regulatory Body (EURB), which should preferably be based on an already existing \nauthority  -  e.g.  the  European  Commission  -,  to  benefit  from  its  valuable  experience.  This \nwould also allow for a faster set-up of the regulatory body.  ","2059":"This  EURB  should  take  its  decisions  in  consultation  with  an  independent  Advisory  Body \n(AB), composed of competent National Regulatory Bodies (NRBs). The AB has an important \nrole  to  play,  as  it  would  serve  as  a  forum  for  exchanging  best  practices  facilitating \ncooperation  between  NRBs  and  also  acting  as  a  coordinator  between  the  NRBs  and  the \nEURB.  The  existing  well-functioning  collaboration  in  the  field  of  ECS  amongst  expert \npractitioners from the  NRAs  on  the  one  hand  and  between the  European  Commission  and \nBEREC on the other may serve as a good example for such a cooperation model.  ","2060":"In order to lower the regulatory burden for the EURB, it is important to predefine cases and \nregulatory  tasks  without  pan  EU-implications,  which  could  be  directly  addressed  by  the \ncompetent  NRB,  following  the  subsidiarity  principle  as  would  be  the  case  for  pure  national \ncases or disputes with national actors not affecting pan-EU regulation. In such cases, the AB \ncould  play  a  role  in  identifying  the  level  at  which  the  issue  occurs,  in  coordination  with  the \nNRBs  and  the  EURB.  Although  DPs  may  be  active  in  multiple  MSs,  these  issues  may  not \nnecessarily  occur  (to  the  same  extent)  in  each  of  these  MSs.  Therefore,  the  level  should \nactually be determined based on the number of MSs in which the issue occurs.  ","2061":"Concerning  the  access  to  key  inputs  (e.g.  data)  or  assets  (e.g.  technical  functionalities), \nproportionate access remedies could require the DP with SIP to make (part of) their services \ntheir  application \ninteroperable,  either  by  opening,  without  unjustified \nprogramming interfaces (APIs), or by imposing the use of open standards. By accessing key \ninputs  or  assets,  business  users  could  provide  competing  or  complementary \nservices\/products to end-users.  ","2062":"Disproportionate  and\/or  strategical  denial  of  access  to  the  digital  environment  that  the  DP \nwith  SIP  is  offering  could  negatively  affect  both  business  users  (who  could  not  reach  end-\nusers  without  access  to  the  DP  with  SIP\u2019s  environment)  and  consumers  (e.g.  denial  of \naccess  to  reach  or  share  services\/content\/good).  Access  remedies  could  enhance \ncompetition, growth and innovation over several AoB (e.g. by creating a level-playing field for \nbusiness  users),  thereby  increasing  end-users\u2019  choice,  and  the  ability  to  communicate \nwithout unjustified interference.  ","2063":"In  addition  to  that,  ensuring  user-friendly  data  portability  procedures  might  be  a  good \nsolution  for  increasing  the  ability  of  consumers  to  switch  providers  while  keeping  their \nvaluable  data.  In  order  to  make  such  procedures  easily  accessible  and  operational,  highly \ntechnical regulation shaped and enforced by ex-ante regulators might be necessary.  ","2064":"Finally, BEREC also believes that the regulatory toolbox should be complemented with tools \naimed at enhancing information gathering and sharing with stakeholders, in compliance with \ndata  protection  legislation  and  business  confidentiality.  By  applying  to  the  supervision  and \nenforcement  regulatory  tools  mentioned  in  Q24  below  and  Q4  on  Governance  of  digital \nservices and aspects of enforcement, in compliance with GDPR, the forthcoming Data Act, \nand  business  confidentiality,  the  regulatory  body  could  make  relevant  information  provided \nby the DP with SIP, business users or other stakeholders easily available. Provided as open \ndata,  in  a  user-friendly  format  if  possible,  such  information  could  help  users  make  better-\ninformed choices and guide, raise users\u2019 awareness and transparency. ","2065":"Subsequently, a Joint Team (JT) could be put together, composed of staff of the concerned \nNRBs \u2013 taking into account their resource capacity. The initiating NRB may take the lead in \nsetting  up  the  JT  and  coordinating  its  activities.  All  involved  NRBs  need  to  reach  a \nconsensus  expressed  as  \"joint  principles\"  in  line  with  the  common  approach  applied  at the \nEU  level,  which  should  be  transposed  into  the  respective  individual  decisions  of  each \ninvolved  NRB,  taking  into  account  local  particularities.  This  would  allow  for  adjusted \ndecision-making  and  enforcement  at  the  national  level.  Since  level  2  cases  transcend \nnational  interests  and  joint  principles  may serve as  a  precedent,  it  would  be  appropriate  to \nimplement a double lock veto of the EURB and the AB for harmonization purposes, similar to \nwhat exists in the field of ECS.  ","2066":"\u2022  Whether a specific case needs to be considered at level 2 or rather at a pan-European \nlevel, which will determine how and by whom the case should be handled. This would in \nprinciple already be done at the beginning of the process (predefined case, see last \u00a7 of \nQ8), but could have evolved since then. ","2067":"NRBs  are  arguably  well-placed  to  (pro)actively  monitor  the  evolution  of  DPs  within  their \nAoBs  in  their  respective  national  footprints  and  contribute  to  common  positions  and \nguidelines.  NRBs  may  (co-)  engage  in  the  resolution  of  (local)  disputes.  Both  types  of \nactivities should be coordinated by the AB. With reference to Q8 above, BEREC considers \nthat a key requirement for success is the common set of competences NRBs should have.  ","2068":"The cooperation between NRAs under the coordination of BEREC can serve as a reference, \nwhich  has  proven  successful  in  the  field  of  ECS.  In  this  respect,  BEREC  points  out  that \namong  other  contributions  the  many  BEREC  Common  Positions  and  Guidelines,  the \nimplementation  of  arts.  32  and  33  EECC  procedure  and,  not  in  the  least,  the  work  and \ninvestigations  made  by  every-day  practitioners  that  are  close  to  the  activities  and  subject \nmatter  at  hand,  has  enabled  an  efficient and consistent  application  of  ex-ante regulation  in \nthe field of ECS. ","2069":"In order to also ensure a consistent application of ex-ante regulation towards DPs with SIP, \nBEREC and its member NRAs are in a good position to effectively take on the roles of AB \nand  NRBs  respectively.  This  governance  model  would  have  the  advantage  of  benefitting \nfrom their valuable ex-ante experience and structure and of allowing for a faster institutional \nset-up.  In  this  case,  NRAs  should  ensure  to  extend  their  (technical)  capabilities  onto  the \nwide variety of (digital) AoBs in which DPs operate.  ","2070":"The  respective  bodies  identified  above  should  in  general  also  be  competent  for  decision-\nmaking on case-by-case remedies within these levels and could carry out the enforcement of \nthe principle-based and tailored remedies. However, in line with which was mentioned at the \nend  of  Q8,  enforcement  on  remedies  for  level-1  cases  could,  to  the  extent  possible,  be \ndirectly  addressed  by  the  competent  NRB,  following  the  subsidiarity  principle.  This  could \nhave the advantage of being more efficient and effective. In this regard, the application of the \nEU roaming regulation, as well the Open internet regulation, might serve as a good example. ","2071":"General  periodical  data  collection  (as  preparing  clearly  defined  statistics  or  reports  or \nstudies)  from  important  DPs  with  or  without  SIP  should  take  place  both  at  NRB  and  at \nEURB-level, taking into account the proportionality principle. The AB should coordinate the \ndata collections, by providing templates and definitions that are applied in all MSs, aggregate \nat  the  EU  level  data  collected  at  national  level,  e.g.  as  done  by  BEREC  for  international ","2072":"If  you  consider  that  there  is  a  need  for  a  specific  regulatory  authority  to  enforce  dedicated \nrules referred to questions 3, 5 and 9 respectively, would in your view these rules need to be \nenforced by the same regulatory authority or could they be enforced by different regulatory \nauthorities? Please explain your reply. ","2073":"BEREC considers that even though these are different types of enforcement, the underlying \nprinciples are the same, which justifies that the same regulatory body should be responsible \nin  both  cases.  In  this  respect,  BEREC  refers  to  the  experience  in  the  field  of  ECS  where \nNRAs  are  effectively  responsible  for  both  types  of  enforcement  in  the  application  of  the \nEuropean ECS Framework (e.g. regarding end-users\u2019 rights\/numbering\/general authorisation ","2074":"In  any  case,  as  explained  in  the  reply  to  Q2  on  Regulation  of  large  online  platform \ncompanies  acting  as  gatekeepers,  BEREC  considers  that  the  competent  regulatory  body \nshould  be  determined  depending  on  whether  the  case  at  hand  occurs  at  (i)  level  1  (more \nthan  three  MS\u2019  involved),  (ii)  level  2  (two  or  three  MS\u2019  involved)  or  (iii)  level  3  (national \nimpact only). In general, the EURB would be responsible for level-1 cases (with the option to \ndelegate  the  enforcement  to  the  NRBs  on  a  case-by-case  basis),  while  the  JT  of  NRBs \nwould be involved in level-2 cases and the respective NRBs for level-3 cases. ","2075":"BEREC also considers that privacy rules have a clear and important economic impact within \nthe  digital  environment.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  GDPR  is  essentially  based  on \nfundament  rights  of  individuals  and  not  designed  to  solve  economic  issues.  Nonetheless, \nremedies  should  take  account  of  other  existing  EU  regulations  with  respect  to  the  digital \nlandscape in order to ensure legal certainty.  ","2076":"In  addition  to  this,  it  is  also  expected  that  the  DSA  Package  will  outline  cooperation \nmechanisms with other authorities coping with digital ecosystems. The EURB, AB and NRBs \nshould in any case coordinate their activities with other authorities responsible for defining or \nimplementing  sector  specific rules,  insofar  as  the  respective rules might affect  one  another \nand insofar as the respective laws allow for such coordination. Providing for the possibility of \ncooperation  between  the  AB  and  similar  bodies  or  groups  associating  or  coordinating ","2077":"Regulatory  flexibility  will  be  important,  especially  in  regards  to  level  2  and  level  3  cases, \nwhilst  at the  same  it  will  be  necessary to  avoid  regulatory  uncertainty.  A rigid  stipulation  of \nregulations  which  may  be  in  conflict  with  measures  stemming from  the  DSA  Package may \nraise  problems  when  regulating  platforms  with  business  profiles  that  were  not  foreseen  by \nlawmakers. Also, with regards to the model of coordination of regulatory activities at national \nlevel,  MSs  should  be  in  a  position  to  allocate  competences  to  the  relevant  bodies. \nRegulators responsible for individual sectors already exist, as well as those whose authority \nis not restricted to one sector.  ","2078":"Cross-sectorial cooperation between institutions at both national and European level should \nbe envisaged at all stages of proceedings to determine the remedies to be imposed on the \nDPs with SIP and also their enforcement and monitoring. While monitoring the effectiveness \nof  established  regulatory  intervention,  the  ability  to  consult  on  observed  behaviour  of  DPs \nwith SIP with bodies which have different competences and legal perspectives may help to \ndecide whether it is necessary to maintain, amend or repeal imposed remedies. ","2079":"Many  different  features  in  the  digital  environment  (see  Q2  on  Main  features  of  gatekeeper \nonline  platform  companies)  can  raise  both  economic  and  societal  concerns  (see  Q11  and \nQ13  on  Emerging  issues).  Based  on  the  experience  in  regulating  ECS,  BEREC  considers \nthat the proposed rules can and should have the objective to address both types of effects.  ","2080":"The ex-ante experience in the ECS sector, aimed to reach a variety of objectives, shows that \nsociety  can  benefit  from  a  holistic  approach.  In  many  cases,  regulatory  tools  are  used  to \nreach several different objectives. For example, the EECC aims to cover several objectives, \nsuch as the development of the internal market, protection of end-users\u2019 rights, competition, \ndeployment and take-up of VHCN and end-to-end connectivity.  ","2081":"In  applying  an  ex-ante  regulatory  toolbox,  NRAs  have  experience  in  using  targeted \nregulation to achieve multiple effects. One example is number portability, which encourages \ncompetition, while at the same time, benefits consumers. BEREC thinks that this approach \ncould be also applied to ex-ante regulation of DPs with SIP. In addition, it can sometimes be \ndifficult  to  disentangle  effects  of  a  precise  structural  or  specific  societal  feature.  As  an \nexample,  ensuring  internet  openness,  an  objective  in  the  scope  of  the  ECS  regulatory \nframework,  has  both  economic  (i.e.  on  competition  dynamics)  and  societal  (i.e. freedom  of \nchoice,  accessibility  of  public  services,  social  inclusion  or  freedom  of  expression) \nimplications.  ","2082":"A holistic approach is also relevant for the data-intensive business models of some DP with \nSIP.  Disproportionate  data  collection  might  be  a  signal  of  weak  competition,  especially  in \nbusiness  models  where  no  monetary  price  is  paid  for  the  service.  Therefore,  ex-ante \nremedies  aimed  at  increasing  competition  -  such  as,  for  example,  data  portability  or \ninteroperability  - might  in  some  cases  help  to  increase  end-users\u2019  protection.  By  promoting \nthe development of consumer-empowering tools, ex-ante regulations might do both: protect \nconsumers  and  enhance  competition.  Therefore,  BEREC  believes  that  considering  the \nholistic  impact  of  DPs  with  SIP  in  the  digital  environment,  the  data-intensive  business \nmodels used in this domain and the essential nature of some of the services they offer, ex-\nante  rules  should  consider  the  externalities  between  different  objectives  of  public  interest \n(competition, internet openness, end-users\u2019 rights, data protection) to be pursued. ","2083":"Firstly,  institutional  cooperation  between  the  EURB\/NRB  and  competition  authorities  would \nbe  required.  The  current  cooperation  scheme  between  NRAs  and  competition  authorities \ncan  be  considered  as  a good reference.  Moreover, the  complexity  and  variety  of  concerns \nrelated  to  DPs  requires  the  adoption  of  a  holistic  approach.  Hence,  the  establishment  of \ncollaboration channels (i.e. information flows, periodical meetings etc.) with other authorities \nwould  be  positive  for  the  consistency  and  effectiveness  of  DPs  with  SIP  regulation.  This ","2084":"For instance, if the regulatory body for DPs imposes any data sharing obligation, provisions \nin the GDPR should be an element to be taken into account and coordinated with the data \nprotection  authorities  (DPAs).  In  the  ECS  regulation,  as  a  way  of  example,  the  EECC \nencourages  collaboration  among  different  competent  authorities  about  issues  such  as  (i) \npromotion of lawful content in ECN and services (art. 24.3); (ii) co-location and sharing of the \nnetwork elements (art. 44.1); (iii) monitoring of retail tariffs within the scope of US obligations \n(art.  85.1);  (iv)  price  comparisons  for  general  users  (art.  103);  or  (v)  quality  of  service  (art. \n104).  ","2085":"In  general,  competition  concerns  and  societal  issues  related  to  DPs  with  SIP  are  often \nsimilar  across  EU.  In  consequence,  a pan-EU scope  would  in  most  cases  be  adequate for \nthe regulatory body. However, there could be some areas where national-level enforcement \nof these measures is preferable (See answer Q12 above).  ","2086":"Swift and effective cross-border cooperation and assistance across MSs is crucial to ensure \nconsistent  and  effective  enforcement,  and  also  to  detect  potential  competition  concerns.  In \nthis regard, the role of an AB can be very important. BEREC, with its role in ECS regulation \nacross  EU,  provides  a  tested  cooperation  model  that  ensures  a consistent  application  of  a \nregulatory framework. ","2087":"As  DPs  are  rapidly  evolving,  any  regulatory  body  in  charge  of  DPs  regulation  should  be \nhighly  flexible  and  have  the  ability  to  adapt  to  new  contexts  and  circumstances. \nThe experience  with  ongoing  market  monitoring  and  the  enforcement  of  ex-ante  measures \nshould be considered when selecting a potential regulatory body. Furthermore, both capacity \nbuilding  within  MSs  and  the  development  of  high-level  technical  capabilities  are  also  key \nelements for carrying out the missions of a regulatory body in an efficient manner (see Q 24 \nbelow), next to economic skills and legal expertise.  ","2088":"These characteristics would in general be similar, regardless the adoption of a model based \non  principle  based  dedicated  rules,  a  case-by-case  scheme  or  a  combination  of  these  two \napproaches. See BERECs answer to Q13 on Emerging issues, Q3 and Q5 on Regulation of \nlarge online platform companies acting as gatekeepers.  ","2089":"As explained in Q24 below, BEREC considers that supervision and enforcement tools such \nas  information  requests  (with  a  corresponding  obligation  to  respond),  monitoring  and \ninspection  powers,  reporting  obligations  and  dispute  resolution,  can  be  suitable  to  ensure \nappropriate  regulation  of  DPs  with  SIP.  Such  measures  would  allow  the  responsible \nregulatory body to gather, publish and share (in compliance with legislation concerning data \nprotection and business confidentiality) relevant information with stakeholders and users with \nthe  aim  of  increasing  user  empowerment  and  adjusting  regulatory  measures,  where \nnecessary  (data-driven  regulation,  see  Q10  above).  Moreover,  BEREC  believes  that  it  is \nimportant  to  combine  these  tools  with  the  complementary  legal  instruments  needed  to \nimpose penalties in case of infringement of enforcement measures.  ","2090":"Based  on  its  considerable  experience  regulating  the  ECS  sector,  which  shares  some  key \nstructural  features  and  competition  concerns  with  DPs  with  SIP,  BEREC  considers  that \nsupervision  and  enforcement  are  fundamental  to  correctly  assess  the  application  of  the \ncombined  approach  of  principle-based  obligations\/prohibitions  and  case-by-case  ex-ante \nremedies  on  DPs  with  SIP.  Moreover,  prior  to  imposing  any  case-by-case  remedy  on  DPs \nwith SIP, it is important to monitor and understand the evolution in the use of these DPs by \nconsumers  and  business  users  as  well  as  technical  and  economic  characteristics  shaping \nthese  services.  This  allows  for  an  adequate  identification  of  economic  and  societal  issues \narising and to design appropriate and proportionate remedies to address these concerns.  ","2091":"The technical complexity of DPs, powered by highly-specialised technologies using big data, \nmachine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI),  constantly  expand  DPs\u2019  data-driven \ncapabilities,  enriching  their  insights  and  control  of  the  different  domains  covered  by  each \nplatform  (or  its  ecosystem  where  applicable).  This  high-tech  environment  is  inherently \nassociated  with  deep  information  asymmetries  between  DPs  and  users,  competitors  and \npublic authorities. As a result, a highly technical regulatory body with significant powers and ","2092":"Following  regulatory  intervention  principles  as  in  the  ECS  sector,  BEREC  considers  that \nsupervision and enforcement tools such as information requests, monitoring, inspection and \ndispute resolution powers of regulatory bodies and reporting obligations applied to DPs with \nSIP, combined with complementary legal instruments needed to impose penalties in case of \ninfringements,  are  important.  These  powers  could  be  clearly  established  in  the  legislative \nframework applicable to the DPs with SIP.  ","2093":"However, the appropriate regulatory body\/ies should adequately modulate its application by \ndepending  on  various  aspects,  as  competition  concerns,  market  dynamics,  type  of \nstakeholders involved, end- and business-users\u2019 interest and of ex-ante measures already in \nplace,  in  order  to  avoid  an  ineffective,  excessive  or  inefficient  regulation.  Reporting \nobligations  to  collect  information  would  vary  depending  on  these  conditions.  Different \nmeasures could be implemented, such as specific reporting about updates to the terms and \nconditions to enhance transparency towards business users, or providing information about \nhow and what type of data is collected and exploited, in order to empower end-users, as well \nas  relevant  supervisory-related  KPIs  reporting  (e.g.  denials  of  access  to  business  users, \nnumber  of  end-user\/business  user  complaints).  The  experience  of  NRAs  applying \nsupervision  and  monitoring  tools  in  the  ECS  sector  can  be  as  a  good  source  for  best \npractices for the regulatory framework towards DPs with SIP.

Please rate the policy options below from 1 (not effective) to 5 (most \neffective). ","2095":"BEREC favours this combined option because it calls for a regulatory framework which acts \nquickly and effectively rather than the mere enforcement of individual ex-ante measures. The \nex-ante  regulatory  framework  has  historically  proven  to  be  very  effective  in  monitoring \nevolving  markets.  In  sectors  where  technical  complexity  and  innovation  is  very  strong,  the \nability  to  continuously  share  information  between  regulators  and  relevant  players,  ensures \nflexibility and timely interventions. Moreover, ex-ante regulation has proven successful in the \nECS  sector  in  achieving  potentially  conflicting  objectives  in  the  long  term,  such  as \ncompetition  on  prices  (static  efficiency)  and  high  levels  of  investment  (dynamic  efficiency). \nThe ability to develop coherent and time-consistent regulatory schemes such as the \u201cladder \nof investment\u201d, has allowed ECS markets to achieve both objectives in the long term. In the \nDP  environment,  a similar  ex-ante  approach  could  be  equally  effective.  Therefore,  BEREC \nfavours  a  consistent  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  for  DPs.  Option  1  and  4  as  standalone \noptions are not considered. ","2096":"If  the  regulatory  proposals  formulated  by  BEREC  for  DPs  with  SIP  were  adopted,  BEREC \nconsiders that the NCT (option 4) should not overlap with this proposed ex-ante regulatory \nframework,  and  that  the  latter  should  be  the  applicable  legislation  (lex  specialis  principle). \nLike in the ECS sector, such a regulatory framework for DPs with SIP can be adapted in an \nefficient,  tailored  and  consistent  manner.  It  provides  a  scheme  for  predictable  and  timely \nintervention  to  address  the  identified  competition  problems,  while  creating  the  means  to \npursue a variety of objectives, in order to also address wider societal concerns. For a more \nelaborative  view  on  the  NCT,  please  see  BEREC\u2019s  position  paper  on  the  NCT  public \nconsultation.  ","2097":"Publication of information resulting from supervision and enforcement activities towards DPs \nwith SIP carried out by regulatory bodies at EU or\/and national level is fundamental, both for \ntransparency  purposes  regarding  regulatory  activity,  and  to  share  information  with  other \nsectorial-specific  competent  bodies  and  promote  a  common  regulatory  approach  to  foster \nthe development of the European internal market.  ","2098":"Aside from periodic reports at both national and EU level with key data (AoB, geographical \narea of service provision, number of unique users, etc.) about the DPs with SIP, publication \nof  regulatory  measures  and  transparency  about  disputes  resolution  cases  would  be  highly \nvaluable.  This  information  sharing  would  increase  the  transparency  across  competent \nregulatory  bodies  in  the  EU,  helping  to  consolidate  the  internal  market  and  increase \nconsumer  protection  throughout  the  EU.  Furthermore,  the  consultation  and  transparency \nmechanisms  set  out  in  the  ECS  regulatory  framework  prior  to  the  adoption  of  regulatory \nmeasures, could be considered a good practice applicable to the DP with SIP\u2019s regulation. ","2099":"Besides  transparency  vis-\u00e0-vis  public  bodies,  asymmetry  of  information  between  DPs  and \nbusiness  users  and  end-users  is  a  key  challenge.  To  tackle  this  information  asymmetry, \nnotwithstanding  requirements  on  transparency  set  in  the  P2B  regulation  for  all  platforms11, \nBEREC  advocates  for  promoting  greater  transparency  for  DPs  with  SIP,  by  means  of \ninformation  gathering  and  sharing  with  business  users  and  end-users  about  the  terms  and \nconditions imposed (transparency obligation). By increasing their awareness about the type \nof data and use done by DPs with SIP, consumers can be empowered. Information sharing \ncan  also  broaden  and  enhance  the  quality  and  innovation  of  the  services  offered  to  end-\nusers.  Fostering  data-driven  regulation  by  means  of  the  publication  of  data,  e.g.  providing \ncomparison  tools,  as  well  as  the  publication  of  information  on  complaints,  best  practices \nguidelines  such  as complaint  and  redress mechanisms for  business  users  could  be  further \nconsidered.  ","2100":"If implemented within an existing regulatory framework, the NCT could potentially serve as a \ncomplementary tool in exceptional cases not currently addressed by sectoral regulation. For \ninstance,  market  investigations,  as  potentially  considered  under  the  NCT,  may  be  used  to \ngather relevant  knowledge  and  adapt future  regulation  in  a  harmonised and  coherent  way. \nHowever,  BEREC  believes  that  this  tool  would  be  more  efficient  if  carried  out  by  the \ncompetent regulatory authorities (potentially in cooperation with competition authorities), who \nhave the relevant experience in the field.  ","2101":"Secondly,  concerning  the  regulatory  intervention  towards  DPs,  BEREC  considers  that  the \nex-ante  regulatory  framework  proposed  in  its  response  to  the  public  consultation  on  the \nDigital  Services  Act  (DSA)  Package  is  better  suited  to  address  structural  and  behavioural \nconcerns  raised  by  DPs  with  Significant  Intermediation  Power  (SIP).  Moreover,  BEREC \nbelieves that this proposed regulatory framework is not interchangeable with the NCT, as the \nlatter has a much broader scope than the ex-ante regulatory intervention considered in the \nDSA public consultation, even when the scope of the NCT is limited to digital services, which \nare in any case broader than DPs with SIP. Building on its expertise, BEREC believes that \nthe  regulatory  framework  for  ECS  has  been  successful  because  a  well-defined  scope  and \nrelevant  criteria  related  to  specific  markets  are  set  as  a  prerequisite  for  intervention.  This \napproach is more difficult to be applied by a general tool with a broader scope. ","2102":"The  regulatory  framework  for  ECS,  extensively  applied  over  the  last  twenty  years,  has \nproven  successful  in  addressing  structural  problems  and  enabling  a  competitive  and \ninnovative ECS sector in Europe. For two decades, the framework has continued to evolve \nin order to address new concerns and regulation has been lifted in markets where it was no \nlonger necessary.  ","2103":"Furthermore,  this  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  \u2013  including  the  European  Electronic \nCommunications  Code  (EECC)  and  other  relevant  regulations,  such  as  those  on  Open \nInternet  and  on  Roaming  \u2013,  is  also  successful  because  it  is  not  only  aimed  at  addressing \nstructural competition issues, but also at reaching a variety of broader objectives (ensuring \nconnectivity and internet openness, protecting end-users\u2019 rights, and so on), that can neither ","2104":"If the ECS sector were to fall within the scope of the NCT, then this complementarity would \nalso  need  to  be  ensured.  A  conflict  between  ECS  regulation  and  the  NCT  could  result  in \ninconsistent application of ex-ante regulation, forum shopping by market actors and potential \nregulatory  uncertainty  on  whom,  how  and  under  which  circumstances  a  market  actor  is \nsubject to regulation. This legal uncertainty could have serious implications for investment in \na dynamic and competitive sector.  ","2105":"For this reason, BEREC considers that, if the NCT is to be implemented including the ECS \nsector in its scope, the principle of lex specialis should apply, and the regulatory framework \nfor  ECS  should  be  the  applicable  legislation.  This  implies  that  any  structural  issue  already \nconsidered  in  the  ECS framework  should  be  addressed  applying  this framework  only. This \nframework  is  specialised  for  the  ECS  sector,  allowing  for  a  comprehensive  and  consistent \napplication  of  tailored  remedies,  reaching  a  variety  of  objectives,  setting  a  scheme  for \ninteractions  with  stakeholders  and  providing  predictability  and  consistency  throughout  the \nEU.  ","2106":"Furthermore, BEREC believes that, given its two-decade experience in the sector, regulatory \nauthorities  for  the  ECS  sector  are  in  an  optimal  position  (as  they  are  already  doing  so)  to \ncarry  out  an  analysis  aimed  at  identifying  structural  competition  concerns  in  the  ECS \nmarkets  which  are  not  currently  addressed  by  the  EECC.  If  the  need  for  further  regulatory \nintervention was identified in this sector, namely structural competition issues which are not \ncurrently addressed by the EECC, then the NRAs, applying the subsidiarity principle, should \nbe  empowered  with  the  appropriate,  necessary  tools  and  competences,  in  order  to  ensure \nan  effective  and  consistent  implementation  of  the  EECC,  adapted  to  the  specific \ncircumstances  of  their  national  markets.  This  could  be  done  by  a  revision  of  the  existing \nframework or by assigning the power of applying the NCT in the ECS sector to the NRAs in \norder to avoid an overlap in competences between different authorities. ","2107":"In  the  past,  BEREC  has  raised  proposals  to  address  structural  issues  in the  context  of the \nevolution  of  the  EECC,  specifically  in  relation  to  optimising  the  analysis  of  joint-dominance \n(based  on  tacit  collusion  also  addressed  in  the  EECC)  or  the  consideration  of  unilateral \neffects12.  If  the  NCT  were  implemented,  BEREC  considers  that  the  most  adequate  legal \nframework  to  address  these  issues  is  the  EECC  and  that  these  proposals  should  be \nconsidered as a complementary piece of the ex-ante regulatory framework to be applied by \nNRAs.  ","2108":"The same reasoning applies to the proposed ex-ante regulatory framework for DPs with SIP. \nAs detailed in the BEREC response to the public consultation on the DSA Package, BEREC \nconsiders  that  an  ex-ante  regulatory  framework  targeting  DPs  with  SIP  can  address  the \nstructural and specific issues raised by these platforms.  ","2109":"If  the  regulatory  proposals  formulated  by  BEREC  for  DPs  with  SIP  were  adopted,  BEREC \nconsiders that the NCT should not overlap with this proposed ex-ante regulatory framework, \nand that the latter should be the applicable legislation (lex specialis principle). As in the case \nfor  the  ECS  sector,  such  a  regulatory  framework  for  DPs  with  SIP  can  be  adapted  in  an \nefficient,  tailored  and  consistent  manner.  It  provides  a  scheme  for  predictable  and  timely \nintervention  to  address  the  identified  competition  problems,  while  creating  the  means  to \npursue a variety of objectives and to address wider societal concerns.  ","2110":"We sell travel-related products through dedicated branded websites and through dedicated branded mobile apps, for each of the brands mentioned above (see question 3).We are heavily dependent on search engines (Google Search, Yahoo, Bing) for user traffic acquisition through SEM (using namely in particular Google Ads, Google Ad Manager) and SEO optimization (linked in particular to Google Analytics and Google Search Console).","2111":"We also use digital services provided by third party providers such as license for SEM optimization and have commercial partnerships with digital providers regarding some travel-related products \nFrom our experience, the features we have ranked above as \u201cvery important\u201d contribute in a critical manner to create structural competition problems that are stifling innovation, decreasing choice for consumers and damaging markets. ","2112":"B - Vertical integration:\nMore precisely, in the flight ticket distribution market, most online businesses such as online travel agents (OTA) and metasearch engines (MSE) are heavily reliant on Google Search for a material portion of user traffic, be it organic or paid. In many cases, customers begin their journey with Google Search. This control of the top of the customer purchase funnel, in addition to vertical integration, enables Google to act as a bottleneck, by e.g., diverting traffic from OTAs and MSEs to the benefit of its own vertical search products. Google Search controls access from customers to digital providers through the ranked results it displays each time a search is made  (it enjoys the \u201cgatekeeper position\u201d through which consumers access specialized search services). \nIn addition to operating the upstream generic search engine Google Search, Google also operates the downstream Google Flights which is a specialized search engine;\nthis vertical integration is exploited by Google by giving self preferencing\/preferential treatment to its downstream product\/service on the result page: Google\u2019s downstream products systematically benefits from a guaranteed high ranking above organic results, guaranteed by their control of the upstream Google Search (in our example Google Flights, but this is true for other services such as Google Hotel Finder, Google Vacation Rental, Google Shopping\u2026)\nThis vertical integration leads to damageable structural effects on competition by deterring innovation and depriving consumers from choice and quality.","2113":"G - Information asymmetry:\nWe consider Google implements information asymmetry vis a vis consumers by not making it clear to them that its downstream products\/services contain commercial information and are not indeed suggested by pure relevance to the results. This confusion is exploited by Google to generate more traffic towards its own products\/services to the detriment of relevant competing products\/services. We also believe that Google is blurring labels on its result pages so that consumers are more likely to click on paid communication than organic\/relevant information.\nex: Google does not clearly label Google Flights licensed results as commercial communication. As a result, studies show that users confuse Google Flights as unbiased and purely relevance-based generic search results and, consequently, do not make informed decisions when taking \"information\" on this platform. ","2114":"P - Zero pricing markets. \nGoogle has been enjoying for years  a +90% market share across the general online search services market, yet its price to consumers remains at zero. \nWe consider Google is abusing this dominant position to benefit Google Flights, damaging competition of the flight search service market. Through tying Google Flights with Google Search, Google ensures that Google Flights is as ubiquitous on the Internet as Google Search. No other distribution mechanism, combination of distribution mechanisms or traffic source attains this universal availability. The market developments are thus tipping in favor of Google Flights.  Consumers \u2013 and their behavioral biases \u2013 are exploited because in return for their valuable user data (which is their \u201cconsideration\u201d for the otherwise \u201cfree\u201d search services) they do not receive what was promised to them \u2013 the most relevant results at the most prominent position of the general search results pages.Based on our experience, the market scenarios we have ranked above as \u201cvery important\u201d qualify as serious structural competition problems that we believe have a damageable effect on competition and on consumer welfare, by reducing innovation and choice, hence, higher prices for consumers. ","2115":"Anti-competitive monopolization: we can refer to Google abusing its dominant position by prominently ranking its own flight comparison platform Google Flights, over all other flight search results for personal benefit. At a glance, Google\u2019s abusive conduct is inducing the exclusion of competitors and is therefore harming consumer welfare. We consider Google is restricting the capacity of its competitors to develop innovative products. OTAs add value to the flight-distribution market by creating customer-centric innovative products. By eradicating the competition on merit, we believe Google is damaging this innovation ability, and thus the choice and quality of products consumers have access to. ","2116":"Gatekeeper scenarios: like many other sectors, the online travel sector has grown heavily dependent on \u2013 and exposed to the problematic conduct of some gatekeepers, in particular of Google. At the same time, our concerns are not necessarily limited to Google. Rather, Google\u2019s practices should be regarded as examples of how a large online firm may use its gatekeeping role to gain anti-competitive advantage in new markets and\/or entrench its position on existing markets. Due to their gatekeeper position, customers typically predominantly use one service provider\/platform (single-home) and cannot easily switch, which results in more barriers to entry.\n \nTipping markets: We observe Google fills the criteria of a winner takes most market as it uses its gatekeeper role to further cement its market power and conquer new markets, as well as  exploiting users behavioural biases and also imposing unfair conditions on its business customers (e.g., excessive intermediation fees, excessive data extraction).\n*For these scenarios, please refer to Q6 as well for all the examples we have provided regarding Google. ","2117":"Highly concentrated markets: looking at air transport, the phenomenon of increasing concentration through the constitution of large groups (AF\/KLM\/Delta, IAG, Lufthansa\u2026 more recently Air Canada\/Air Transat..) is a critical factor for structural competition problems as we observe parallel similar restricting behaviors (such as marketing restrictions on competing travel agents). The access to the airline distribution market is significantly restricted by the cumulative negative effect of these restrictions - allowed by a highly concentrated market.We see this is common in digital markets for players with significant market power that are able to act as gatekeepers and extend their dominance to adjacent markets;  Google is an example of diversification (thanks to its dominant position on general search) in the travel area in particular by operating Google Flights, Google Maps\/Hotel Finder, Google Trips, Destination, Vacation Package, Touring Bird...Yes, as detailed above, the competition concerns we are facing due to leveraging strategies are mainly: ","2118":"1) Self-preferencing - namely using market power in one market to favor their position in an adjacent or related market at the expense of their rivals, e.g., by giving preferential treatment to their own products and services (clear example of this harmful practice is Google placing its vertical products such as Google Flights and Google Hotels more favorably above all higher ranked organic results, hence, discounting organic results in favor of its own travel products); ","2119":"2) Bundling - the tying of two distinct products  by a dominant operator have already been condemned by the authorities (Microsoft case strong precedent). We see similar practices implemented by Google (i.e. Google Search and Google Flights technically integrated as one):i t is not possible for consumers to disable or avoid Google Flights when they run a flight-related search through Google Search. This practice reduces the incentives to innovate.Yes, there is an absolute need for the Commission's intervention in these situations considering the fast-evolving nature of digital markets and their tendency to (irreversibly) tip. We are supportive for the Commission to intervene to tackle these situations of extension of market power into related markets but subject to very strict conditions (e.g. when the repeated leveraging strategy is implemented by a gatekeeper marketplayer). \nThis intervention could take the shape of cease and desist orders and\/or interim measures.\nArticles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are suitable but not sufficiently effective in the current state of the market. Precedents have shown that there is a particularly important obstacle to effectiveness which is the investigation duration to assess markets and suspected practices required by the implementation by these articles. Such timing may contribute to irreparable damage made to market as the digital sectors are fast evolving.In the travel sector we experience Google who quickly gained a critical position in specialized (travel) search services.\nFor several years now we have been facing Google\u2019s strategy to expand its dominance in the market for general search services into the market for travel search services such as Google Flights, Google Hotel Finder and Google vacation rentals.","2120":"Google\u2019 strategy to enter these markets is to give self-preference to its products by allocating them a guaranteed rank and eye-catching format on the first result page of any travel-related search. This abusive expansion of dominance has already been condemned in the Google Shopping case, and in the sector of travel is even more detrimental to competition as such conduct not only fulfills an abusive favoring of a separate service, it also fulfills the long-established criteria of the Court for an abusive tying of separate services. These practices have been reported to DG COMP through different channels.","2121":"Yes, we believe this is common at least from Google as we have been observing strong and quick gain of market shares in the following markets:\nShopping\nJobs\nFlights\nAccomodation\nVacation rentals \nIn destination\nAdvertising\nnews publishing\nSelf-preferencing: we observe Google is using its market power in one market (general search services) to favor its position in an adjacent market (specialised search services) at the expense of its rivals by giving preference to its own products and services. This diverts the majority of the traffic to Google Flights and away from its more relevant competitors. This deprives consumers from fair full information allowing them to do informed choices and benefit from innovative products","2122":"Confusion between paid and organic results: We believe that Google does not clearly label its products results as commercial information, distorting the searcher\u2019s  information and its relevance.\n \nAnti-competitive foreclosure: We consider Google\u2019s conduct is having a massive detrimental effect on the industry, as it restricts competition and will ultimately lead to less choice, less innovation and higher prices for consumers. ","2123":"There is a need for the Commission to intervene in such situations of anti-competitive monopolization, e.g. with the imposition of interim measures and making use of them as such measures appear indispensable to ensure effectiveness of the outcome of any investigation and final decision, at least in cases where there is an urgency (e.g. our Google Flights case outlined above) due to the risk of serious irreparable harm to competition. ","2124":"To this end, we believe the Commission should adopt a threshold for interim measures that is lower than the one currently contained at Article 8(1) of  Regulation 1\/2003, which requires a \u201cprima facie\u201d finding of infringement and an urgent need for interim measures to avert the risk of \u201cserious and irreparable\u201d damage to competition. ","2125":"Also, market investigation powers similar to the CMA, with the ability to undertake market studies that considers the potential risks to the health of a given market and make binding recommendations to tackle such anti-competitive monopolizationArticles 101 and 102 have not been sufficiently effective to tackle anti-competitive monopolization, in particular because of 1) time: process is lengthy, resource intensive, spanning several years. Thus, by the time investigation has concluded, the market may have tipped in favor of the investigated undertaking as a result of its anti-competitive conduct in the market, making it extremely difficult to restore competition; 2)  lack of enforcement and lack of holistic approach between law principles, i.e. GDPR, consumer protection, competition law issues.","2126":"The examples above prove to be true in the case of Google; it seems Google is abusing its dominance across the general online search services market by self-preferencing its own flight comparison platform, Google Flights over all other flight search results for personal benefit. Even though complaints have been lodged with the Commission over Google\u2019s conduct since 2012, its conduct has even worsened and continues unchecked today.In the airline ticket distribution market, see example provided in Q7.1 above.High concentration levels are prevalent in the airline industry, which has experienced consolidation due to a wave of mergers forming large groups of carriers (AF\/KLM\/Delta, IAG, Lufthansa\u2026 more recently Air Canada\/Air Transat..) that can significantly increase the risk of tacit collusion. ","2127":"From a travel agent standpoint, such a high degree of concentration raises concerns as any concentration operation in the airline industry diminishes leveraging negotiation power towards airlines. Also, it increases the likelihood of alignment on restricting behaviors (such as marketing restrictions now commonly imposed on travel agents), leading to a cumulative effect to the detriment of consumers' choice and access to fair prices. ","2128":"The impact of such restrictions is substantial: brand bidding and redistribution restrictions are the most significant measures of marketing airlines tickets for OTAs. Reduced visibility of OTAS has a knock-on effect on the level of transparency on the market and as a consequence, the prices paid by consumers. OTAs bring consumers innovations in the form of new relevant products (such as virtual interlining and cross faring) that are not available from airlines. These constant attempts by airlines to impose trade restrictions on OTAs impede such innovation to the detriment of consumers which risk being deprived of innovative products and better deals, in violation of EU competition rules.","2129":"Google in general search marketThe above market features contribute to protecting a market and enforce the barriers to entry. There is already evidence of how dominant platforms use their gatekeeper role to further entrench their market power and conquer new markets, as well as to impose unfair conditions on their business customers (e.g., excessive intermediation fees, excessive data extraction). Once a market has tipped in their favor, it becomes extremely difficult for new entrants to displace them. This stifles innovation and harms consumers. The travel sector is no exception, as it has grown heavily dependent on \u2013 and exposed to the problematic conduct of \u2013 one of these gatekeepers, namely Google.\nThe markets for digital services are generally concentrated and dominated by a few very large digital platforms, in particular the GAFAs (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon). Their long lasting dominance and persistent leveraging strategies (e.g. self-preferencing, exploitation of network effects, tying) ultimately leads to an abuse of dominance by foreclosing rivals and deterring entry to the detriment of consumer welfare and innovationConsumers face serious harm as a result of this lack of competition. The negative impacts suffered by businesses are then passed to consumers. Therefore, consumers face reduced innovation and quality, less choice and also limited control over data. Consumers also may pay higher prices for products and services across the economy. ","2130":"\nAs mentioned above, the GAFAs group of companies: Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon\nGoogle on general search, display advertising, mobile operating systems (android) and mailing services (gmail)\nApple on electronic products, multiple online services (app store) and mobile operating systems (iOS)\nFacebook on social media\nAmazon on ecommerce (online retail marketplace)","2131":"Data cross-usage: the ability to internally combine and use data across products and services may enable a platform  to engage in \u201cenvelopment\u201d strategies aimed at conquering new markets through cross-subsidization. This is illustrated by the Google Flights service which Google does not monetize by charging a fee, but by collecting data that it will monetize through search or display ads.","2132":"Please refer to the competition concerns listed above in Q18.8.There is a need for early and effective interventions to prevent irreversible damage in the market caused due to such gatekeeper scenarios. Intervention based on competition law alone may not be sufficient to address and deter anti-competitive conduct by large dominant platforms. ","2133":"For example in the case of Google, while initially the Commission took issue with Google using its dominance in search to favor a number of its verticals, including travel, it eventually only addressed one of the affected verticals, namely comparison shopping services in the case AT.39740 \u2013 Google Search (Shopping). In the meantime, Google has been free to engage in abusive practices that are comparable to, and have created consumer harm of the order of, the conduct condemned in Google Shopping in order to favor its travel verticals. We consider Google\u2019s conduct worsened and continues today.Ex-post enforcement (Articles 101 and 102) is not always sufficient to tackle anti-competitive practices by gatekeeper platforms. Competition investigations are resource-intensive and lengthy, often market players have departed the industry and competition may be extremely hard to restore. Often the remedies imposed do little to facilitate the restoration of competition, as we saw in the comparison shopping space where the Google Shopping decision has had little positive effect on competition.\nWe believe that existing ex post enforcement should be complemented by ex ante rules to preserve market competitiveness. Ex ante rules could address certain limitations of antitrust enforcement, ensuring EU markets remain fair and contestable to the benefit of consumers.we don't identify a sector that could not be subject to structural competition problems by nature","2134":"We can bring forth one particular situation: the marketing restrictions imposed by several major airlines on travel agents, which have been reported numerous times, and no action from the Commission followed suit.In the airline ticket distribution market we observe restricting behaviours such as marketing restrictions imposed on travel agents as mentioned above.As of today the most critical issue is not identifying or catching the abusive conduct of dominant platforms (the authorities seem to already have the tools to do so: see Google, Microsoft, Facebook cases\u2026) but it is about the timing of the investigation, the identification of adequate remedies, the enforcement resources of competition authorities. \nTherefore, article 102 has shown to be insufficient and ineffective to tackle structural competition problems such as anti-competitive monopolization, leveraging strategies to extend market power in adjacent markets, gatekeeper scenarios. Hence, the need for complementary ex ante rules to prevent irreversible damage to the structure of the market. \nFor example, as mentioned above, in the Google Shopping case, the remedies implemented have not proven to be satisfactory as of today and we consider Google\u2019s conduct has worsened and continues today.in the airline ticket distribution market and travel market as broadArticles 101 and 102 are effective tools ex post enforcement, but may not be the most effective way to tackle certain structural competition problems currently. Competition investigations are extremely resource-intensive and lengthy to address issues in a timely manner. Therefore, we support the new competition tool (NCT) to act as a complement to traditional competition enforcement by addressing certain limitations with early intervention where Articles 101 and 102 would take too long and there is a significant risk of irreversible damage to competition, in order to ensure EU markets remain fair and contestable to the benefit of consumers.  ","2135":"An additional concern we have lies in the overlap between the ex ante regulation for gatekeeper platforms (DSA) and the NCT. The Commission needs to provide clarity on the articulation between these two.In order to prevent the structural competition problems aforementioned in Q24.1, we would welcome that the NCT allows monitoring market investigations for certain markets where criteria are met (oligopoly, presence of gatekeeper, high transparency...) This would tackle the problem of timing of investigations which are extremely lengthy and resource intensive. ","2136":"We believe the NCT should be agnostic and applicable to every situation where there is market failure that cannot be effectively redressed by traditional competition law enforcement (Articles 101 and 102) as opposed to focusing only on dominant platforms (which, as per our understanding, will be covered by ex ante regulation).","2137":"The scope of the NCT should be agnostic as mentioned above and consist of a market structure-based competition tool with a horizontal scope applicable to all undertakings in the market.As mentioned above, we believe the NCT constitutes an opportunity for all competition issues, whatever the sectors (not only digital), to be resolved through new effective solutions.","2138":"Markets such as the flight ticket distribution market, hotel room bookings distribution market, and any travel related service\/product are prone to be digitised and equally affected. \nWe are supportive of recommendation powers and imposition of remedies (such as interim measures) provided by the NCT that would lead to quick, binding and effective solutions to the structural competition issues.As mentioned above, we are supportive of any type of remedies that would lead to quick, binding and effective solutions to bring the structural competition issues to an end. ","2139":"\nYes, if no other less radical remedies can be found to prevent irreparable harm to competition. This should be considered as the ultimate remedy to be implemented. Nevertheless, in certain cases divestment may prove to be necessary in situations where restoration of competition is not possible and effective remedies could not be implemented (e.g. Google Shopping case, as well as other similar Google verticals) ","2140":"Yes, we are supportive that the NCT requires adequate investigative powers before designing tailored remedies (such as the UK CMA\u2019s market investigative powers to issue binding recommendations after in-depth investigation). This can contribute to identifying correctly the structural competition issues at stake and achieve more efficient solutions.The issue the NCT would tackle with extended investigative powers is the ability to increase the knowledge and experience of Commission\u2019s staff on various markets in order to reduce ex post market investigation or even allow ex ante intervention.Benefits: legal security for companies subject to competition law\nDrawbacks: no identified\nTypes of deadlines: answer is broad as it depends on the types of tools the NCT will cover. Each measure (recommendation, remedy..)should be issued in a timeframe that gives it full efficiency and relevance, in particular when a recommendation takes into account a particular context\/market situation\nYes, we support that the NCT include the possibility to impose interim measures.

Therefore, we are familiar with these elements to a large extent. We have seen the said platform attempt to leverage its dual role, strong market position and access to large sets of valuable customer data to launch its own similar service. BCG believes such elements are likely to increase the severity of anti-competitive effects of  EU competition law infringements.","2146":"We select the elements A, C-E, G-M, O-P as \u2018Somewhat important\u2019, as BCG has yet to meaningfully experience such elements first-hand in its markets. Although we agree that, in theory, the individual or combined effect of these elements could limit competition in markets, we do not have enough experience to comment on these issues extensively. BCG has not come across these elements, as its core market has multiple players with varying business models, and therefore, a healthy amount of competition is always present.

We strongly believe that markets should develop naturally to overcome such features, as the risk of intervention, on balance, risks of disincentivising innovation. Last, if such features evolve into genuine competition issues and are not fixed through natural market development, we believe that these issues, rising to the extremes of actually harming competition on a significant scale, can be resolved by the use of existing competition tools: Article 101, 102 TFEU and the EU Merger Regulation.We select items 1-2 (market power extension to related markets; anti-competitive monopolisation) as being \u2018Very important\u2019. This is because we have had first-hand experience with similar situations, for example, when a digital platform with significant market power attempted to enter our business sector. This attempt was done through what we perceive as the platform\u2019s \u2018capacity to put competitors at a disadvantage unfairly\u2019, i.e. this digital platform leveraged its access to large sets of consumer data to rapidly acquire market shares. Although we agree that such situations (1,2) can rise to the extremes that gives rise to strong anti-competitive effects on markets, this does not necessitate the introduction of the NCT. In our view, such situations can be effectively remedied by diligent enforcement of Article 102 TFEU, and thus, BCG wishes to encourage the European Commission to use its discretion in enforcing the existing rulebook in an effective and timely manner. ","2149":"We select items 5-6 (gatekeeper scenarios; tipping markets) as \u2018Important\u2019. This is because, as of now, we have not experienced these market practices to a significant extent, but confirm that they could, under specific circumstances, lessen competition in other select markets. However, we find issue with the European Commission classifying these as \u2018structural competition problems\u2019.","2150":"First, these features are not commonplace, to be classed as actual \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 reducing competition. In relation to this, BCG would also like to point out that even the European Commission admitted in its documentation of this consultation that there is no settled answer on whether such \u2018structural competition issues\u2019 exist in markets at all. The absences of empirical evidence and market studies evidencing that such issues exist, the introduction of the NCT seems premature.","2151":"In relation to \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 (5), BCG takes the view that, although there are markets with platforms \/ companies that have consistently held onto a large user \/ consumer bases, these markets have remained competitive and open to the entry of new players. We believe that the presence of these large platforms does not necessarily restrict market entry. Rather, new players can enter the market through finding \u2018niche\u2019 \/ \u2018specialty\u2019 submarkets that cater to a specific user base, contesting parts of the user bases of entrenched players. For example, Facebook is arguably one of the largest social media platforms globally, however this has not deterred the entry of new, innovative social media platforms that manage to find or create their own niche area. E.g., TikTok has rapidly grown and managed to acquire even 800 million users, becoming a direct threat to Facebook. TikTok\u2019s growth has been immense, which shows that the digital services \/ digital entertainment space, despite having some entrenched players, is relatively fluid and has space on offer for innovative companies to later grow to the scale needed to contest a gatekeeper\u2019s market. Therefore, BCG does not perceive such situations as \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 that call for the introduction of NCT. ","2152":"In relation to \u2018tipping markets\u2019 (6), BCG would like to highlight to the European Commission that it appears that this phenomenon is closely related to, if not the same as, natural successful business growth, which should not be villainized by competition policy. Therefore, BCG requests the Commission to further clarify the difference between the phenomenon of \u2018tipping markets\u2019 and natural \/ healthy growth.","2153":"We select items 3-4 (highly concentrated markets; usage of algorithmic pricing) as \u2018No knowledge \/ No experience\u2019. As stated before, the Online Classifieds \/ e-commerce space, generally, is a dynamic area with a number of different players. The products offered in our core market \u2013 the Online Classifieds space \u2013 are not homogenous (i.e. they vary to a large extent) and are listed by users themselves (which personally determine the price). Therefore, from an end-user perspective, pricing algorithms are not relevant to our core market. This means BCG has no experience to draw from and speak about these elements.","2154":"To sum up our position, BCG believes that most, if not all, of the issues numbered 1-5 above are not that extreme to be qualified as \u2018structural competition problems\u2019. However, in case these issues emerge and are so extreme as to noticeably affect markets, BCG believes that Articles 101 and 102 give the European Commission sufficient legal power to address these issues \u2013 therefore, we welcome the European Commission to use its current powers for this purpose.Although BCG has been referring to an example that relates directly to the digital sector \/ market, we believe that many sectors are prone to such strategies. As stated in our answer to 8.2, market power extension strategies is a rational \/ efficient use of existing company assets \/ capital and may also deliver greater value to consumers. Therefore, we can observe such moves by companies in most sectors, not only the digital sector, which appears to be excessively scrutinised in this regard.In our experience, leveraging strategies can raise competition concerns. Of course, as stated above, such strategies are not limited to specific product characteristics and therefore not specific to the digital services, as the necessity to use existing company capital in rational and optimal ways pushes companies to use strategies. Also, when done by a non-dominant company, in a fair manner, such strategies can create \u2018healthy\u2019 competition in related markets, which encourages incumbent players to innovate and be more creative in improving its service \/ product offering.","2155":"However, when such leveraging strategies are pursued by internet giants, the playing field sometimes becomes unfair. This is especially true when such companies use various non-transparent methods to ensure they are successful in entering new markets. These methods can include various self-preferencing strategies, tying \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 products \/ services together etc. For example, in recent years it has come to our awareness that certain digital platforms were using self-preferencing strategies \u2013 using market power in their \u2018core\u2019 market to give an advantage to their own services \/ products in \u2018specialty\u2019 markets, also demoting competitors\u2019 services \/ products. This resulted in the platform successfully entering into a new market, whereas its competitors lost out. Therefore, BCG supports the use of existing competition tools, in this case Article 102 TFEU, to address these issues. The case law shows that similar conduct has previously been caught by Article 102 TFEU, meaning it is an adequate tool to deal with competition issues arising from such leveraging strategies.BCG agrees that the European Commission should intervene in situations where companies with market power use repeated strategies to extend their market position into related markets. However, as stated above, BCG believes that the European Commission already currently has the right to use Article 102 to deal with such situations, when they arise. ","2156":"Article 102 TFEU was designed to catch unilateral anti-competitive actions by dominant companies, such as the above described market power extension strategy. To introduce a new tool, to which no judicial precedent relates to, would undermine legal uncertainty, and simply be unjustified, considering that there are tried and tested competition tools, which can address such anti-competitive strategies. Therefore, BCG strongly supports the usage of Article 102 TFEU to address such market situations.In line with our answers above, the design of TFEU Article 102 is specifically aimed at addressing not what could be described in broad terms as mere competition imperfections or adverse market conditions, but indeed competition problems, causing direct harm to the competitive process and, from a long-term perspective, causing net negative effects to consumers     .","2157":"In this light, the use of ex ante rules in form of NCT to address anti-competitive market power extensions, could potentially disincentivise investments advancing innovation (see BCG\u2019s answer to question No 6 above).We have come across a situation in the digital services space where one market player attempted to enter into our core market through using large sets of data to create a similar service.Please see our answer to question No 8.2.","2158":"BCG agrees with the European Commission that anticompetitive monopolisation strategies do raise a variety of competition concerns. Using unfair business strategies to acquire a larger market share is problematic, as it distorts competition in the market. This can result in the foreclosure of competitors, and thus, lessening of product \/ service offering variety, innovation and creativity. Such actions ultimately result in reduction in consumer welfare.Continuing with our position stated above, BCG believes that anticompetitive monopolisation merits intervention by the European Commission. We believe this should be done through existing competition tools, namely Article 102 TFEU, as it was designed to catch such anticompetitive behaviour by dominant firms. We do not see a need to introduce the NCT to deal with anticompetitive monopolisation strategies, as it can be fully and efficiently dealt with under Article 102 TFEU.Depending on whether the anticompetitive monopolisation is done by one or more firms, BCG believes that such situations can be dealt with under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU respectively. These tools have been designed to address a plethora of forms of anticompetitive behaviour, whether it is done unilaterally or through coordination between firms: agreements, concerted practices and so on. ","2159":"BCG does not see a sufficient justification to enact the NCT. The way we see it, enacting a new competition tool would also inevitably create a number of issues, such as legal uncertainty due to lack of judicial precedent, the need to enact adequate procedural safeguards, the risk of overregulation and so on. Therefore, there should be clear and adequate justifications for introducing this tool.","2160":"We strongly believe in the European Commission\u2019s ability and preparedness to solve competition issues arising from anticompetitive monopolisation under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, depending on whether these actions are done multilaterally or by a single dominant undertaking. We base this belief in the fact that EU competition case law shows that similar behaviour has been previously caught and addressed by the European Commission\u2019s enforcement actions.","2161":"However, there is also another aspect to this \u2013 \u2018tipping\u2019 is not necessarily automatically a \u2018bad\u2019 market feature, as it can also bring about positive effects. First, \u2018tipping\u2019 markets are characterised by products \/ services whose value increases in line with the number of consumers using the same or compatible products \/ services. This means that \u2018tipping\u2019 can also have a positive effect, creating efficiencies, i.e. the larger the customer base of the platform is, the more value each user on the platform receives back.","2162":"Further, although \u2018tipping\u2019 can, under some circumstances, help create one entrenched market player, it can also present a growth opportunity for new entrants. Essentially, if there is a point at which there is fast growth (a \u2018critical threshold of customers\u2019), this means that firms are presented with an opportunity to grow, they just need to strive to reach the threshold of users that increases the value of their service \/ product offering, which can actually attract players wishing to enter the market.","2163":"Additionally, when assessing \u2018tipping markets\u2019, we would encourage the European Commission to also consider the present stage of the market\u2019s development cycle. If a market is new and growing, it is likely that it can support multiple players at once. Therefore, \u2018tipping\u2019 is not necessarily an issue in fast-growing markets, which are attracting many customers and market players. Rather, it should be seen as a natural market development cycle, which should run its course, as long as market players are not abusing their market position.In line with established economic and legal thinking and the precedents, we acknowledge the above mentioned market features as relevant for a \u2018tipping market\u2019.Please see our answer to question No 16.2. above.BCG has not had any significant first-hand experience with the competition concerns mentioned above, and therefore, cannot meaningfully comment on these effects \/ rate these effects.As per our answer to question No 16.2, we recognise the existence of \u2018tipping\u2019 in certain markets, specifically the digital services segment. However, we do not see the need for enacting the NCT to deal with such situations, as we believe that Article 102 TFEU is the most appropriate tool to deal with such situations, for the reasons stated below.","2164":"It is important to note that it is difficult to precisely define what \u2018tipping\u2019 is, when precisely a market will \u2018tip\u2019 towards a certain player, or whether the market is \u2018tipping\u2019 at all. What is seen as a \u2018tipping\u2019 scenario can also be mixed up with a market player\u2019s natural successful growth, or a sign of a natural market development cycle in fast-growing segments. Therefore, using ex-ante enforcement in form of the NCT to deal with \u2018tipping market\u2019 situations could be dangerous and could even inhibit natural market development cycles, as there is a chance that the intervened-into situation is not actually an anti-competitive \u2018tipping\u2019 situation. This would inevitably deter new market players from attempting to enter such markets.","2165":"Therefore, BCG strongly supports the activation of existing competition tools to deal with concerns relating to \u2018tipping markets\u2019. As Article 102 TFEU was designed to resolve unilateral anti-competitive behaviour by undertakings, BCG believes this tool can fully and efficiently deal with any material anti-competitive consequences arising from \u2018tipping market\u2019 situations.As per our answer to question 17.1., we believe Article 102 TFEU can fully and efficiently deal with any material anti-competitive consequences arising from \u2018tipping market\u2019 situations. Using Article 102 TFEU ensures that all necessary evidentiary thresholds are met. This means the European Commission, whilst using Article 102 TFEU, can always be sure that the market situation which is intervened into actually merits the intervention \/ requires remedies to be resolved. This is especially important considering the elusive definition \/ nature of the \u2018tipping\u2019 phenomenon. Thus, BCG believes that markets should be allowed to run their natural development course, whereas when anti-competitive behaviour arises, this should be dealt with under Article 102 TFEU.In the digital sectors\/markets, platforms compete with each other, aiming to have control over content which is necessary to conduct business, such as data on its users. The end result is that we observe certain large platforms which have the largest amount of traffic, and therefore, users. Also, as these platforms expand their services \/ products into related markets, they essentially become an unavoidable trading partner for their users due to being an efficient \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019. BCG recognises that this can result in platforms becoming what the European Commission defines as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 for other market players trying to enter the certain market.","2166":"BCG marks the indicated features as \u2018Very important\u2019 for qualifying a company as a gatekeeper due to these features being generally in line with established economic thinking. We agree that any undertaking, no matter whether it operates in the digital services sector or beyond, could be classed as a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 if it has the ability to control anything important \/ essential to other businesses: data, a large audience or input.","2167":"Yet, it is important to highlight that, from a legal standpoint, defining a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 as solely possessing the above mentioned features is flawed. This is because the listed features can be found in various undertakings and are very general \/ abstract in nature. Thus, we believe the European Commission should not rely on these features as characterising the legal definition of a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019, as this can be misleading.\nBCG is focused on the online classifieds segment and has not come across undertakings possessing \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 features in this segment.BCG does not see a need for the European Commission to intervene in gatekeeper scenarios to a larger extent than it already can under Article 102 TFEU, when such scenarios give rise to significant anti-competitive effects on markets.","2168":"First, as highlighted in in our answer to question 7.1., we take the view that the presence of large platforms (i.e. \u2018gatekeepers\u2019) does not automatically restrict market entry for other players. Various market situations point to companies still being able to enter markets through finding \u2018niche\u2019 \/ \u2018specialty\u2019 submarkets that cater to a specific user base (e.g. TikTok\u2019s rapid growth, despite the market being characterised by entrenched market players, such as Facebook). This strategy allows new entrants to grow and, over time, even contest the gatekeeper\u2019s market. This means that the European Commission should not always intervene in \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 scenarios, as they may represent a natural market development cycle after which various \u2018specialty\u2019 competitors appear, naturally shifting the market in a new direction.","2169":"Further, as the European Commission characterises \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 as being undertakings with a large user base, a focus on restricting such \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 situations could do harm on markets. This is because undertakings would limit innovating and improving their service \/ product offering to the extent that it attracts too large of a user base, in order to avoid regulation. This could result in an overall decrease in consumer welfare, which competition policy should stimulate, not the opposite.","2170":"BCG also believes it is important to note that \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 firms can create efficiencies in markets. Essentially, these firms usually acquire a large user base through offering the most attractive service \/ product to consumers. Artificially intervening into the natural course of such markets could do harm, cancelling out the said efficiencies. Therefore, BCG does not support the intervention into \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 scenarios to a larger extent than is already possible through Article 102 TFEU.","2171":"In addition to these \u2018gatekeeper-related\u2019 risks, there are further general risks. For example, introducing the NCT could lead to an overly complex framework which risks overregulating markets. An unclear EU competition policy \/ framework would deter market players from entry and undoubtably put the European businesses at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the world. Therefore, when it comes to \u2018gatekeeper-related\u2019 issues, BCG does not support the expansion of the European Commission\u2019s toolbox \u2013 we believe Article 102 TFEU is sufficient to address any anti-competitive outcomes stemming from \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 in markets.BCG considers that Article 102 TFEU has sufficient legal power and is appropriate to deal with anti-competitive outcomes related to \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 scenarios. We do not believe that the European Commission should try and extend the scope of its jurisdiction to intervene into situations beyond the abuse of dominance framework. In our view, firms should not be scrutinised by the European Commission for simply being \u2018gatekeepers\u2019, in the event they do not abuse this position (for our reasons see answer above to question No 19.1.). ","2172":"Therefore, we consider that Article 102 TFEU has sufficient legal power to preserve and improve competition in markets. This legal instrument is highly malleable and was designed to deal with the unilateral anticompetitive conduct of dominant firms. Technically, as the European Commission characterises \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 as undertakings with a large customer \/ user base, these will usually be companies in a dominant position. Therefore, if these \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 abuse their market position in an anti-competitive manner, such conduct will fall under Article 102 TFEU. For this reason, we urge the European Commission to use its discretion to actively and efficiently enforce Article 102 TFEU in such situations, to preserve and improve competition in markets. ","2173":"However, if the European Commission were to enact the NCT, we would view the European Commission efforts to limit the scope of this tool to only cover sectors which are prone to \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems as more appropriate. We base this view in the overall purpose of the NCT which, according to the European Commission, is to ensure fair and undistorted competition in the internal market. Therefore, in our view, limiting the scope of the NCT, to only cover markets \/ sectors which are characterised by \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems or have features that make the market prone to such competition problems, would be more appropriate, as this approach would be better aligned with the overall purpose of the proposed tool.","2174":"In relation to our point above, BCG would also like to make a few comments about the Online Classifieds space that BCG mainly operates in. As stated in our previous answers, our market space does not possess the features that are seen as giving rise to these perceived \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems by the European Commission, i.e. the business models in the Online Classifieds space themselves make it difficult for firms to \u2018move together\u2019, BCG has not observed any \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 in the Online Classifieds space  or other features that could give rise to anti-competitive outcomes. As we do not see any \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems (or risk thereof) in our main market space, we would like to highlight that we do not see material grounds for including the Online Classifieds space in the scope of the NCT, if it were enacted.","2175":"Article 101 TFEU is designed to address coordinated anti-competitive behaviour between undertakings, aimed at creating or strengthening a dominant market position. Thus, Article 101 TFEU can effectively address agreements, concerted practices, cartels and similar conduct. However, we believe that Article 102 TFEU, which is designed to address unilateral anti-competitive behaviour which amounts to abuse of a dominant position, is better suited to address what the European Commission classes as \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems.BCG is not aware of, and therefore, cannot point towards market situations or concerning practices which prevent, restrict or distort competition and cannot be effectively addressed by existing EU competition rules, i.e. Article 101 TFEU.BCG considers Article 102 TFEU suitable to address \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems. The way we see it, this tool is highly malleable and was designed to catch all types of anti-competitive behaviour, exerted by one or more dominant firms. Therefore, this Article catches the described \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems, when they rise to the level of severity that merits intervention into the market.","2176":"We support the use of existing competition tools due to them being effective and time-tested. Article 102 TFEU has been in operation for over 50 years, there is extensive case law and scholarly opinion explaining and analysing this legal instrument \u2013 this experience provides legal clarity and certainty for undertakings operating in the Single Market. Through this legal instrument, the European Commission has been able to intervene into markets without destroying the course of their natural development. In our view, this strikes the right balance for a healthy competition policy, which promotes economic activity, yet restricts anti-competitive behaviour. For this reason, we see Article 102 TFEU as both sufficient and effective enough to address competition issues in markets.Not applicable.First, as explained in our answers to questions No 6 and 7, many of the competition issues that the European Commission classes as \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems are either not as prevalent in markets as the European Commission assumes, or these problems do not usually rise to the extremes that call for regulatory intervention. Generally, a lot of the market features classed by the European Commission as \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems, appear to be features of natural market development cycles, especially in fast-growing markets. We take the view that, as long as undertakings are not acting anti-competitively and breaking competition rules, markets should not be intervened with. \nYet, if these issues rose to the level of severity that restricts or distorts competition in markets, we take the position that this can be resolved through existing competition tools. Whenever these \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems manifest anti-competitive effects, it will almost certainly be because one or several dominant undertakings are acting in an anti-competitive way. Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are designed to police such behaviour, whether done unilaterally or multilaterally. ","2177":"Last, we wish to highlight the risks that could come with the enaction of the NCT. We believe that ex-ante regulation in form of the NCT could pose fundamental risks to the whole digital services space in particular. The digital services space stands out to us as the most vulnerable in this regard, as it is a fast-changing and rapidly growing segment. The digital services space generally requires strong investors\u2019 support which, , generates a  continuous torrent of dynamism in the sector and, ultimately, access to innovations for consumers, which are generally geared at improving end-user experience. Undertakings in the digital services space are constantly introducing new products, services or features to improve the value they can give to their end-users, because innovations, richness of end-user experience are very important drivers of competition. ","2178":"We fear that the introduction of the NCT could disincentivise the investments in the digital services sector. In light of abovementioned considerations, this could lead to an overall reduction in innovation and consumer-welfare in the sector, which competition policy should aim to stimulate, not the opposite. Therefore, the enaction of the NCT, in our view, poses the risk that more net harm would be done on the sector development and the economy at large, rather than any benefits being produced to end customers.BCG does not support the introduction of the NCT. However, if the European Commission decides that the tool is necessary and enacts it, BCG wants to express that it does not support early intervention into markets to prevent \u2018competition problems\u2019 from arising. We support the current framework of preserving competition in markets, that is, the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, and where appropriate, the usage of interim measures to prevent harm from worsening in markets whilst investigations are ongoing.\nIn our view, early or ex-ante intervention can do more harm than good on markets. We take this view because \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems, as currently defined by the European Commission, are ambiguous. As explained in our previous answers, \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 scenarios and \u2018tipping markets\u2019 can often be confused with natural development cycles, when new markets are in the stage of rapid expansion. Most, if not all, of the discussed \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems in this questionnaire are elusive in nature, and therefore, difficult to define. Thus, allowing early intervention into such situations could result in the European Commission intervening into the natural course of the market and its natural development cycles. This is especially true taking into account the fact that there is no case law \/ precedent that maps out how to correctly approach, identify and remedy such \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems. We take the view that such interventions would undoubtedly affect efficiencies, innovation and consumer welfare in markets, artificially diverting the optimal course of the market.","2179":"Further, we take the view that early intervention is not compatible with procedural fairness and goes against the need for adequate safeguards \u2013 both important features of any legal system in democratic societies. Any intervention into markets should have a credible rationale. In our view, interventions should only be cleared after appropriate evidentiary thresholds have been met \u2013 there should be a need to clearly show that anti-competitive behaviour, that is a breach of competition rules, has taken place. Otherwise, if procedural fairness and adequate safeguards are not met, competition tools can become arbitrary policy-shaping tools. Taking all of this into account, BCG strongly supports the current competition regime and would welcome more efforts from the European Commission allocated into investigating the foreseeable impact of \u2018early intervention\u2019 on the economic and legal landscaped.BCG encourages the European Commission to use existing competition tools, and therefore, does not see a sufficient justification for or support the introduction of the NCT. In this case, we urge the European Commission to develop a more efficient case-management system and use its discretion to use Articles 101 and 102 TFEU more frequently to, where appropriate, start investigations into anti-competitive conduct. We believe this approach to solving competition issues would ensure legal clarity, the avoidance of over-regulation, necessary procedural \/ evidentiary standards and \u2018healthy\u2019 competition in markets \u2013 all of which a successful competition policy should be designed to encourage.","2180":"In case the European Commission decides that it is necessary to enact this tool, we encourage the European Commission to limit the scope of the NCT to only cover the actions of dominant companies in specific sectors. We believe the NCT should only cover abuse by dominant undertakings, as these undertakings can materially affect competition conditions in markets. Additionally, this would ensure the NCT is in line with previous case law and the general competition law framework, which only scrutinises the behaviour of dominant firms. ","2181":"Further, we advise the European Commission limits the NCT\u2019s scope to specific sectors which are characterised by these \u2018structural\u2019 competition issues for the following reasons. First, this would ensure markets are not over-regulated to the point of inefficiency. Second, this would also ensure the enacted NCT aligns with its core purpose, set out in the public consultation documentation, which is to \u2018ensure fair and undistorted competition in the internal market\u2019. Naturally, for the reasons stated above, we encourage the European Commission to exclude the Online Classifieds space from the scope of the NCT, as this market does not possess the market features which would allow \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems to form (as explained in our answers to questions in Part C of the questionnaire).","2182":"BCG does not support the introduction of the NCT for the reasons stated in this questionnaire. Yet, if the European Commission decides to enact the NCT, we believe it should be limited to sectors \/ markets where \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems are the most prevalent and \/ or most likely to arise. \nPlease also see our answers to questions No 12.2. and 42, where we have explained that the Online Classifieds space, which we operate in, does not possess market features which would allow \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems to arise.","2183":"Although we do not support the introduction of the NCT, BCG takes the view that competition issues can arise in any sectors \/ markets, not just digital sectors.\nHaving said that, we do not think that any competition issues currently existing in markets, merit the enaction of the NCT, as they can be addressed through Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. Competition law experience shows that most markets up to now, apart from natural monopolies with high barriers to entry, have functioned and developed successfully. There has never been a need for ex-ante regulation, and it is unclear to BCG why this need would have arisen now. Therefore, BCG does not see any reason why this cannot be the case moving forward and why there is this perceived need for ex ante regulation by the European Commission.\nHowever, if the European Commission were to decide to enact the NCT, BCG encourages the European Commission to ensure this tool is limited in scope to specific sectors that are characterised by competition problems, regardless of whether these markets are affected by digitisation or not. We believe this would ensure the enacted NCT aligns with its core purpose, set out in the public consultation documentation, which is to ensure fair and undistorted competition in markets.BCG is against NCT, therefore, we do not support granting the enforcement body with any of the powers listed above.Please see our answers above.","2184":"BCG does not support the introduction of the NCT. However, if the European Commission deems this tool necessary and enacts it, we believe clear and binding deadlines are crucial. Such deadlines would foster greater legal certainty for both enforcers of competition rules and undertakings operating in the Single Market.Although we are not against interim measures imposed under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, considering the already highly expansive scope of the NCT, we do not encourage the use of interim measures under the NCT.","2185":"The NCT would already give the European Commission the legal power to impose various remedies in markets, without any prior finding of wrongdoing by undertakings operating in the said markets. We take the view that allowing for the imposition or remedies and interim measures, all without a definite answer over competition rules have been infringed, would turn the NCT into an arbitrary policy-shaping tool. This would inevitably do harm on markets and disincentivise companies from basing their businesses in the Single Market.","2186":"Thus, BCG takes the view that the European Commission should not have the power to impose remedies , and certainly not interim measures, without a proper analysis of the case and a conclusion on the findings.Although BCG does not support the introduction of the NCT, if the NCT were to be adopted, we believe that voluntary commitments by companies should be accepted by the European Commission. This would ensure that appropriate solutions for competition issues in markets are found. Also, such voluntary commitments would foster a dialogue between the regulators and market participants, which could potentially help create a collaborative framework, where both regulators and undertakings aim to ensure \u2018healthy\u2019 competition in markets.Although BCG does not support the introduction of the NCT, if the NCT were to be adopted, we believe that the European Commission should aim to get comments and views from as many market participants as possible before issuing a final decision on the existence of a structural competition problem. ","2187":"In our view, this would foster a culture of collaboration \/ dialogue between all market participants and the regulator, which could have several positive effects, such as increased regulatory clarity and compliance. Most importantly, gathering different views on a singular issue would allow the European Commission to get the most possibly accurate picture of a market. Considering the expansive scope of the NCT, allowing for remedies without any finding of breach of competition rules, it is important that the European Commission\u2019s findings are highly accurate, as the finding of the existence of a structural competition problem can severely affect undertakings operating in the relevant market, which have not breached competition rules. Thus, BCG strongly encourages the European Commission to gather comments from a plethora of market players before announcing the final decision.\nAlthough BCG does not support the introduction of the NCT, if the NCT were to be adopted, we take the view that various market players should be able to comment on the appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies.","2188":"As stated above, we see the NCT\u2019s scope as unnecessarily expansive. The fact that remedies can be imposed without a finding of wrongdoing calls for strong safeguards to ensure that the remedies imposed are necessary to the point of indispensability and proportionate to the end they are aimed at. We believe that consulting other market players could ensure this.\nBCG notes that the public consultation documentation does not provide any clarity over the procedural aspects of the proposed NCT. There is no mention about what process the European Commission would follow to ensure that their findings are accurate, intervention is justified, and remedies are appropriate. We urge the European Commission to ensure that the NCT, if enacted, is subject to adequate procedural safeguards. We take the view that judicial review is indispensable to adequate procedural safeguards. ","2189":"The NCT has an unprecedentedly large scope, which would allow the European Commission to impose remedies on markets without any prior finding of wrongdoing. Therefore, BCG argues that it is imperative that the European Commission ensures adequate checks and balances which would ensure that the NCT does not become an arbitrary policy-shaping tool. These checks and balances should ensure the NCT does not become a burden for businesses operating in the European Union to the point that would deter market entry, innovation and investment. These checks and balances should include the protection of human rights, procedural fairness (due process, independence of decision-making, objectivity, transparency, access to evidence, case material, etc.) and companies\u2019 right to appeal \/ defence.","2190":"Thus, BCG strongly encourages the European Commission to set out a clear framework which explains how it will safeguard companies\u2019 rights during the enforcement of the NCT. We suggest the European Commission takes inspiration from the UK\u2019s Market Investigation regime, where the Competition Markets Authority is subject to follow a number of measures to ensure the process is fair and protective of companies\u2019 rights.\nBCG concludes that there is no need for the introduction of a new competition tool. Whether it is looked at from an economic or a legal standpoint, there is no sufficient rationale \/ justification to introduce this far-reaching tool.","2191":"In addition to not seeing developed economic or legal rationale for the introduction of the NCT, we also see significant risks for the digital services sector, if this tool were enacted. In line with our arguments in our answer to question No 24.1., we wish to highlight that ex-ante regulation in form of the NCT could pose fundamental risks to the digital services space as a whole. ","2192":"This is because the digital services space, as a dynamic and growing industry sector, heavily relies on support from investors, in order to deliver constant innovation to the markets and, thus, to end-consumers. Undertakings in the digital services space are focused on improving end-user experience, because innovation, quality and end-user experience are ultimate drivers of competition in this market space, and therefore, firms are constantly introducing new products, services or features for their customers, all of which requires financial backing.","2193":"We are afraid that the introduction of the NCT could disincentivise the investors from investments in the digital services sector. This could lead to an overall reduction in innovation and consumer-welfare in the sector, which competition policy should aim to stimulate, not the opposite. Therefore, the enaction of the NCT, in our view, poses the risk that more net harm would be done on the sector and the economy at large, and this harm would outweigh any benefits generated by NCT. ","2194":"Therefore, BCG strongly supports the usage of existing competition tools \u2013 Articles 101, 102 TFEU and Merger Control regulations \u2013 to deal with any competition problems that arise in markets. However, if, following this consultation, the European Commission decides to enact the NCT, we would encourage the European Commission to limit its scope to particular sector, as this would better align with the primary purpose of the NCT, which is to ensure fair and undistorted competition in the internal market. ","2195":"We would, therefore, also encourage the European Commission to not include the Online Classifieds space in the scope of the NCT. As explained in our answers above, this market does not possess features that allow \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems to manifest themselves in markets, meaning it would not make sense to include it in the scope of the NCT. Therefore, in our view, it would not make sense to include the Online Classifieds space in the scope of the NCT \u2013 this would simply not align with the purpose of the NCT.","2196":"Companies who have a rather large customer base often tie (by using bundling) their customers to them by offering them most of the services a customer needs (e.g. mobile, data, tv, fixed internet, smart home etc). Some of those companies tie those products to one another so a customer cannot (easily) change one of those products from the bundle.","2197":"If a company operates in several different markets it should be reviewed whether those two markets are being kept separate and no bundling takes place. If anti-competitive bundling is taking place such activities should be forbidden.Those only apply to dominant market players, but also other market players can have the same negative effect on competition.TelecommunicationsGaining access to the wholesale level fixed internet cables owned by the SMP is being made more difficult by the SMP by imposing unfair conditions or denying access based on ungrounded reasons (e.g. duct is full). A concrete example of such unfair conditions is the SMP giving access to e.g. a duct only on the condition that the operator wishing to use the duct will pay for the ducts repair costs. However as this is a rental service the SMP should offer and any repair costs should already be calculated in the rental price. Adding such conditions on access is unfair because if one operator is willing to pay the repair bill, then the other operators renting the same duct do not have to pay this extra cost. ","2198":"It creates a monopoly and it is difficult, if not even impossible, for new players to enter the market or older players to grow their market share.For any type of anti-competitive behavior, there should always be the possibility to intervene at least in some capacity in order to maintain competition.No, because this issue may also be applicable for market players who are not in a dominant position as is required by Articles 101 and 102.Cable television (i.e.e telecommunications). In estonian cable television market there are only two players whose prices are not competitive with each other. The prices are always at the same level and go up or down simultaneously, thus there is no real competition and no choice based on pricing for the consumer.The most important are the homogeneity of products which is similarly based on the stronger market player lead. The second player in the cable television market follows\/copies almost identically all the the bigger player does and this results in no real competition.","2199":"In the telecommunications sector in Estonia making cold calls to people is not allowed by an agreement by the operators. Companies are only allowed to call and offer their services to their already existing clients. This agreement however creates a situation where companies who have a bigger customers base by for example being active in more markets (e.g. also cable television where not all players in the market operate), then those companies have the legal right to call more people and capture customers from other operators. The operators who only offer the core telecommunication services (i.e. phone calls, text and data) cannot expand their customer basis for phone services as they do not have customers to call from their other service list. For companies who can call their cable TV customers who are not their phone service customers have that power and it is being heavily exploited by them.The most important is the direct network effects for Estonia as explained above under point 16.2.","2200":"It is a business strategy for many to offer a wide variety of services that can be tied together in a way for customers to take them all from one provider (often discounts are used when taking multiple services).These situations can take place in almost all markets, with no regard as to their digital nature.If customer are not free to change the service providers or it is extremely difficult to do so, then most regular customers do not want to go through the hassle and they are willing to stay with that one company even when the prices should be higher. It is therefore more difficult for competitors to win over any customers even if they offer a better price.Same answer as for question 18.8.Yes, as in markets with gatekeepers the competition is distorted and competition is not functional.No, because gatekeepers may not always be dominant market players (although they usually are). If they are not dominant players yet, then being a gatekeeper they are heading that direction of becoming a monopoly and that should already be prevented at an early stage.In some form this issues can be present in almost all markets no matter whether it is digital or not. In digital markets the structural issues are more rapid to evolve.","2201":"Not up to the full extent as article 102 only regulates dominant market players, however structural problems are also present with non-dominant market players.This situation can happen in almost all markets.Yes, in particular when dealing with non-dominant market players. The new tool should in particular focus on winner-takes-all situations and gatekeeper situations where bundling is used often and it is hard if not even impossible for customers to change just one part of the service.Yes, it should prevent winner takes all situations and tipping. It is better and more efficient to address these situation at the outset when they are about to arise and not when the problems already have occurred as often these situation create a dominant market player or in worse case even a monopoly and it is harder to recover from this situation later on for the market players who have already lost their place in the market.","2202":"The scope of the tool should not be limited to any given market as in todays' society new markets are emerging in a rapid pace and focusing the tool on only specific sectors will hinder the profitability of the tool. In addition structural competition problems can be found in many sectors\/industries, not just digital.Structural competition problems are present in other markets as well. See answer to question 28.1 above.If the actions commission can take are soft in nature, i.e. not binding, then the severity of the issue will not be taken seriously and the issues will remain. The commission should have the power to make legally binding decisions, if they feel necessary and there is a strong chance the company to whom the measure is directed at is otherwise likely not to comply with a soft recommendation. In here the commission should have the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether there is a need to take legally binding decisions or not.The more tools the commission has the more effective they can be in their work and address issues more on a case-by-case basis. As this tool should be applicable to all markets, then different markets require different approaches as well.","2203":"No, also non-structural remedies should be used and these two can be used hand-in-hand, if necessary.In order to find the correct remedies to enforce the commission need to be able to gather all the information necessary. This cannot be left up to the company\/market\/NRA in question to do as they might have less incentive to present all the relevant information.Having the power to gather information independently and directly from the relevant sources is crucial. Expert opinions familiar with the specific market dynamics will provide a valuable insight and historic perspective to put the problem into context. Expert opinion might be the most valuable power the commission can have and an independent expert can provide the sector specific insights the commission will need.Yes, as without binding deadlines the investigation will prolong for too long and thus this tool will not be effective to prevent from these competition problems from developing further.Depending on the specifics of the problem, some structural remedies (e.g. obtaining from certain behavior etc) may be necessary in order to preserve competition until the commission has finished their investigation.Yes, because in some instances the companies involved in the investigation may be in a better position to determine how to eliminate the competition problem and if the do so and are voluntarily willing to take up commitments it should be allowed as it will speed up the process and will potentially eliminate the problems quicker.Yes, other relevant market participants (not customers) should be able to voice their opinion and answer to specific questions if asked by the commission. Other players have usually rather good knowledge of the market dynamics and thus can assist the commission in their proceedings.Suggestions by other market players should be made already during the commenting stage (questions 37) as not to delay the proceedings even more.Yes, if the commission has power to make binding decisions. If their power is only to make suggestions, then no judicial review is necessary.Tailored remedies depending on the situation and market specific characteristics.","2204":"These responses are based on a review of published reports, studies and articles, including the EC's New Competition Tool Inception Impact Assessment.

The other two features listed above in question 18.7 indicate that a company can exercise an increased control of their respective online whole platform eco-systems to the extent that structural risks for competition may arise.Not applicable.Yes there is a need for the Commission to be able to intervene in gatekeeper scenarios at an early stage to prevent\/address structural risks for competition in order to minimize such risks and help ensure competition, fairness, innovation that benefits consumers and business users, and an open market for new entry companies.Although we consider that Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are suitable and sufficiently effective instruments to intervene in markets characterized by 'gatekeeper platforms,' the effectiveness of Articles 101 and 102 would be further bolstered by the adoption and implementation of the proposed new ex ante regulatory instrument for large online platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers in the European Union\u2019s internal market, which would provide a tool for early intervention to minimize the structural risks for competition that could arise from large online platforms acting as gatekeepers.This response is based on a review of published reports, studies and articles - including the EC's Inception Impact Assessments for a \"New Competition Tool,\" and the \"Ex ante regulatory instrument for large online platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers in the European Union\u2019s internal market.\"  This review indicated that structural competition problems are very common in digital sectors\/markets, including, gatekeeper scenarios that give rise to possible structural risks for competition in digital sectors\/markets.  Relevant sectors include online retailers, marketplace operators, app store operators, social media platforms and search engine platforms.","2207":"Article 101 of the EU Treaty is suitable and sufficiently effective to address structural competition problems.  However, in our view, it would be more effective as an instrument to intervene in digital markets characterized by online platform companies acting as gatekeepers if bolstered by the proposed new ex ante regulatory instrument for large online platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers in the European Union\u2019s internal market, which would provide a tool for early intervention to minimize the structural risks for competition that could arise from large online platforms acting as gatekeepers.

We do believe that Articles 101 and 102 can be made more effective in minimizing the structural risks for competition in digital markets that could arise from online platform companies acting as gatekeepers with the adoption and implementation of the proposed new ex ante regulatory instrument for large online platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers in the European Union\u2019s internal market, which would provide a mechanism for early intervention to minimize such structural risks for competition arising from online platforms acting as gatekeepers.   ","2209":"With regard to the new competition tool as proposed in the four options presented in the Inception Impact Assessment, we believe this tool is not necessary, justified or appropriate. In our view, Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are sufficiently effective to address structural competition problems and therefore, a new competition tool is not necessary or justified, and if implemented, would impose another regulatory layer leading to over-regulation that would stifle innovation that in turn, would harm consumer welfare.  More importantly, the new competition tool as proposed would provide the EC excessive power and overly-broad discretion that would basically empower the EC to order a restructuring of a company's business and\/or modify a company's behavior and business model without a finding of a violation of Articles 101 or 102 of the EU Treaty.  The overreaching discretion and power provided by the proposed new competition tool would also lead to legal uncertainty, further hampering businesses' willingness to innovate and strengthen competition with new business models which in turn, would hurt consumer welfare.","2210":"We strongly believe that current competition rules are sufficiently effective in addressing structural competition problems  and issues in digital markets.  That being said, we also believe that the current competition rules can be made more effective in minimizing the structural risks for competition and more sufficient to address the contestability issues that could arise from online platforms acting as gatekeepers with the adoption and implementation of the proposed new ex ante regulatory instrument for large online platforms with significant network effects acting as gate-keepers in the European Union\u2019s internal market - which is reflected by the combination of the above options 2 and 3 in Question 40.  Combining options 2 and 3 would provide a mechanism for early intervention to minimize such structural risks for competition in digital markets arising from online platform companies acting as gatekeepers.  (Please refer to our submission of responses to the questionnaire on the ex ante regulatory instrument for more detailed comments on this initiative).","2211":"The features we have highlighted are the ones that create the strongest in-market potential for weakened competition in theory, especially when several are present at the same time. However, even in theory, all of these create incentives by rival firms to solve them \u2013 for example, information asymmetries should create incentives for rivals to inform customers to win them over \u2013 or create greater incentives for rivals to give users a better offering in the expectation of having a long and valuable relationship with customers after capturing them. High switching costs, for example, give assurance to a provider that they can invest in attractive up-front offers to customers to win their business; similarly single-homing means that, although customers will be stickier, there is a strong incentive to invest in acquiring those customers. In practice, these factors are rarely a barrier to competition, and often are not present in the same circumstance. Direct network effects are much less important in situations where users multi-home, which is the case for almost all users of social networks.","2212":"The scenarios described above generalise far too much to be useful in the practical application of a competition tool, both by ignoring the potential benefits of some of the scenarios described to consumers and by ignoring the incentives that many scenarios create for further innovation by rivals to compete with incumbents. Unless markets are implicitly seen as static, without the potential for technological or business model innovation, the above scenarios are unlikely to be anticompetitive per se.","2213":"Vertical integration of the kind described is likely to be pro-competitive and good for consumers, because it allows companies to lower costs and potentially offer better product offerings that are well-integrated into other products. When platforms offer products in adjacent markets they frequently do so to compete with well-established incumbents in those markets, increasing competition. As one 2008 empirical study concludes, \u201cthe empirical literature over the last 25 years largely supports\u201d the proposition that \u201ccombining substitutes is bad and combining complements is good, unless demonstrated otherwise.\u201d (https:\/\/sls.gmu.edu\/gai\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/27\/2017\/04\/The-Antitrust-Treatment-of-Vertical-Restraints-Beyond-the-Possibility-Theorems.pdf) Empirical evidence amassed since 2008 continues to support these conclusions (https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3245940).See above. Given the presumptive benefits of vertical integration, and the use of Articles 101 and 102 to successfully challenge vertical restraints in recent years, there is no reason to believe that the problem is a lack of enforcement in this area.","2214":"As outlined in another submission, \"The focus on \u201cunfair\u201d practices is misguided from a regulatory point of view. Every single decision adopted by a large online platform is, in some sense, unfair. That is, all platform design choices create both winners and losers. And losing firms will very often believe that these decisions ignore some important virtue of their products. For instance, an online retail platform might believe that certain types of goods are more interesting for consumers and thus place them more prominently on the platform. This type of favoring - though it may be perceived as \u201cunfair\u201d by sellers that have been demoted - is eminently desirable. It is precisely this sort of unfairness that ensures consumers get the best deal. The upshot is that it is irrelevant whether a practice is \u201cunfair\u201d, so long as it maximizes social welfare.\"See above.","2215":"Algorithmic pricing is likely to be pro-competitive by allowing more effective price discrimination by firms and more rapid price changes to align supply with demand in real time. Algorithmic price collusion has not been shown to be a serious problem in markets, and is unlikely to become one since firms can easily defect by privately offering prices that undercut the collusive price, making any collusive arrangement unstable.See above. There are no cases where additional powers have been shown to be needed.","2216":"First, the activities of online platforms can be subjected to European competition law enforcement (which is not to say that they generally should be so subjected). The competition rules give authorities sufficient leeway to prosecute a platform\u2019s behavior, so long as it is ultimately detrimental to social welfare and competition. In that respect, one important advantage of competition enforcement is that the system has benefited from decades of enforcement. This has enabled authorities and courts to achieve a balance between false positives and false negatives. This balance may not be perfect - in Europe, the pendulum might have swung too far towards the enforcement side of the spectrum - but it is vastly superior to that which could realistically be achieved through ad hoc regulation, which has strong political incentives to overregulate, can be captured by politically influential groups, and often ignores the costs of its regulation.","2217":"Second, regulation would likely entail unintended consequences. Chief among these is the possibility that new regulations would act as a barrier to entry. In other words, regulation destined to spur entry in certain segments of the platform industry (by imposing obligations upon \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platforms) might, paradoxically, make it more costly for rivals to grow into \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platforms themselves. Indeed, the proposed regulations would necessarily entail significant compliance costs that might prove harder to recoup for smaller firms as well as firms that are less experienced with the workings of the regulatory regime.See above.Structural competition problems are most likely to be found in highly regulated markets.The Commission could play a useful role in identifying regulatory barriers to competition and advising members states in how to address these barriers.","2218":"The need for such a tool has not been established. In most cases, the circumstances in which the Commission appears to believe such a tool would be beneficial are areas where the market is working well for consumers (eg, in the case of vertical integration by platforms) and it seems likely that the Commission would misuse additional powers to inadvertently prevent pro-competitive behaviour.As argued above, the Commission is not omniscient and an error-cost framework that considers the costs of mistaken over-intervention and under-intervention should lead it to a more humble stance that adopts a \"wait and see\" stance with regard to the behaviour of businesses in complex, unpredictable markets. If the Commission intervenes pre-emptively in markets and does so mistakenly, beneficial business behaviour will be prohibited with no mechanism for learning (since the business behaviour will never be observed), and hence no correction mechanism. On the other hand, the Commission can intervene later on after clear harms have been established in a non-pre-emptive regime. This kind of error-cost analysis should lead the Commission to being extremely cautious about pre-emptive intervention and to stick to interventions after the fact when clear harm to consumer welfare can be demonstrated.","2219":"There is no market is not \"affected by digitisation\".As outlined above, there is not a strong rationale for introducing additional competition powers for the Commission above its existing powers, which are extensive. If it is given new powers, they should focus on complementing its existing powers by identifying regulatory barriers to competition, whether they come from sector regulation or legislation.As  outlined above, there is not a strong rationale for introducing additional competition powers for the Commission above its existing powers for companies.","2220":"Bitkom represents more than 2,700 companies of the digital economy, including 2,000 direct members.

In general, we are convinced that none of the above mentioned factors alone automatically lead to competition issues.\nIn our view, access to data can be a competitive advantage, especially if the dependency on data for business models has an effect on competitors, but it does not automatically lead to market failure and competition problems (Row Q). The same is true for the use of pricing algorithms (Row R), which can also be a procompetitive factor. With regard to Row M we think it is necessary to define platforms more clearly to define which markets are encompassed by the question and the relevant factors for fair competition, f.i. whether multihoming is possible. Row G seems to address factors that are partly already addressed by the P2B regulation and the data protection framework. Row K addresses direct network effects and makes a reference to phone networks. However, the described network effect does not manifest in phone networks anymore nowadays. The zero-pricing markets addressed in Row P are in our view not a competition factor per se.We would like to stres that in our view the factors mentioned above cannot in themselves or on their own create structural competition problems. Only under specific circumstances and with an interplay of several factors competition problems could arise. This assessment should be evidence based and detailed.","2222":"We would need more in depth analyses to answer that question.Please see the Bitkom Position on the Gatekeeper Rules in the DSA ConsultationWe would need more in depth analyses to answer that question.While some of the features may be important for the determination, the abovementioned features cannot determine a substantial\/high risk on their own.

With regard to single-homing we would like to point out the importance of it being more nuanced. The threat of switching of even of a smaller section of customers, and the fact that other sets of users of the platform can multi-home, leads to sufficient competitive pressures.

Delivery is carried out either \nthrough the \u201cmarketplace\u201d model, where vendors carry out the delivery, or the \u201cown delivery\u201d model, \nwhere the Delivery Hero platform carries out the delivery.  ","2228":"The food delivery sector is highly competitive and dynamic, for a number of reasons. Delivery Hero \ncompetes not only with other food delivery platforms, but also with restaurants themselves that offer \ndirect ordering on the phone, online, or in person. The barriers to entry and expansion are low; there is \nno one prescribed route to entry or growth, and there are numerous business propositions that \ncompanies can adopt in order to penetrate, including expanding an existing tech or e-commerce business \nor restaurants developing their own website or app. Furthermore, the amount of initial capital required is \nlow, in part due to the fact that new entrants can start at a local level (e.g. one city, or certain areas \nwithin a city) and expand.  ","2229":"As regards in particular the need to adopt the NCT, Delivery Hero believes that there is no \u201cenforcement \ngap\u201d in the current EU competition regime. The NCT identifies two types of \u201cstructural\u201d competition \nproblems that the existing enforcement toolkit cannot supposedly not address: (i) \u201cStructural risks for \ncompetition\u201d where certain market characteristics and the conduct of the companies operating in the \nmarkets create a threat for competition and (ii) \u201cStructural market failure\u201d, where a market is displaying \nsystemic failures going beyond the conduct of a particular company with market power  and oligopolistic \nmarket structures with an increased risk for tacit collusion. To the contrary, we believe that Article 101 \nTFEU and Article 102 TFEU are both flexible enough to allow the European Commission to address these ","2230":"Delivery Hero is particularly concerned about the level of regulatory burden and legal uncertainty that the \nNCT would create, as it will ultimately put brakes on innovation and competition. Setting restrictions or \nimposing commitments absent proven harm will not re-enforce competition but rather dampen it, and \nultimately harm consumers. Any tool granting the European Commission such discretionary powers to set \nrestrictions where there is no proven harm must in any event be counterbalanced by robust safeguards \nsuch that rights of defence and principles of checks and balances are maintained.  ","2231":"In addition, based on the current proposals the NCT appears to be substantially similar to the  platform-\nspecific ex ante regulation included in the Digital Services Act, since both appear at least partially to target \ncompanies \u201cacting as gatekeepers\u201d. In addition, we understand that the enforcement of both tools will be \nled by two different Directorates-General (CNECT and COMP, respectively). We believe that these \noverlapping initiatives present the risk of a lack of clarity regarding the competences between the \nDirectorates-General and subsequently of the consistency of enforcement. Further, such overlapping \ninitiatives increase the burden for the companies to identify the relevant scope of application and may \nthus ultimately create legal uncertainty for them.  ","2232":"Finally, we note that the proposal for the NCT also overlaps with legislative initiatives in certain Member \nStates, and it is unclear from the current proposal how the competencies between the European \nCommission and the Member States will operate in relation to these. In order to avoid enforcement \ninconsistencies between the Member States and the European Commission as well as the ultimate \nregulatory burden and subsequent risk of legal uncertainty for companies active in various Member \nStates, this must be adequately addressed.  ","2233":"ARD is one of the two public service broadcasters in Germany and provides TV, Radio and Online Services.ARD provides online service MediathekenARD is one of the two German public service broadcasters providing radio, television as well as online service Mediatheken. As well as its own online-distribution channels, ARD is dependent upon a number of third-party audio and video platforms, social media and app stores to universally reach the public. ARD has the legal public service remit to use third party platforms especially in order to reach young audiences, as young citizens access predominantly audio and audio-visual content via different online platforms. Furthermore, funk, the online content network of ARD and ZDF was especially created to be present on third party platforms next to its own website and app.ARD is dependent upon a number of third-party audio and video platforms, social media and app stores to universally reach the public. ARD has the legal public service remit to use third party platforms especially in order to reach young audiences, as young citizens access predominantly audio and audio-visual content via different online platforms.First of all, it is important to note that in addition to their stand-alone relevance, most of the features\/elements are interdependent and develop their effects especially when combined. For example, the stronger the vertical integration (B), the greater the potential for strong indirect network effects (L) and the incentive for customers to only use one platform (M).","2234":"\u2022\tInformation asymmetry on the customer side (G) is of special concern in markets and business models that are dominated by the use of algorithms. They are considered as trade secrets, making it practicably impossible for the customers to determine the functioning of a service that they are regularly dependent on. ","2235":"\u2022\tLack of access to a given input\/asset which is necessary to compete on the market (e.g. access to data) (I), especially in connection with data dependency (Q), is especially worrying in constellations of vertical integrations as well as so called \u201cgatekeeper scenarios\u201d (please refer to our responses to the respective questions below). In this regard, constellations of platform owners competing with the business users on the platform (so-called dual role situations) (N) are especially problematic, because they further reduce the incentive to share data.","2236":"\u2022\tIt is not regulatory barriers (E), but regulatory asymmetries that may lead to structural competition problems. For example, compared to traditional media organizations, which have been subject to structural, content and liability rules, platforms have only been subject to rather light regulation, e.g. under the eCommerce-Directive. This has undoubtedly allowed platforms to expand into a number of markets with very limited regulatory scrutiny.","2237":"\u2022\tCustomers typically using one platform (i.e. they predominantly single-home) (M) may be due to the fact that they cannot easily switch. However, there is also need for analysing user behaviour with regards to their actual willingness to make use of substitutable services. An additional focus on features specific to user behavior that could contribute to the creation of structural competition problems is very important.","2238":"Finally, though not in the list of the features the Commission identifies, a parameter that has arguably exacerbated structural competition problems is merger control. As the Furman report notes \u201cover the last ten years the five largest firms have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None has been blocked and very few have had conditions attached to approval [\u2026] or even been scrutinized by competition authorities\u201d. We find that merger control should be exercised in a way that takes into account the \u201cportfolio effects\u201d of the merger, including access to vast amounts of data, with a view to addressing certain issues (e.g. high degree of vertical integration) giving rise to structural competition problems.Please also refer to our responses to the questions regarding the different aforementioned market scenarios below in this section C.Strategies to extend market power to related markets are very common in the digital sectors\/markets. Taking into consideration the definition of such markets at the beginning of this questionnaire, describing \u201cdigital markets\u201d as markets \u201clargely relying on digital technologies with certain specific characteristics, such as extreme economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, zero pricing and data dependency\u201d, it is precisely digital technologies that enable companies to build their market strategies on large amounts of collected data and to easily connect their online services based on a single infrastructure. ","2239":"However, there still is a need for a clearer definition of \u201cdigital markets\u201d, especially if a new competition tool will have a primary focus on such markets (please also refer to our response to question no. 20.1.).At the outset, companies\u2018 possibility to rely on large amounts of data already collected in their core market(s) significantly lowers their entrepreneurial risk to expand into adjacent\/neighbouring or related markets in the first place. Depending on the type(s) of service(s) offered in the core market(s), the collected data might even be so focused that it will provide them with an unfair advantage over their competitors (e.g. in cases of intermediation service providers extending into the markets of the intermediated products, please also refer to our response to question no. 9.3.).","2240":"Subsequently, any market expansion will enable a company in digital sectors\/markets to then rely on the interconnectedness of their different online services and to collect even larger and more specified amounts of data in connection therewith, thereby further fostering vertical integration and creating a reciprocal effect between market activities. Ultimately, especially providers of online platforms with multi-market orientation will be able to solidify their power across all markets. The problems only intensify when they additionally expand into the value chain. In the end, this will favour other structural competition problems addressed in this questionnaire, especially gatekeeper scenarios. ","2241":"Moreover, especially in cases of vertical integration of platforms their providers have considerable incentive to grant preferential treatment to their own services (self-preferencing) in various forms (e.g. prominent display, demotion of competing content, interfering with providers\u2019 brand attribution, differentiation as regards access to data), refuse to share information about how they work in practice, especially regarding their use of algorithms or voice assistants, and\/or refuse to share relevant data with competing business users in downstream markets (insofar, please also refer to our responses to the questions on \u201cgatekeeper scenarios\u201d below).In cases of structural competition problems due to repeated strategies by companies with market power to extend their market position into related markets, ARD believes that the Commission should be able to intervene. In order to fulfil its public service remit, ARD also needs to reach the citizens and especially the younger audience online and on third-party platforms. This can become problematic in cases where a company due to its market power extends their market position into related markets and can rely e.g. on large amounts on data, thereby acting as a gatekeeper or creating a competitive disadvantage for business users like ARD in serving the audience. In these cases, there may be a need for behavioural or even structural remedies, e.g. granting of access to key inputs like the collected data, to ensure a level playing field.On the one hand, Article 101 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument to address the abovementioned market situations, since it only applies to agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices and insofar requires the interaction of at least two entities. However, repeated strategies of a single company with market power in a core market to extend its market position to related markets usually do not involve a necessary second undertaking. ","2242":"On the other hand, Article 102 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument, since it only applies to constellations of abuse of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it. Apart from the fact, that the abovementioned scenarios may arise even where companies have not yet acquired a dominant market position \u2013 in addition to the fact that the \u201cdominance\u201d threshold is very high \u2013, there is yet considerable uncertainty as to whether the aforementioned problems qualify as constellations of abuse of such a position. ","2243":"It remains to be seen whether the European Commission\u2019s current antitrust investigation against Amazon to assess whether its use of sensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace is in breach of EU competition rules will shed some light on the question, whether and to what extent the current rules are flexible enough to tackle the relevant und comparable problems.Please refer to our responses to questions no. 6 and 8.2. above.The main source of the issues we have encountered in dealing with platforms is lack of bargaining power. Combined with the large user base platforms control and to which we need access, lack of bargaining power translates into a need to accepting unfair contractual terms (on a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 basis) and being subject to unfair practices. \nFor example, in many cases, in order to be present on certain platforms, many PSM organizations are forced to grant a non-exclusive, sublicensable and royalty-free worldwide licence of their content. ","2244":"Another example concerns retaliatory and bundling practices. For example, certain platforms bundle paid\/subscription-based and free services. If PSM do not agree to the distribution of their content through the subscription-based channel, they are not allowed to distribute their content for free. This is a \u2018take-it-or-leave-it offer\u2019, which requires PSM to either refrain from reaching the young audiences that such platforms control or acquire the relevant rights in order to be able to distribute their content through the subscription-based channel. Acquisition of such rights is not the preferred option for PSM. \nYet another issue we have encountered concerns unilateral (and often unannounced) modifications to the Terms and Conditions imposed by platforms (NB: Platforms\u2019 Terms and Conditions are often drafted in a vague and unintelligible manner). Such modifications concern a range of issues, including the prices that platforms charge for their services and de-referencing of PSM sub-domains that led to a significant decline in audiences.","2245":"Other practices which we have experienced and consider unfair include: \n\u2022\tPlatforms\u2019 interpretation of the GDPR (e.g. a platform\u2019s insistence that it qualifies as a \u2018data controller\u2019 whereas it could be regarded as \u2018data processor\u2019 for the purposes of the GDPR); \n\u2022\tPlatforms\u2019 refusal to grant access to data; \n\u2022\tPlatforms\u2019 preferential treatment of own services or services offered by business users that pay for such preferential treatment; \n\u2022\tLack of transparency regarding ranking (and, more broadly, recommendation mechanisms) and, in the case of voice assistants, lack of transparency regarding the parameters that determine the outcome of the user\u2019s query. \n\u2022\tLack of brand attribution: Platforms may remove logos and\/or other distinctive features of their business users, including content providers. As a result, the online user is not in the position to assess who offers the content she consumes and the content provider cannot establish a relationship with its audiences.\nPlease refer to our response to question no. 10.3. above.ARD identifies special concerns regarding the consequences of successful anti-competitive monopolisation strategies. Market monopolisation, especially in the media sector, intensifies all problems already related to \u201cgatekeeper scenarios\u201d (please refer to our responses to the relevant questions below). ","2246":"A more recent example ARD has encountered concerned funk, the online content network of ARD and ZDF specifically catering to younger audiences. As of recently, funk made use of WhatsApp to inform users about new content via newsletters. But after Facebook made changes to the terms and conditions, limiting access to WhatsApp and WhatsApp for Business to \u201cnews providers\u201d, funk was excluded from the services due to its multi-facetted content approach (including also entertainment). This examples illustrates the market power that monopolists like WhatsApp in the sector of communication apps (with market shares of above 90%, especially among younger target groups). Such unilateral modifications to the terms and conditions imposed by monopolists may have significant consequences for the business users of their services.In cases of structural competition problems due to anti-competitive monopolisation, ARD believes that the Commission should be able to intervene. In order to fulfil its public service remit, ARD also needs to reach the citizens and especially the younger audience online and on third-party platforms. This can become problematic in cases where a company occupies a monopoly position in a relevant market. In these cases, there may be a need for behavioural or even structural remedies, e.g. the imposition of obligations to modify the terms and conditions concerned.On the one hand, Article 101 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument to address the abovementioned market situations, since it only applies to agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices and insofar requires the interaction of at least two entities. However, anti-competitive monopolisation does not involve a necessary second undertaking. ","2247":"On the other hand, Article 102 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument, since it only applies to constellations of abuse of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it. However, not every conduct in pursuing monopolisation may amount to exploitative abuse under Article 102 TFEU. ","2248":"Product markets that can be described as economies of scale and \/ or scope have the strong tendency to turn into tipping markets. High entry and low operating costs disincentivise potential competitors to enter or expand into these markets after they have tipped, while incentivising the \u201cwinning\u201d market player to further expand into other sectors that can easily be engaged in through already established operating infrastructure. This may even lead to very few companies controlling the entire value chain and \/ or digital ecosystems. These traits explain the high degree of concentration especially in digital markets where the conditions of competition are currently dictated by a handful of providers. ","2249":"Another parameter that leads to concentration is the two- (or multi-) sided character of these digital markets; the direct and indirect network effects that are created as a result of this characteristic (e.g. the larger the user base of a search engine, the more efficient it may function, the more new users and advertisers it attracts) usually leads to the market \u201ctipping\u201c towards one or very few providers. ","2250":"These direct or indirect network effects are caused by as well as further contribute to users tending to predominantly single-home. \nEspecially in content distribution and related markets, the use of digital technologies and the digital infrastructure makes way for economies of scale and \/ or scope as well as strong direct and indirect network effects. The interplay with and the interconnectedness of users enables market players to gather large amounts of diverse data, that would not be available otherwise.","2251":"In this sense, classic examples are, among others, online search engines and social networks which e.g. heavily rely on (large amounts of) user data.\nJust like with successful anti-competitive monopolisation strategies, ARD identifies special concerns regarding the consequences of \u201ctipping markets\u201d. They may, especially in the media sector, intensify all problems already related to \u201cgatekeeper scenarios\u201d (please refer to our responses to the relevant questions below). ","2252":"As regards public service broadcasters like ARD, attracting a large user base to their content is the core of the public service mission. We are bound by \u201cuniversality\u201c obligations, being required to reach a high proportion of the population with high quality \/ public value content. This will always be significantly harder in \u201ctipped\u201d markets or will eventually lead to dependence and subsequently to \u201cgatekeeper scenarios\u201d. Ultimately, it will enable the \u201cwinning\u201d company to pursue strategies to extend its market position to related markets much more easily.\nIn cases of \u201ctipping markets\u201d, ARD believes that the Commission should be able to intervene early in order to preserve \/ improve competition and to avoid monopolisation and \u201cgatekeeper scenarios\u201d as potentially irreversible effects on competition. In these cases, there may be a need for early behavioural or even structural remedies, e.g. the granting of access to key inputs like collected data to ensure a level playing field.On the one hand, Article 101 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument to address the abovementioned market situations, since it only applies to agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices and insofar requires the interaction of at least two entities. However, \u201ctipping markets\u201d do not involve a necessary second undertaking. ","2253":"On the other hand, Article 102 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument, since it only applies to constellations of abuse of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it. However, the capturing of users may for itself hardly ever amount to exploitative abuse under Article 102 TFEU. ","2254":"Lastly, if a decision finding an infringement of the competition rules is adopted, it is binding only on the companies under investigation and it will only allow for ex post-intervention, which may not manage to restore the competitive process in highly dynamic digital markets.Gatekeeper scenarios are very common in the digital sectors \/ markets. Taking into consideration the definition of such markets at the beginning of this questionnaire, describing \u201cdigital markets\u201d as markets \u201clargely relying on digital technologies with certain specific characteristics, such as extreme economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, zero pricing and data dependency\u201d, it is precisely digital technologies that enable companies to build their market strategies on large amounts of collected data and to easily connect their online services based on a single infrastructure.","2255":"However, we think that the qualifying criteria for determining \u201cgatekeepers\u201d in a new competition tool would need to be reconciled with the criteria for determining \u201cthe gatekeeper role of large online platform companies\u201d in a new \u201cex ante regulatory instrument\u201d in order to ensure a consistent regulatory approach. Insofar, we would like to additionally refer you to our responses to questions no. 1 to 5 in section III. of the \u201cDigital Services Act package: open public consultation\u201d.","2256":"A \u201chigh number of customers\/users\u201d (1.) is the main starting point for determining a company\u2018s status as a gatekeeper. At first glance, the criterion of \u201ccustomer\/user numbers\u201d seems to be rather conventional. However, especially in online content distribution markets the success of most companies depends on the continuous optimization and improvement of their algorithm-based and data-dependent business models as well as as to some extent on network effects. Therefore, the number of users of a platform has been given a new significance. ","2257":"However, it is not only the absolute number, but the quantity of users relative to the target group of a service. In fact, special interest platforms with a small target audience may acquire a gatekeeper status much quicker and defend it much more efficiently. Target groups are not necessarily only on \u201clarge platforms\u201d, such as Facebook and YouTube, but on smaller ones, where it is equally important to have access to data. Furthermore, ARD offers also content, which is not mass attractive and would have problems of re-finance on the free market. Hence, those content is not necessarily on big commercial platforms. For example, in the field of online radio and podcast, most platforms would not be considered as \u201clarge\u201d. Therefore, new regulation should be applicable to all platforms that have a significant use in the respective target group and are therefore necessary for playing out the content to fulfil the public service remit. ","2258":"All the same, the size of a user base \u2013 even regarding a limited target audience \u2013 does not automatically solidify the gatekeeper status of a company. Each company may choose an \u201copen system\u201d allowing users to easily port their data or switch between services. Especially when a proprietary system is cemented and a lock-in scenario arises, does this result in a bottleneck (2.).","2259":"In the end, this will regularly lead to situations where business operators need to accept the conditions of competition of the platform \u2013 including its business environment \u2013 to reach the customers that use the specific platform (3.).ARD thinks that it is of greatest concern that gatekeepers determine the dynamics of competition on the aftermarket \/ platform and that business operators can only reach their customers by adapting their business model and accepting their terms and conditions. \nGatekeeper companies are structuring the platform environment according to their business models, thereby potentially setting distribution standards for an entire industry and ocassionally clashing with European and national law standards. This is especially relevant for public service broadcasters such as ARD which are legally obliged to fulfil their remit in accordance with certain legal requirements, while otherwise being granted editorial freedom. In a similar vein, their terms and conditions may require business users to grant a non-exclusive, sublicensable and royalty-free worldwide licence of their content or to agree to retaliatory and bundling practices. In the end, the application of unilateral global community standards and terms and conditions can have major consequences for freedom of expression, information and the media as well as media pluralism and cultural diversity.\nSimilar concerns arise regarding platforms\u2019 use of algorithms which are neither transparent, nor comprehensible. Ultimately, they decide which content and news reaches their users. This has to be seen as well in the context of the discussion around disinformation and filter bubbles. For ARD and public service broadcasters in general, it is paramount to stay relevant, easily accessible and findable in order to fulfill the public service remit for the benefit of citizens and societies. Although the protection of other, especially societal goals, will in the end merely be a reflex of competition regulation, these objectives should at least be considered when analysing the structural competition problems.\nAdditionally, ARD encounters problems with gatekeepers\u2019 practices of self-preferencing of their own or their commercial partners\u2019 content and services over third-party offers disproportionately. They pick and choose the content and features of public service broadcasters which best support their commercial goals. This reduces the degree to which we can deliver our public service objectives on these platforms. \nLastly, gatekeeper companies regularly have absolute sovereignity when it comes to their users\u2018 data, especially data being collected in connection with the provision of third party content, but do not provide necessary data sufficiently, let alone in a standardised format, to their business users. Platform providers are thereby able to monitor how public service and commercial content is consumed together with their own competing services on the platform. Hence, they can adapt their services accordingly, leading to a competitive advantage.\nBoth problems are even more worrying in the abovementioned \u201cdual role situations\u201d, when a platform owner is competing with the business users on the platform.\nIn ARD\u2019s view, there is a need for the competent authority to be able to intervene in gatekeeper scenarios to address structural competition problems. ","2260":"Secondly, there is a need for an additional ex ante-regulatory framework imposing obligations and prohibitions that are generally applicable to all \u2013 not only \u201clarge\u201d \u2013 online platforms with gatekeeper power, that simultaneously allows for the possibility to impose on top tailored remedies on these platforms on a case-by-case basis (please refer to our responses to section III. of the \u201cDigital Services Act package: open public consultation\u201d). ","2261":"Additionally, a new competition tool allowing to address structural risks and lack of competition in (digital) markets on a case-by-case basis would be helpful, but could only complement the aforementioned additional ex ante-regulatory framework. Since such tool would merely address \u201estructural competition problems\u201c, it could not sufficiently be applied to tackle unfair practices at the expense of individual business users like public service broadcasters.On the one hand, Article 101 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument to intervene in markets characterised by \u2018gatekeeper platforms\u2019 in order to preserve\/improve competition, since it only applies to agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices and insofar requires the interaction of at least two entities. However, \u201egatekeeper platforms\u201c gain and make use of their status independently. ","2262":"On the other hand, Article 102 TFEU is no suitable and sufficiently effective instrument, since it only applies to constellations of abuse of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it. Apart from the fact, that gatekeeper scenarios arise even where companies have not yet acquired a dominant market position, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether the aforementioned problems qualify as constellations of abuse of such a position. ","2263":"In view of the above, we first and foremost find that there is a need for an additional ex ante-regulatory framework imposing obligations and prohibitions that are generally applicable to all \u2013 not only \u201clarge\u201d \u2013 online platforms with gatekeeper power, that simultaneously allows for the possibility to impose tailored remedies on these platforms on a case-by-case basis.

Since such tool would merely address \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d, it could not sufficiently be applied to tackle unfair practices at the expense of individual business users like public service broadcasters.","2265":"The regulatory toolbox of such ex ante-regulatory framework should, among others, feature an \u201cumbrella provision\u201d prohibiting the abuse of economic dependence in gatekeeper scenarios, which could be further substantiated through a non-exhaustive list of typical abusive practices. Given the fast-moving and dynamic character of platform markets, such approach would enable regulatory authorities to find flexible responses to new challenges (for more details please refer to our responses in section III. of the \u201cDigital Services Act package\u201d consultation).ARD is of the opinion that structural competition problems mainly occur in digital sectors\/markets. This includes, among others, markets for online content distribution (especially over-the-top and through voice assistants), social networks, communication apps, online search, operating systems for smartphones and app stores.","2266":"Ultimately, a potentially strong focus of a new competition tool on such \u201edigital sectors\/markets\u201c must be based on a clear understanding of what exactly qualifies a sector\/market to be \u201edigital\u201c. According to the definition at the beginning of this questionnaire, \u201edigital markets\u201c refer to \u201emarkets largely relying on digital technologies with certain specific characteristics, such as extreme economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, zero pricing and data dependency\u201c. For the time being, this allows for a first common understanding of such markets. As of today, an identifiable share of markets is clearly relying on digital technologies. Yet, there is need for further clarification of the concept of reliance on digital technologies in order to ensure legal certainty. ","2267":"The challenge of taking into consideration \u201edigital\u201c features in identifying and defining products markets are equally being revealed as regards the Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market for the purposes of Community competition law. We want to stress that a coordinated and comprehensive approach is necessary to create a homogenous legal framework for \u201edigital sectors\/markets\u201c.","2268":"Finally, we find that structural competition problems may also arise in other specific sectors \/ markets, like the telecommunications \/ media sectors (especially in the case of vertically integrated telecommunications network providers). Also, we cannot exclude that structural competition problems may arise in other sectors \/ markets, including especially sectors \/ markets that may have a natural tendency to concentration.","2269":"\nPlease refer to our responses to questions no. 9.3., 11.3., 17.3. and 19.3.Please refer to tour responsens to questions no. 6 and 8.2 above.Please refer to our responses to questions no. 9.3., 11.3., 17.3. and 19.3.Please refer to tour responsens to questions no. 6 and 8.2 above.In principle, ARD supports the introduction of a new competition tool, since there is indeed a need to tackle certain structural competition problems that may not be adressed adequately through existing enforcement mechanisms based on Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. ","2270":"Additionally, the interrelation between any new regulation and the existing rules in and based on Articles 101 and 102 TFEU needs to be thouroughly evaluated.In ARD\u2019s view, the new competition tool should also be able to prevent structural competition problems from arising and thus allow for early intervention in the markets concerned. Especially in highly dynamic digital markets belated intervention may not manage to restore the competitive process. This is especially true for constellations of anti-competitive monopolisation, \u201ctipping markets\u201d and \u201cgatekeeper scenarios\u201d.","2271":"However, some restraint is called for when it comes to allowing for such early intervention in the markets concerned. First of all, depending on the threshold criteria for initiating market investigations and subsequently for applying measures to prevent structural competition problems from arising, the entrusted authority may gain the capacity to (re-)organise entire markets even before market mechanisms would have been able to lead to sufficient counteraction or self-correction, thereby fundamentally changing the way in which competition law works. Secondly, apart from the general challenge to adequately identify and define \u201cstructural competition problems\" across diverse markets, it seems next to impossible to determine a definite threshold and, accordingly, a clear point in time at which a risk analysis would require the entrusted authority to take action while respecting the principle of proportionality. Any concrete measure allowing for early intervention in the markets in response to \u201cstructural risks for competition\u201d needs to be carefully drafted and balanced to avoid \u201cover-early\u201d intervention, it must accordingly be ensured that it provides for a clear definition of such risks as well as the corresponding risk threshold.","2272":"The need for a market-wide tool can best be illustrated with the example of gatekeeping scenarios in the platform economy. As outlined in our response to question no. 18.8, the size of a user base (even regarding a limited target audience), the capture of a large share of total revenue of the market and\/or even a situation of very few alternative services available on the market \u2013 does not automatically solidify the gatekeeper status of an online platform company. Each company may be open to negotiate their terms and conditions with business users in order to consider the needs of the other side. Each company may choose an \u201eopen system\u201c e.g. allowing users to easily port their data or switch between services. Especially when a proprietary system is cemented and a lock-in scenario arises, does this result in a bottleneck as well as barriers to entry for competitors.","2273":"Similar considerations can be applied to constellations of vertical integration, where a \u2013 not necessarily dominant \u2013 company with market power in a core market may apply repeated strategies to extend its market position to related markets, by relying on large amounts of data. Companies at important junctions of data collection processes do not need to dominate a market in order to gain a critical amount of data in order to establish a lead over competitors in related markets.","2274":"Accordingly, such new tool should be limited in scope, more precisely it should be strictly limited to those markets that can be clearly linked to unambigious features of structural competitions problems. Any attempt to extend the scope of application will only complicate the challenge to adequately identify and define \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d and to determine a definite risk threshold (equally valid across diverse markets) as well as corresponding measures. ","2275":"As mentioned above, we have primarily experienced structural competition problems in \u201cdigital markets\u201d, but also in telecommunications markets, and we find that such markets should be covered by the new competition tool. However, we cannot definitely exclude that the tool would be useful if it were horizontal in nature. \nARD is of the opinion that the approach in the definition of \u201cdigital markets\u201d at the beginning of this questionnaire is an adequate starting point. The use of digital technologies in order to provide a service or a product opens doors to the abovementioned critical features.ARD is of the opinion that as part of a new competition tool it would be necessary to enable the competent authority to adequately select from a toolbox of graduated regulatory measures. ","2276":"However, the power to make non-binding recommendations to companies should not be part of that toolbox. When the high threshold of a \u201cstructural competition problem\u201d is met, the competent authority should not \u2013 or due to reasons of proportionality even be forced to \u2013 resort to non-binding action. Certain markets with structural competition problems, such as digital markets, are moving at a fast pace, rendering non-binding recommendations to companies inadequate to quickly resolve the structural competition problems. For example, drafting voluntary codes of conduct and best practices would be a lengthy exercise and entail high monitoring costs, while they may not immediately deliver the desired outcome.","2277":"Apart from that, the other abovementioned measures would be generally useful, but should be applied to achieve an adequate balance between the clearly identified structural competition problem and the degree of intervention in line with the principle of proportionality. Accordingly, to inform and make recommendations \/ proposals to sectorial regulators could be the first step, while the imposition of (especially structural) remedies on companies to deal with identified and demonstrated structural competition problems should only be applied as ultima ratio when other measures fail. However, since there still remains uncertainty as to how the Commission imagines the mechanism of informing and making recommendations\/proposals to sectorial regulators, we would ask the Commission to provide further information about this option in the future.","2278":"Lastly, we would like to point out that as a result of an investigation under a new competition tool, it should always be considered whether certain issues would be best addressed by regulation.\nAs mentioned above (please refer to our response to question no. 30.1.), ARD is of the opinion that as part of a new competition tool it would be necessary to enable the competent authority to adequately select from a toolbox of graduated regulatory measures. ","2279":"Additionally, we suggest that in line with Article 9(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2003, the Commission should, upon request or on its own initiative, always be competent to reopen the commitments proceedings where there has been a material change in any of the facts on which the decision was based, where the undertakings concerned act contrary to their commitments, or where the decision was based on incomplete, incorrect or misleading information provided by the parties. We find that the Commission should have the same powers when it imposes remedies under the new competition tool.","2280":"However, as mentioned above (please refer to our response to question no. 30.1.), the imposition of structural remedies on companies to deal with identified and demonstrated structural competition problems should only be applied as ultima ratio when other measures fail.In ARD\u2019s view, investigative powers in order to gain information about different structural competition problems are key to the effectiveness of a new competition tool. Just like the detection of infringements of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU has grown ever more difficult, the detection of \u201estructural competition problems\u201c will pose entirely new difficulties. Only a comprehensive information base will enable the competent authority to fully grasp whether a \u201estructural competition problem\u201c even exists and how it has an impact on the relevant market. This is especially true as regards the relevant digital assets of companies (please refer to our response to question no. 33.3.).","2281":"Furthermore, the regulatory framework of the new competition tool should be reconciled with already existing regulation in this regard (please refer to our response to question no. 33.3.).First of all, we consider it necessary to ensure that the investigative powers in relation to a new competition tool are reconciled with the \u201ePowers of Investigation\u201c in Chapter V of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2003. Such need for reconciliation concerns all hereafter mentioned questions of the institutional set-up of a new competition tool, e.g. the possibility to impose interim measures or the possibility to accept voluntary commitments by the companies.","2282":"In this respect, investigative powers should only be aimed at companies deemed responsible for the causation of suspected \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d.\nInsofar, the powers to address requests for information to companies, to interview company management and personnel and to carry out inspections at companies as well as the power to impose fines in cases of non-compliance. Moreover, the expressly mentioned power to obtain expert opinions in each individual investigation may provide the competent authority with further independent input in deciding over suspected \u201estructural competition problems\u201c. ","2283":"However secondly, we would like to emphasise that the powers to address requests for information to and to carry out inspections at companies should explicitly include the powers to audit the relevant digital assets, e.g. the algoritms and data collection mechanisms being used (as well as the collected data). There is no doubt that the use of certain digital tools provides the respective companies with clear advantages. At the same time, these technically complex tools and their application are not adequately comprehensible \u201cfrom the outside\u201d, but require an in-depth auditing through technically adept experts. In order to safeguard the relevant trade secrets, auditing may take place in-camera.In ARD\u2019s view, the new competition tool should be subject to binding legal deadlines, but only as regards the obligations to cooperate of the companies under investigation (as well as the possibilities to comment by other market players). Due to the fact that the abovementioned \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d may to a significant extent arise in markets of the internet economy which are volatile, dynamic and develop at a fast pace, there is a certain need to act quickly in case of a sufficiently concrete initial suspicion. Parties concerned should not be in the position to impede (the outcome of) investigations through delaying tactics. In this respect, the failure to comply with a binding legal deadline should in some cases even be sanctioned with a fine.","2284":"However, the evaluation of the existence of \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d may even be more complex then to determine infringements of competition law. Accordingly, the authority should be given an appropriate deadline to perform this task with the necessary diligence.\nYes, the new competition tool should include the possibility to impose interim measures in order to pre-empt irreparable harm for the same reasons already mentioned above (please refer to our response to question no. 34.1.).","2285":"Additionally, we would like to reiterate that we consider it necessary to ensure that the the institutional set-up of a new competition tool is reconciled with the requirements in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2003. Under its Article 8 Regulation 1\/2003, in cases of urgency due to the risk of serious and irreparable damage to competition, on the basis of a prima facie finding of infringement, interim measures can be ordered.In ARD\u2019s view, the new competition tool should include the possibility to accept voluntary commitments by the companies operating in the markets concerned to address identified and demonstrated structural competition problems, thereby being reconciled with the legal framework in Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2003. ","2286":"In this respect, the competent authority should \n\u2022\tequally make those commitments binding on the undertakings by decision, and \n\u2022\tunder certain circumstances should also be able, upon request or on its own initiative, to reopen the proceedings, impose a fine (compare Article 23(2)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2003) or even compulsorily enforce the commitment.ARD is of the opinion that giving companies operating in the markets concerned, or suppliers and customers of those companies the possibility to comment on the findings of the existence of a structural competition problem before the final decision is expedient. ","2287":"Taking into consideration, that the new competition tool is supposed to tackle competition problems with a \u201cstructural\u201d dimension, it is of vital importance to understand whether there is an extensive concernment across a relevant market. Making use of investigative powers against responsible companies alone will not provide the competent authority with the necessary information to follow through with needed action, especially when these companies do not have an interest to provide information. Moreover, the questions in this consultation have demonstrated that it is rather difficult in practice to identify such problems on an abstract level. Any more targeted approach in an investigation will enable market players to further specify concrete challenges and problems. ","2288":"Additionally, it once again seems useful to reconcile the mechanism with already existing regulation (in this case compare Article 17(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2003).In accordance with our response to question no. 37.1., we think that during the proceedings the companies operating in the markets concerned, or suppliers and customers of those companies should also have the possibility to comment on the appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies. ","2289":"Just like it is important to understand whether there is an extensive concernment across a relevant market in order to determine the \u201estructural\u201c dimension of a competition problem, it is useful to double check of envisaged measures are indeed suitable to tackle that problem.In ARD\u2019s view, adequate procedural safeguards, especially including a judicial review through the EU courts, on a case-by-case basis are prerequisites in order to comply with the requirements of European fundamental rights and the rule of law. This is especially true for cases of potential structural remedies.In ARD\u2019s opinion, there is a need for a combination of the options 2 to 4. ","2290":"First and foremost, there is a need for an additional ex ante-regulatory framework imposing obligations and prohibitions that are generally applicable to all \u2013 not only \u201elarge\u201c \u2013 online platforms with gatekeeper power, that simultaneously allows for the possibility to impose tailored remedies on these platforms on a case-by-case basis. ARD would like to reiterate its preference of the policy option of revising the P2B-Regulation by adding these additional provisions.","2292":"The Technology Industries of Finland (TIF) is an association for companies in the metals \nindustry, the mechanical engineering and metal products industry, the electronics and \nelectrotechnical industry, the information technology industry and consulting \nengineering.

It is important to ensure \nequal preconditions for companies to access markets and operate there without threat of \nother market actors abusing their market power and distorting competition. Fragmentation \nof  legislation  is  not  desirable,  instead  the  competition  rules  should  be  examined \ncomprehensively. Otherwise, there is a risk of non-uniform and unjust enforcement and \nconsequently inequal operating possibilities for companies.  ","2294":"The  EU  Treaty  articles  101  and  102  referred  to  in  the  consultation  questionnaire  have \nproven well-functioning and applicable in different markets. Introducing new rules without \nrobust evidence of the need should be avoided. TIF considers that the structural problems \nbrought forward in the consultation are solvable with the present rules. These rules can \nbe  further  reinforced  and  particularised  e.g.  with  updated  guidelines.  It  is  of  utmost \nimportance to secure the SMEs\u2019 scope of operation against unfair competition.

It  is  necessary  to  define \nbeforehand  clearly  and  openly  the  contents  and  limits  of  the  rights  and  powers  of  the \nAuthority.  The  safeguards  for  the  companies,  who  would  be  targets  for  the  Authority\u2019s \nmeasures, must be defined. In this respect, the Commission proposal is clearly lacking.  ","2296":"The definition and criteria for the structural competition problems are vague.  The use of \nAuthority  imposed  structural  remedies  without  evidence  of  competition  infringement  is \nhighly questionable. From the company point of view, this procedure should include the \npossibility for appeal which again would slow down the process. If the Competition Tool is \nbe taken into use, the structural remedies should be excluded as a sanction. ","2297":"The Technology Industries of Finland finds the evidence for the need of a New Competition \nTool inadequate. The present legislation works well, even though the processes might be \ntime-consuming. The proper market investigation on the other hand gives the companies \nlegal security.

New ways of looking at the \ncompetition situation in markets for digital technologies are needed, as they are in some \nways different from traditional markets. And new instruments or tools for regulating these \nmarkets are necessary where they do not provide for a fair interaction between supply and \ndemand side agents.

These claims are subsequently used to push the user into buying more \nsoftware than they need, of a type that the vendor is trying to increase its \nmarket share in. We see this unwanted behaviour started at the larger \nsoftware vendors, but more and more suppliers are copying this approach. ","2306":"\u22c5  Current competition rules (i.a. articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the \nFunctioning of the European Union) apply predominantly to competition \nbetween suppliers. They don\u2019t very well apply to situations where a supplier \nhas been chosen by a customer and the customer subsequently finds that the \nsupplier is displaying undesirable and possibly unfair behaviour, while the \noptions available to redress this are unavailable.

It represents approximately 720 member companies whose combined business endeavors account for the bulk of French publishing and whose total turnover was amounted to 2.6 billion \u20ac in 2018 (3.6 billion \u20ac expressed at the retail selling price). The SNE represents the French publishing profession as a member of the Federation of European Publishers (FEP) whose position on this initiative it fully supports. \nA total of about 45.000 new titles were issued by French publishers in 2018 and approximately 15,000 people are employed full time in book publishing in France.\nPublishers provide the finance necessary to transform a writer\u2019s work into a manufactured book (or digital product). This process involves a series of costs: it is the publisher\u2019s job to assume these costs and to discharge them. A publisher therefore has a role similar in kind to a movie producer or a theatre impresario. Someone has to shoulder the financial risk of a project, manage that risk and turn it into a profit. That someone is the publisher.\nIn the European Union, the publishing industry adds up to tens of thousands of publishing houses. European publishing is a world leader, the only knowledge and entertainment sector where this is so. Most of the world\u2019s largest publishing conglomerates are European.\nIn no other comparable industry does Europe outrank the United States: indeed many major American publishing houses are owned by European multi-nationals. European publishing ranges from tiny enterprises employing a proprietor and one or two others to enormous international businesses employing many thousands of people. It is the means by which culture, literature, scholarship, science, technology and professional information are conveyed to the world.","2309":"Publishers provide books in a digital format, whether as ebooks or audiobooks. However, to provide this content to the public they rely on other commercial actors, such as e-books sellers, e-commerce marketplaces or app stores, to distribute the books.Publishers provide physical books that can be purchased online but also books in a digital format, whether as ebooks or audiobooks. To provide this content to the public, they rely on other commercial actors, such as e-books sellers, e-commerce marketplaces or app stores, to distribute the books.Vertical integration : Amazon, for example, is the biggest retail platform for books globally but is also a publisher, distributor and an own-brand label in its own right, compounding concerns about its gatekeeper status as a retailer and the resultant anti-competitive effects upstream. This integration leads to a conflict of interest regarding product promotion, as the online service gives greatest prominence to its own books and retail data can be shared upstream to inform product development.  ","2310":"Amazon\u2019s scale of operation and share of the market for book distribution has reached the point that no publisher can afford to be absent from its online store. This is especially true for smaller publishers and in the context of multi-territorial retailing. Amazon\u2019s market dominance allows it to dictate the economic terms of its relationships with suppliers. It is notable that Amazon has previously been subject to an EU Commission antitrust investigation (June 2015) which looked at its ebook distribution arrangements. In May 2017, the Commission accepted Amazon\u2019s commitments to change some of the contracting terms with ebook publishers. It is worth noting, however, that while most favoured nation clauses have been removed from contracts, the effect has been net zero due to Amazon\u2019s monopsony power position. These clauses can be triggered without being present in contracts due to the commercial structure of the market. ","2311":"Accumulation and use of personal and commercial supplier data : In the publishing sector, publishers working with some of the largest online marketplaces are currently unable to access data relating to their own titles to which the service has access. They do not have sufficient information to make sense of click-through rates or conversion rates on the best-selling titles and cannot adapt accordingly.","2312":"Lack of market transparency, inequalities in bargaining power and anti-competitive practices lead to market distortions with negative effects on the competitiveness of the supply chain as a whole. The current situation has an adverse effect as the diversity of channels of distributions in the book market is challenged, especially where online retail is concerned, thus weakening European cultural diversity.","2313":"A \u201cfear factor\u201d applies particularly as publishers are confronted to a limited number of players that represent a significant market share, making it virtually impossible for a publisher to seek fairer terms or some sort of redress, for fear of having their products delisted, not adequately promoted or labeled as no longer available, which would be detrimental to their business as well as misleading for the consumer. ","2314":"Publishers observed a number of unfair practices aimed at transferring the commercial risk to the publisher and effectively ensuring that no other bookseller can undercut the dominant online retailer. For instance one online retailer asks publishers to send the books to be delivered before a certain time very early in the morning which forces publishers to use night services which costs much more. Failing with this will result in being classified as \u201cbooks will be delivered after 2 weeks\u201d which dissuade buyers from buying the book, whereas the delay is a matter of hours, not weeks.See answer to question 6.","2316":"Aggressive acquisition strategies : In Amazon\u2019s case, it acquired Audible for $300m in 2008 \u2013 a move which allowed unprecedented consolidation in the audiobook market.Practical evidence shows this has been the practice of platforms since the beginning, some of them having started with books and then having added other subsectors. \nSee answers to question 6 on the inability for publishers to choose to not be present on these platforms, thus facilitating unfair trade practices.Strong regulation is required to ensure that fair, competitive markets remain and that the negative impacts of omnipotent online platforms (where they exist) are tackled promptly and decisively. This is especially necessary to correct the current abuses of dominant position and tax rules.","2317":"In addition, the respect of the principle of interoperability should be given a legal force, so that consumers may be free to choose their device without being restricted in their choice of content by retailers. Interoperability is a factor for the development of the e-book market, as it create the conditions for a competitive environment fostering the diversity of digital publishing actors. From a consumer\u2019s perspective, interoperability can improve their experience and facilitate the adoption of formats or standards allowing the development of a legal offer as well as accessibility of e-books by disabled persons. ","2318":"In order to break closed ecosystems, the principle should cover 3 objectives : \nFirst, to impose the supply of homothetic e-books (therefore excluding enhanced e-books, applications, future innovating proprietary formats and software) exclusively in an open format. \nSecond, to ensure consumers the same \u201cuses\u201d of an e-book acquired from whichever retailer, and therefore: \n-\tInteroperability should not have for consequence to deprive technological protection measures (TPMs) from their capacity to manage the usage rights;\n-\tTPMs linked to a file should not only be compliant with a single reading environment, as it is currently the case for e-books sold in the Apple ibookstore. In this case, other suppliers of e-book files and reading service providers should be able to require them to provide the information that is necessary for the purpose of interoperability. \nFinally, to ensure that files may be exported to any digital environment. ","2319":"Today all the elements for an interoperable system for e-books exist, including: an open standard (ePUB), as well as interoperable TPMs, including  LCP (Licensed Content Protection) developed by the consortium which elaborated ePUB. The big international e-book distributors (Amazon, Apple) which do not supply consumers with e-books in an ePUB format cannot justify it on technical grounds.

Against  this  background,  the  introduction  of  the  NCT  is \nbound to have far-reaching implications \u2013 far beyond those of established investigation and \nsector  inquiry  tools  \u2013  and  is  likely  to  result  in  a  paradigm  shift  in  EU  competition  law \nenforcement.

Lacking  any  data-related  revenues,  \u2018potential  competition\u2019  may \nrepresent an additional proxy to evaluate market power or even dominance.

","2367":"The  NCT  seems  to  envision  a  lowering  of  the  legal  and  evidentiary  standard  for \nintervention  so  as  to  allow  the  Commission  to  intervene  and  impose  remedies  vis-\u00e0-vis \nunilateral  conduct  \u201cwithout  any  prior  finding  of  an  infringement  pursuant  to  Article  102 \nTFEU,\u201d36 by undertakings that are not dominant on a relevant market.37  ","2368":"We understand that, to some extent, the justification for easing the legal and evidentiary \nburden  appears  to  rest  on  a  supposed  ability  to  foresee  developments  in  ever-moving  and \ndynamic markets, and in which outcomes are fundamentally unpredictable.  However, there \nis  a  real  risk  that  the  Commission\u2019s  proposals,  if  enacted,  would  result  in  a  significant \ndeviation  from  the  legal  and  evidentiary  standards  for  intervention  as  established  by \nfundamental  European  Union  law  and  the  CJEU  case  law,  which  foster  an  evidence-led \napproach that is subject to clear standards and judicial review.  ","2369":"On  this  point,  we  believe  further  analysis  is  needed  on  the  appropriateness  and \ndesirability of allowing the Commission to impose remedies on companies. An alternative \nmay  be  to  limit  the  Commission  powers  to  making  non-binding  recommendations  to \ncompanies, as well as to inform and make recommendations and proposals to sectorial \nregulators, and to make legislative recommendations.  Such an alternative could avoid or \nreduce the risk of a disproportionate interference with the free market economy that could \nhave a detrimental effect on the EU economy and consumers, as it could potentially stifle \ninnovation, growth and investment. ","2370":"This risk is heightened by the vagueness of the NCT\u2019s proposal. For instance, the NCT \nQuestionnaire  makes  reference  to  an  imprecisely-defined  concept  of  \u201ctipping  markets\u201d  \u2013 \nwhich constitutes one of the NCT\u2019s key focus areas \u2013 and to cases where \u201ca (not necessarily \ndominant) company [is] relying on large amounts of data\u201d \u201cto extend its market position to ","2371":" \n \n                                                 \n\frelated  markets\u201d. 38    However,  the  available  consultation  documents  do  not  contain  a \nprescriptive list of scenarios for intervention.  Therefore, the notion that certain markets are \nprone to \u2018tipping,\u2019 whereby the \u2018winner takes most,\u2019 appears to be a particularly speculative \nground  for  the  introduction  of  a  new  far-reaching  and  highly  invasive  enforcement  tool, \nespecially because there is scarcely any enforcement practice relating to \u2018tipping,\u2019 let alone \ncase law from the CJEU.  Conversely, the NCT seems to conflate \u2018tipping\u2019 with successful \norganic growth as a result of competition on the merits and innovation.39  ","2372":"In light of this, imposing remedies to avoid markets tipping would seem unjustified and \npremature, ultimately resulting in a reversal of the burden of proof that would fundamentally \nchange EU standards of due process and create legal uncertainty.  This in turn would reduce \ncompanies\u2019 incentives to compete, invest and innovate.  However, if, despite the described \nshortcomings,  the  Commission  decides  to  move  forward  with  this  new  tool,  it  should  be \naccompanied by appropriate safeguards, rights of defense and due process, as set out above40 \nand  by  a  robust  effects-based  analysis  ensuring  that  any  remedies  imposed  are  absolutely \nnecessary, proportionate, properly designed and capable of addressing any perceived issues. ","2373":"Indeed,  despite  the  fact  that  \u201cthe  Commission  would  not  make  any  finding  of  an \ninfringement  of  the  EU  competition  rules,  nor  impose  fines  and  thus  not  generate  rights  to \nlaunch damage claims\u201d41 the Commission\u2019s intervention through the NCT could have a vast \neconomic impact on the concerned undertaking.  Indeed, the imposition of behavioral and\/or \nstructural remedies can have a much greater impact than a pecuniary fine, resulting in radical \nchanges to undertakings\u2019 business models and\/or the restructuring of entire industries.  ","2374":"Moreover, the Commission\u2019s NCT Impact Assessment states that \u201cthe proportionality of \nthe  costs  incurred  would  be  ensured  by  the  fact  that  such  remedies  have  to  be  limited  to \nensuring the proper functioning of the market under scrutiny. Consumer benefits deriving from \nthe timely intervention under all policy options should outweigh those costs.\u201d42  This calls for \na vigorous effects-based economic assessment in order to achieve a trade-off by weighing the \nevidence  of  the  extent  and  nature  of  any  perceived  anticompetitive  effects  caused  by  the \n\u201cstructural risks for competition\u201d and\/or \u201cstructural lack of competition,\u201d against the impact \non various types of consumer benefits from a particular course of conduct, and then assessing \nthe costs\/benefits of  any intervention.

This happens in all kinds of markets \nand  sectors  of  the  economy  (not  only  in  digital  sectors)  and  it  is  most  often \nprocompetitive (for instance, incumbent operators or simply strong operators in \none energy market - electricity- extend its activities to the gas sector or viceversa, \nin  the  telecoms  &  media  sector  -fix  telephony,  afterwards,  mobile  telephony, \nfurther internet, then media content, etc.; all in all: same companies using their \nclient  portfolio  to  enlarge  the  range  of  products  offered  and  that  are  usually \nacquired by those same clients).  ","2410":"Strategies to operate in related markets are also inherent to platform business \nmodels,  which  consist  of  connecting  different  but  interdependent  set  of  users, \nfostering complementarities and creating value across multi-sided settings. Every \ncompany  can,  and  should  be  encouraged  to,  legitimately  make  use  of  its \ncompetitive advantages to enter and compete in other markets to the extent that \nits conduct does not foreclose competitors in an anticompetitive way. Competition \nlaw and economics generally view vertical integration as a source of efficiencies \n(e.g. the Commission\u2019s Guidelines on non-horizontal mergers). In some cases, \ndominant companies may seek to extend their market power via different means \nof  anticompetitive  leveraging.  There  is  established  case  law  and  experience \nregarding  the  circumstances  in  which  those strategies may  be anticompetitive. \nCompetition authorities have a proven track-record of flexibility and success in \naddressing this kind of strategies. ","2411":"Many companies with or without market power in all sectors of the economy often \ntry  to  enter  adjacent\/neighbouring  markets.  The  case  law  offers  examples  of \ninstances  of  such  strategies,  and  offers  guidance  as  to  their  legality  (e.g. \nMicrosoft, Commercial Solvents, Tetra Pak, Telemarketing, Deutsche Telekom, \nWanadoo, etc.). Even in  less  sophisticated markets,  that do not  seem  to  pose \ncompetition concerns so far, such as supermarkets, it is very frequent to see that \nretailers become \u201cmanufacturers\u201d of their own products and compete with their \nsuppliers of branded products. See also some examples provided above in the \ntelecom & media sector. ","2412":"As explained in the response to 8.2, strategies to operate in related markets are \nalso inherent to platform business models, which consist of connecting different \nbut interdependent set of users, fostering complementarities and creating value \nacross multi-sided settings. In addition, the narrow market definitions adopted in \nmany digital markets may facilitate the definition of a variety of closely connected \nmarkets which, in turn, might facilitate the identification of \u201cleveraging\u201d. Providing \ncomplementary  services  across  markets  is  one  of  the  ways  in  which  digital \ncompanies and ecosystems may compete and create value for users. Whether \nthese strategies are ultimately pro- or anti-competitive needs to be assessed in \nlight  of  the  relevant  economic  and  legal  context  to  every  strategy  and  market. \nMaking wrong assumptions either way can be costly for society.  ","2413":"Moreover within the context of a possible NCT which is does not seem to subject \nto the limits and procedural safeguards of articles 101 and 102 TFEU, making \nwrong assumptions may reduce certainty and attractiveness for investors in the \nEU in digital markets (which is precisely one of the areas in which the EU has a \ncompetitive disadvantage). ","2414":"The  question  is  unclear.  In  view  of  the  respondents,  the  Commission  should \nprovide a clear definition of what is meant by the notion of \u201cmarket power\u201d as it \nseems  to  set  a  new  threshold  for  intervention  different  from  that  of  \u201cdominant \nposition\u201d  set  out  in  Article  102  TFEU.  The  same  applies  to  the  expression  of \n\u201cextension of market power\u201d, which in itself is vague and imprecise. Moreover, \nrespondents  also  find  questionable that  the  concerns  the  NCT should address \nonly relate to a \u201crepeated strategy\u201d, excluding one-time strategies from dominant \ncompanies\/companies with market power aimed at extending such power in their \nown or other markets.  ","2415":"The  European  Commission  and  every  other  competition  authority  and  court \nshould  be  able  to  intervene  in  the  face  of  risks  of  anticompetitive  leveraging. \nExperience shows that competition authorities currently enjoy the powers to do \nso under the coverage of articles 101 & 102 TFEU and through additional tools \n(merger  control,  sectorial  enquiries,  commitment  decisions  under  aticle  9  of \nRegulation 1\/2003). ","2416":"EU and national courts have developed flexible standards based on \u201cimprecise \nlegal  concepts\u201d  (see  Case  T-167\/08,  Microsoft,  para.  91)  that  have  been \nreplicated around the world and that enable authorities to intervene in the face of \nrisks  that  a  conduct  may  be  \u201ccapable\u201d  of  \u201cpotentially\u201d  restricting  competition. \nUnder  these  provisions,  the  Commission  also  has  the  powers  to  impose \nbehavioural or structural remedies. Under Art. 9 of Regulation 1\/2003, moreover, \nthe  Commission  enjoys  the  power  to  make  binding  behavioural  or  structural \ncommitments, even when disproportionate to the competition concerns at issue. ","2417":"The experience gained across thousands of cases in virtually all sectors is also \nextremely helpful to understand the circumstances in which Articles 101 and 102 \nshould not intervene. Lack of enforcement in certain situations is not necessarily \nexplained  by  the  insufficiency  of  the  tools,  but  because  of  the  existence  of \nimportant reasons not to deploy them.  ","2418":"Deterrence. Some members take the view that the system of remedies (based \neminently  on  fines)  may  not  always  have  been  historically  sufficient  to  deter \nrepeat offenders. There is, however, a view that the increase in damages actions, \nthe  increase  in  the  level  of  fines  and  greater  reputational  damage  may  now \nreduce this perceived shortcoming.  ","2419":"Remedies. Some members have also pointed out that remedies should be better \ndesigned.  If the  Commission\u2019s objective  is to  regulate  markets and  create and \nadminister intrusive remedies along the lines of ex ante access obligations, then \nthere is ample consensus that competition law would not be well-suited and ex-\nante legislation (with clear cut obligations and prohibitions ensuring predictability) \nshould be adopted. The experience of the UK market investigations regime in, for \nexample,  retail  banking,  shows  that  remedies  can  eliminate  obstacles  to \ncompetition (e.g. by facilitating switching and interoperability) without intruding on \ncomplex  business  models  or  market  structures.  However,  also  like  in  the  UK, \nstrong safeguards and balances should be adopted within the context of these \nprocedures (hearings, public reports, consultations, etc.). ","2420":"Duration  of  investigations.  Whereas  the  length  of  enforcement  proceedings \nmight also be a problem in some cases (also in non-digital scenarios), this is a \nrisk that may have been somewhat overstated (there are no clear examples of \ncases  where  swifter  enforcement  would  have  had  brought  about  meaningful \nchange)  and  that  could  be  addressed  via  the  welcome  re-use  of  interim \nmeasures. There is ample consensus among our members that justifying a new \ncompetition  tool  on  the  basis  of  this observation  could  lead  to  an  overlap  with ","2421":"   The  creation  of  informal  forums  where  companies  and  competition \nauthorities  could  exchange \nregarding \ncontemplated  or  current  business  practices  could  also  avoid  certain \nproblems  while  resulting  in  somewhat  greater  legal  certainty.  A  more \nproactive  use  of  sectorial  enquiries  and  general  recommendations,  as \nwell as commitment decisions could be better suited to address structural \nproblems.  ","2422":"If the Commission finally decides to opt for a new competition tool (which \nis an option the respondents do not support), we propose that this tool is \nlimited to clearly identified competition concerns in each case (regardless \nof  the  specific  economic  sector;  i.e.,  no  \u201cdigital  only\u201d)  and  is  limited  to \npermanent  market  structure  problems.  If  the  concerns  mainly  refer  to \nbehavioural aspects, they should be treated under arts. 101 & 102 TFEU, \nwhich ensure a deeper analysis on a case-by-case basis and with all the \nprocedural,  legal  and  economic  guarantees  that  the  new  tool  does  not \nseem to envisage at this stage. ","2423":"Anticompetitive  monopolisation  can  occur  in  traditional  markets  where  an \naspiring  monopolist  prevents  competitors\u2019  products  from  reaching  consumers. \nFor example, this could occur in the consumer products\u2019 sector when misusing a \ncategory  manager  position  at  the  retail  level  (see  paras.  209-213  of  the \nCommission\u2019s  Guidelines  on  vertical  agreements).  Also  in  services  related \nmarkets  (for  instance  in  Spain,  using  clients  data  bases  created  for  supply  of \nenergy under a non-liberalised regime to render additional installing services and \nrefusing access to that data to competing installers: a case duly addressed under \ntraditional dominance \/article 102 TFEU provisions without the need of additional \ntools). ","2424":"Unilateral  anticompetitive  conducts  could  also,  to  some  extent,  occur  across \ndigital  markets,  where  IP  rights  play  a  relevant  role  and  there  are  important \nnetwork  effects.  For  example,  practices  designed  to  exclude  competitors  in \ntipping  markets:  a  platform  refusing  to  list  a  product  on  its  platform  which \ncompetes with the platform\u2019s own product, providing preferential treatment to its \nown products vis a vis that of rivals or reducing the attractiveness or functionality \nof rival products. For tipping markets, please see answers to Q16 below.  ","2425":"No,  unless  a  breach of  competition  law  is demonstrated under arts 101 & 102 \nTFEU or under the merger regulation test. Otherwise, the careful balance stricken \nbetween the principles of an open and free economy, legal certainty and the limits \nimposed to dominant players whenever they abuse of their market power would \nbe jeopardised.  ","2426":"In addition, establishing a threshold concerning market power can lead to a lot of \nfalse positives, which in rapidly growing models risk stifling promising business \nmodels.  Intervention  to  address  anticompetitive  monopolisation  would  only  be \njustified \nto  monopolize \nanticompetitively and if the predatory or anticompetitive conduct will most likely \nor almost certainly lead to achieving monopoly power. This would be very difficult \nto determine in advance.  ","2427":"Finally, apart from article 102 TFEU (see below), national unfair competition rules \ncould tackle some of these unilateral behaviours. For instance, behaviours that \nentail a breach of other regulations (patent, privacy, consumer protection laws, \netc.)  and  which  precisely  due  to  that  breach  the  company  gains  a  competitive \nadvantage, is a typical act covered by unfair competition laws. The same happens \nwith situations of abuse of \u201crelative\u201d situation of dependency (not an \u201cabsolute\u201d \nsituation  of  dominance  in  the  market,  but  specific  market  power  vis  -\u00e0-  vis  a \nsupplier or a client). Transforming potential infringements of regulatory regimes \nby  dominant  firms  or  firms  with  market  power  that  give  them  a  competitive \nadvantage in situations quasi equivalent to breaches of article 102 TFEU would \nnot probably pass the EU Courts\u2019 tests. Much less would it be appropriate to use \nsuch a dilutive concept to implement a new tool that does not meet the procedural \nstandards and safeguards of article 102 TFEU. ","2428":"In addition, article 102 TFEU has traditionally adapted to prevent anticompetitive \nunilateral  conduct.  In  this  respect,  the  EC  has  confronted  anticompetitive \nmonopolisation in the past by either imposing liability on the unilateral conduct of \nthe dominant firms even for conduct outside the market which they dominate or \nby narrowly defining relevant markets.  ","2429":"12.  An  oligopoly  is  a  highly  concentrated  market  structure,  where  a  few \nsizeable  firms  operate.  Oligopolists  may  be  able  to  behave  in  a  parallel \nmanner  and  derive  benefits  from  their  collective  market  power  without \nnecessarily  entering  into  an  agreement  or  concerted  practice  of  the  kind \ngenerally  prohibited  by  competition  law.  In  those  situations,  rivals  often \n\u2018move together\u2019 to e.g. raise prices or limit production at the same time and \nto the same extent, without having an explicit agreement. Such so-called \ncoordinated  behaviour  can  have  the  same  outcome  as  a  cartel  for \ncustomers, e.g. price increases are aligned. ","2430":"Strong incumbency advantages due to customers\u2019 switching costs and or inertia \nare  not  relevant  as  such  since  they  are  to  be  considered  barriers  to  entry  or \nbarriers to potential competitive pressure. The lack of transparency for customers \non best offers available in the markets should be regarded as a switching cost ","2431":"The fact that oligopolists compete in several markets may or may not increase \nthe risk of collusion. As a matter of fact, it will depend on the features of each \nparticular market. Vertical integration into key assets of the vertical supply chain \nis somewhat important. It will also depend on the features of each of the markets \nintegrated vertically. ","2432":"Tacit collusion in oligopolistic market situations can be tackled with the existing \ntools, enforcement of Articles 101 and 102, in a case by case scenario or in the \nalternative, with recommendations and sectorial enquiries or even in commitment \ncases where a breach of article 102 TFEU is possible but doubtful.  ","2433":"An  update  of  the  \u201cCommunication  from  the  Commission  \u2014  Guidelines  on  the \napplicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union \nto  horizontal  co-operation  agreements\u201d  in  order  to  better  define  facilitating \npractices,  particularly  in  new  environments  such  as  digital  sectors,  should  be \nconsidered in order to facilitate a uniform application of competition law in all the \nmember States. ","2434":"Firstly, algorithms are used in markets with certain degree of transparency. Price \nalgorithms  need  information  to  operate.  The  success  of  the  price  algorithm  in \npredicting  how  the  offer  and  demand  will  react  critically  depends  on  the \ninformation on what other competitors and clients are doing. In markets that are \nnot transparent, algorithms cannot successfully predict the behaviour of clients \nand competitors in order to set the right price that guarantees profitability.  ","2435":"Secondly,  algorithmic  pricing  is  particularly  useful  in  markets  where  there  is  a \nfrequent interaction between the supplier and the client. Algorithmic pricing allows \na dynamic adaptation of the prices to the particular circumstances of the market \n(including  the  prices  that  other  competitors  are  offering  for  similar  products). \nTherefore,  the  more  frequent  the  interaction  between  the  suppliers  and  their \nclients, the more useful becomes the use of a tool to adapt prices to the changing \ncircumstances of the market.  ","2436":"Participants  do  not  contemplate  the  possibility  or  not  of  aligning  prices  as  a \nfeature of markets where pricing algorithms typically operate. They observe that \nmarkets  that  are  not  candidate  prima  facie  for  an  alignment  in  prices  (non-\nconcentrated markets with differentiated products) have been intensively using \npricing algorithms (e.g. hotels). ","2437":"Algorithmic pricing can predict market trends, better adjust to demand and thus \ngenerate efficiencies and be procompetitive. However, the main concern from a \ncompetition  law  perspective  is  that  algorithmic  pricing  could  be  increasing  the \nlikelihood of tacit collusion even in markets that do not meet the requirement for \ncollusion  (non-concentrated markets  with differentiated products, for example). \nTacit  collusion  typically  results  into  higher  prices  and  less  choice  for \nconsumers.  ","2438":"Participants  agree  that  article  101  TFEU  has  proven  sufficient  to  address \nScenario  1.  In  the  participants\u00b4  view,  article  101  TFEU  is  flexible  enough  to \naddress similar cases in the future despite foreseeable challenges, essentially in \nterms of detection and proof. The Eturas case (C-74\/14) is a good example of \nadaptability  of  article  101  TFEU  to  new  scenarios  in  which  coordination  is \nfacilitated by IT (in this case, an electronic platform).   ","2439":"Participants also agree that a significant number of cases under Scenario 2 could \nalso be covered by article 101 TFEU. The user of the algorithm can be held liable \nunder article 101 TFEU for the acceptance of the use of collusive features in the \ndesign of the algorithm (liability per design). In can also be taken into account at \nthe stage of assessing the effects of, for instance, a vertical restraint put in place \nby  a  manufacturer  spreading  more  easily  due  to  the  generalised  use  of  price \nmonitoring algorithms by retailers (see, for instance, Cases AT. 40465 Asus, AT. \n40469 Denon & Marantz, AT. 40181 Philips, and AT.40182 Pioneer). ","2440":"Participants point out that the prohibition of an abuse of a (joint) dominant position \nunder  Article  102  TFEU  could  exceptionally  cover  some  cases  where  the \nconcertation in terms or article 101 TFEU cannot be established. However, they \nadmit  that  its  application  would  be  rather  exceptional  given  the  difficulties  in \nestablishing  both  the  existence  of  a  (joint)  dominant  position  and  the  abusive \npricing behaviour.  ","2441":"In some cases (provided that the Airtours conditions are met and the adoption of \nthe algorithm is seen as a facilitating practice), such conduct could be conceivably \ncovered by the prohibition of individual abuses of a collective dominant position \n(validated by the EU Courts in Irish Sugar). The US FTC relied on a similar theory \nof harm under Section 5 of the FTC Act in Ethyl, E.I Du Pont de Nemours c. FTC, \n729, F.2d 128 (2nd Cir. 1984). ","2442":"16. So-called tipping (or \u2018winner takes most\u2019) markets are markets where \nthe  number  of  users  is  a  key  element  for  business  success:  if  a  firm \nreaches  a  critical  threshold  of  customers,  it  gets  a  disproportionate \nadvantage in capturing remaining customers. Therefore, due to certain \ncharacteristics  of  that  market,  only  one  or  very  few  companies  will \nremain on those markets in the long term. ","2443":"Many markets exhibit positive externalities originating from direct or indirect \nnetwork  effects  and  many  companies  across  all  sectors  benefit  from \neconomies of scope and scale. The intensity of these features varies, but it \nmay  be  particularly  important  in  network  markets,  including,  e.g.  telecoms, \nenergy  or  transport.  Digital  markets  also  exhibit  these  features.  These \ncharacteristics  may  lead  to  some  degree  of  tipping.  The  degree  to  which \nmarkets may tip depends on product differentiation (one should be cautious \nabout  not  narrowing  down  relevant  markets  in  the  light  of  product \ndifferentiation, as this may often be parameter of competition), interoperability, ","2444":"Tipping may or may not be anticompetitive; there may be markets that can \nonly accommodate  a  limited  number of  firms  or markets  that  operate  more \nefficiently  with  a  limited  number  of  firms.  In  other  markets,  tipping  may  be \ntemporary and  may  act  as  an  incentive  to  spur  competition  for the  market. \nTipping may be a source of concern to the extent that there may be a risk of \n\u201clock-in\u201d  (i.e.  if  users  do  not  multi-home  and  face  technical  or  economic \nbarriers to switching). ","2445":"Furthermore,  there  should  not  be  a  presumption  that  companies  that  have \nbenefited from tipping effects will not be subject to competition. With hindsight, \ncompanies  that  10\/20  years  ago  seemed  unavoidable  have  now  almost \ndisappeared; also, in the technological sector. There is no reason to believe \nthat this can\/will not occur in time to present market leaders. ","2446":"Network effects, economies of scale and single-homing are necessary factors \nfor  tipping  to  occur,  single-homing  being  the  most  important.  For  anti-\ncompetitive tipping to occur, markets would also need to be characterized by \ntechnical  and  economic  high  barriers  to  switching\/multi-homing  and  lack  of \ndifferentiation.  Absent  these  barriers  or  even  absent  users  relevant  costs, \nsingle-homing  may  be  plausibly  explained  by  consumers  (and\/or  suppliers) \nunfettered choice. ","2447":"One should not lose sight of the fact that network effects, like economies of \nscale,  have  ambiguous  effects  on  competition:  they  may  be  a  source  of \nmarket  power,  but  they  may  also  be  a  source  of  value,  efficiency  and \nconsumer welfare. The assessment of whether their pro or anti-competitive \npotential prevails should be subject to a case-by-case determination.  ","2448":"All  of  the  concerns  identified  in  Q16.7  are  related  to  the  risk  of  \u201cpath \ndependency\u201d (i.e. that tipping and lock-in may lead to the entrenchment of a \nparticular  provider\/technology\/network  in  spite  of  its  possible  inferiority). \nWhether these concerns materialize or not is an empirical question. There are \nmarkets  often  identified  as  tipping  markets  that  nevertheless  exhibit  high \ndegrees  of  innovation,  R&D  investments,  quality  services  and  consumer \nsatisfaction. ","2449":"Similarly,  competition should  not  intervene  \u201cearly\u201d in markets before  tipping \noccurs. There  is no  evidence  that  public authorities\/private  companies may \nbe  able  to  predict  whether  tipping  is  likely  to  occur  in  a  given  market,  nor \nwhether tipping, in a given situation, might have positive or negative effects. \nAbsent a high degree of certainty, early intervention to prevent tipping might \nbe counterproductive. In addition, the possibility of early intervention absent \ndominance, and absent a restriction of competition may be problematic from \nthe  point  of  view  of  legal  certainty,  constitutional  elements  (right  to  free ","2450":"Competition  law  can,  and  should,  kick-with  full  strength  in  tipped  markets, \nwhere  the  leading  provider  will  be  subject  to  strict  \u201cspecial  responsibility\u201d \nobligations  to  compete  on the  merits  under  Article  102  TFEU in addition  to \nacross-the-board limitations under Article 101 TFEU.

They are nonetheless suitable and sufficiently effective \nto  preserve  competition.  For  a  new  competition  tool  to  be  adopted  out  of \nconcerns  about  tipping,  it  would  be  important  to  identify  examples  where  a \nnew competition tool could have been used to effectively prevent tipping in \nany  real-life  markets.  The  Impact  Assessment  Analysis  does  not  currently \noffer any such examples. ","2452":"Articles 101 and 102 have always applied to tipping markets. Already in 2002 \nsome authors observed that that \u201c[m]any antitrust decisions of the last decade \nrefer  to  the  existence  of  network  effects  as  a  clue  that  a  certain  degree  of \nintervention is needed\u201d (see e.g. Pardolesi & Renda, How safe is the king\u2019s \nthrone?

","2453":"The EU Courts have also been confronted to \u201ctipping\u201d arguments, including in \nMicrosoft (where the Commission observed a risk of tipping and made it an \nimportant part of the case) and Cisco (where, on the contrary, the Commission \nruled out the risk of tipping even in presence of strong network effects and \nvery limited multi-homing). The current competition law framework allows for \nthis evolving and nuanced approaches and gives the Commission sufficient \nmargin  of  manoeuvre  to  come  up  with  different  conclusions  in  different \nsettings. ","2454":"The Impact Assessment Analysis does not state that a New Competition Tool \nwould apply lower legal tests or evidentiary standards but does not state the \ncontrary either. If the Commission seeks to maintain similar standards, this is \nwelcome  and  should  expressly  indicate  it  so  in  the  future  regulation  and \nestablish  also  similar  procedural  safeguards.  However,  if  the  Commission \nseeks to lower standards of intervention and procedural safeguards this could \nrun the risk of conflicting with the established case law of the EU Courts. It will \ncreate  an  unsustainable  degree  of  uncertainty  for  current  (and  future) \ninvestors and partners in business, reducing future innovation and prosperity.

Some cases also exist \nin the media\/broadcasting rights sector (certain broadcasting rights that have \nbeen considered as a sort of essential facilities for pay tv; for instance, some \nfootball matches) ","2456":"The use of the term \u201cgatekeeper\u201d would need to be further defined, particularly \nto the extent that it may be invoked to justify an initiative of this relevance. The \nQuestionnaire  appears  to  consider  a  \u201cgatekeeper\u201d  as  particularly  important \nintermediaries  that  enable  business  operators  to  reach  customers.

","2460":"The fact that business operators need to accept the conditions of competition \nof the platform is inherent to most platforms, as well as to most distributors \nand business (see for instance an insurance or a financial entity as well any \nbusiness  with  mass  contracts  with  consumers).  The  ability  to  set  \u201cplatform \nrules\u201d is particularly important in multi-sided settings (either digital platforms \nor physical platforms: for instance auction operators such as Sotheby\u2019s, as a \nmere example).  ","2461":"Indeed,  economic  theory  (e.g.  Rochet  and  Tirole)  shows  that  the  role  of  a \nplatform  (and  we  do  not  see  why  a  difference  should  exist  between  digital \nplatforms and operators that connect offer and demand in off-line markets) is \nprecisely to set rules capable of attracting all sides, maximizing value while \npreventing  negative  externalities.  Competition  law  experience  reveals  that \nsecond-guessing  the  conditions  of  access  to  a  given  platform  or  asset  is \nfraught with difficulties. ","2462":"One  of  the  features  identified  in  Q18.7  refers  to  the  need  to  accept  the \nbusiness  conditions  of  the  platform  \u201cto  reach  the  customers  that  use  the \nspecific platform\u201d. The formulation of the question seems to conflate different \nquestions (i.e. customers that use the specific platform with customers in the \nrelevant market). The fact that a platform may somewhat have control over ","2463":"Any successful platform must be able to exercise some degree of control over \nthe competitive environment that it has created. Platform rules in these setting \nmay  be  positive  or  negative  from  a  welfare  standpoint.  Business  operators \nmay accept those conditions as the terms of access to the platform; they are \nlikely  to  do  so  only  when  access  to  the  platform  would,  overall,  be \nadvantageous to them.  ","2464":"When setting platform rules, platform sponsors need to balance the interests \nof all stakeholders in order to further the competitiveness of the platform as a \nwhole. Asymmetric treatment (e.g. skewed pricing) is inherent to this business \nmodels and is often their distinctive feature. Asymmetric treatment should not \nbe confused with discrimination. Similarly, the assessment of platform rules \nshould consider their effects on all sides of the platform.  ","2465":"Whether a given rule or restraint is permissible or not should be assessed by \nreference  to  the  competition  that  would  exist  in  a  realistic,  likely  and \neconomically  viable  counterfactual  and  having  regard  to  the  economic  and \nlegal  context  at  issue  in  every  case.  This  would  be  consistent  with  the \nestablished case law of the EU Courts in cases involving multi-sided business \nmodels,  such  as  Cartes  Bancaires,  Mastercard  and  Budapest  Bank. \nInterventions should only challenge platform conduct that restricts competition \nthat would have existed in their absence. ","2466":"The  main  concern  arising  from  genuine  \u201cgatekeeper\u201d  scenarios  is  that  of \n\u201coutput foreclosure\u201d (i.e. if business operators are prevented from accessing \ncustomers).  This  risk  should,  however  be  mitigated  by  the  fact  that  it  is \ngenerally in the platforms best interest to act as catalysts and create business \nopportunities for its stakeholders. Platforms should therefore generally have \nthe incentives to create value for all of the members of the ecosystem. ","2467":"As in the case of Q18.7, one of the features identified in Q18.9 refers to the \nneed to accept the business conditions of the platform \u201cto reach the customers \nthat  use  the  specific  platform\u201d.  The  formulation  of  the  question  seems  to \nconflate different questions (i.e. customers that use the specific platform with \ncustomers  in  the  relevant  market).  The  fact  that  a  platform  may  somewhat \nhave control over (exclusive or not-exclusive) access to its customers is not \nin itself problematic or the source of concerns. Problems may only arise when \nthe  platform  at  issue  controls  an  asset  that  is  indispensable  for  rivals  to \noperate viably in an adjacent market. ","2468":"The  European  Commission  should  retain  its  current  ability  to  intervene  in \ngatekeeper  scenarios  and  to  apply  the  law  on  the  bases  of  the  analytical \nframeworks set by the EU Courts. For enforcement to be more effective and \ntimely, we would call for competition authorities to enjoy greater resources. \nThere are no clear \u201cgatekeeper\u201d issues that are currently not addressed either \nby the competition rules or by regulatory initiatives, including the GDPR and \nthe Platform-to-Business Regulation.

The Commission has succeeded in challenging platform \nrestrictions  in  multi-sided  settings  in  a  variety  of  cases,  including  cases \ninvolving  Microsoft,  Google,  and  in  a  number  of  payment  card  cases.  The \nadoption  of  a  new  competition  tool  on  the  basis  of  \u201cgatekeeper\u201d  concerns \nwould require the clear identification of real life-cases where Articles 101 and \n1022 have fell short that currently do not appear to have been put forward.  ","2470":"Multi-sided  platforms  are  mainly  characterized  by  the  complexity  of  cross-\nmarket interactions. This may be a challenge for competition enforcement as \nit adds an additional layer of complexity. However, as recently emphasized by \nthe CJEU in Budapest Bank (C-228\/18, para. 80), the complexity inherent to \nthese settings does not justify relying on inadequate presumptions in either \ndirection; restrictions, like efficiencies, must be established by reference to the \nrelevant economic and legal context and a realistic counterfactual.  ","2471":"Moreover, if a new competition tool is finally established, it should be only for \nclear  and  undisputed  cases  where  the  accumulated  experience  (and  EU \ncourts  as  well  have  confirmed)  shows  that  they  give  rise  to  a  very  high \nlikelihood  of  anticompetitive  effects.  The  approach  would  be  similar  to  the \nconcept of restrictions \u201cby object\u201d that are prohibited \u201cper se\u201d under Art. 101 \nTFEU even if the conduct did not have effects. If a conduct or a situation is \nex-ante  subject  to  possible  intervention,  and  even  more,  to  possible \nenforcement  measures  and  remedies,  it  should  be  undisputed  that  this \nintervention is justified and has a preventive character of a loss for competition \nthat will very likely take place otherwise.

In light of your responses to the questions of Section C, do you think \nthat  there  is  a  need for  a  new  competition  tool  to  deal  with  structural \ncompetition  problems  that  Articles  101  and  102  of  the  EU  Treaty  (on \nwhich  current  competition  law  enforcement  is  based)  cannot  tackle \nconceptually or cannot address in the most effective manner? (Article ","2479":"101  of  the  EU Treaty  prohibits  agreements  between  companies  which \nprevent, restrict or distort competition in the EU and which may affect \ntrade  between  Member  States  (anti-competitive  agreements).  These \ninclude, for example, price-fixing or market-sharing cartels. Article 102 \nof  the  Treaty  prohibits  any  abuse  by  one  or  more  undertakings  of  a \ndominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of \nit.) ","2480":"Most of our members believe that Competition law, and particularly Articles \n101  and  102  TFEU,  are  effective  and  sufficiently  broad  and  flexible \ninstruments to fight against most competition problems \u2013 including structural \nones - arising in all sorts of markets, from traditional to most innovative ones. \nIn  our  answer  to  section  C  we  have  referred  to  many  precedents  affecting \ndigital markets (e.g. Microsoft, Cisco, Google cases, current investigations on \nApple activities, Amazon Marketplace, etc.) which show that market abuses \nand  restrictive  agreements  (either  horizontal  or  vertical)  can  be  effectively \ntackled by using current legislation and enforcement tools by the European \nCommission and by national Competition authorities.  ","2481":"Moreover,  in  relation  with  structural  competition  conditions  of  any  specific \nmarket, Merger Control mechanisms also play an important role, whenever a \nplayer tries to increase its power in any market by acquiring control over other \ncompanies (this is a very common way to proceed, as experience has showed \nin digital markets). ","2482":"Hence, effective protection of consumers and players in new digital markets \ncan  be achieved  through  the  enforcement  of  the  currently existing rules;  in \nparticular,  we  believe  that  the  currently  existing  rules  can  guarantee  an \nappropriate  balance  between  the  principles  of  an  open  and  free  economy, \nlegal  certainty  and  the  limits  imposed  to  dominant  players  whenever  they \nabuse  of  their  market  power  (acting  as  gatekeepers,  limiting  access  to \nessential  facilities  in  new  markets,  imposing  unfair  trading  conditions  to \nentrants or other players in the market, etc.). ","2483":"In particular, different legal tests have been developed by case law, especially \nin the field of abuse of dominance, to strike a delicate balance between i) the \nrestriction of rights of (even dominant) companies under national constitutions \nand the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \u201cCharter\u201d), \non  the  one hand, and  ii) the  need for public  intervention  to  avoid a  greater \nharm to the general interest in undistorted competition, on the other hand. An ","2484":"illustrative  example  is  provided  by  the  essential  facilities  doctrine,  which \nimposes stringent conditions (the so-called \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d) with \na view to pondering an intense interference on dominant companies\u2019 freedom \nto  conduct  a  business  (enshrined  in  Article  16  of  the  Charter)  as  is  the \nmandate  to  deal  against  the  greater  harm  represented  by  the  removal  of \neffective  competition  in  a  market.  We  are,  in  general,  afraid  that  a  new \ncompetition tool may tamper with this careful balance by lowering the standard \nfor intervention. ","2485":"Additionally,  although  it  is  true  that  some  structural  problems  may  exist  in \nmarkets where no dominant player can be identified, we believe this can be \nconsidered as an exceptional situation, as most markets where no dominant \nplayers  \u2013  either individual or collective  \u2013  can  be  identified  offer competitive \nsolutions to players and consumers.  ","2486":"As to the possible structural problems affecting specific markets, we believe \nthat the use if the new competition tool is in general not justified in view of the \nspecific  ex  ante  sectorial  regulation \nthe  European \nCommission. The existing ex-ante regulation could also be an effective tool, \nwhich  could  complement  the  current  competition  rules  (most  of  them  to  be \napplied ex post, in case of infringement of the rules by companies) and ensure \nthat  access  and  operation  in  these  markets  by  independent  players  is \ncompetitive  enough.  Again,  there  are  many  examples  of  successful \ncombination  of  ex  ante  sectorial  regulation  with  ex  post  enforcement  of \ncompetition law in the telecoms, energy, postal, financial or transport markets. \nWe believe this combination is an appropriate way to impose  \u2013 if needed \u2013 \nsome limits to players in the market, and at the same time providing them with \nlegal certainty as to their rights and obligations. The new tool would lead to \nand additional and, hence, disproportionate limitation and above all, a source \nof legal and economic uncertainty in these sectors that may reduce incentives \nto invest in them in the EU.  ","2487":"At this point, and for digital markets in particular -which seems to be one of \nthe main concerns and drivers of the proposed new tool- clearly the need for \nthe new tool cannot be analysed in isolation from the proposal of Digital \nServices  Act  package  that  is  subject  to  a  parallel  consultation  (the \n\u201cProposal\u201d).  ","2488":"   The AEDC is not making specific comments to the Proposal, although \n[many\/the  majority?]  of  the  members  that  participate  in  this  paper \nconsider that is not needed nor adequate for several reasons many of \nwhich coincide with the ones that leads us to believe that the new tool is \nnot necessary either.  ","2489":"   Nonetheless  if  the  Commission  were  finally  decided  to  adopt  such  a \nlegislative  package,  again,  there  would  be  a  duplicity  of  tools  and \noverlapping measures, whose combination and limits are very uncertain, \nfor digital markets in general, and more particularly for online platforms \nthat  in  the  Commission\u2019s view,  act  as  \u201cgatekeepers\u201d  (the  \u201cGatekeeper \nRules\u201d).  ","2490":"   As a mere example, the Proposal mentions that for Gatekeeper Rules, \nit could be possible to impose remedies \u201cwhere considered necessary \nand  justified  following  a  prior  assessment\u201d.    If  this  prior  assessment \nprocess  affects  more  than  one  company  and  is  closer  to  a  sectorial \ninvestigation, there is no real clear cut difference between this ex-ante \nnew regulation  and  the  scope  of  the  new competition tool.  Confusion, \nlegal  uncertainty  and  risk  of  duplicities  and  contradictory  approaches \nbetween these two ex-ante measures (one of regulatory character and \nthe other more optional but also of regulatory nature) should be avoided.  ","2491":"   Moreover,  if  the  Commission  follows  the  \u201cblacklist  option\u201d  for  the \nProposal, which would be the preferred one by the AEDC (if any), as it \nprovides more legal certainty and meets the goal of ex-ante regulation \n(i.e., prior identification of prohibited acts and obligations in markets with \nstructural  problems),  introducing  additional  uncertainty  and  burdens \nunder \ntool  would  be  unjustified  and \ndisproportionate. In fact, operators in digital markets would be subject to \nspecific  regulations  with  the  goal  to  prevent  ex-ante  competition  risks \nand also can be subject to additional ex-ante remedies and regulations \neven in cases of no infringement of competition laws (arts. 101 & 102 \nTFEU).  This  would  be  contradictory  and  a  demonstration  that  the  ex-\nante regulation has failed. Instead of introducing through the back door \nad-hoc  remedies  when  the  \u201cex-ante  regulations\u201d  have  not  worked  as \nthey were not well defined or did not cover an specific new ambit, what \nthe Commission should do is to review\/revisit on a regular basis such \nlegislative  ex-ante  legislative  package  and  adapt  it.  However,  the \nCommission  should  not  use  the  new  tool  as  a  sort  of  blanket  tool  to \ncorrect the gaps of its ex-ante regulation.  ","2492":"In this same line, and also concerning digital markets, the need for the \nnew tool should be analysed taking into account other pieces of ex-ante \nregulation which seek directly or indirectly to ensure that digital markets \nremain  competitive,  consumers  are  not  harmed  and  that  operators \n(including the so called, gatekeepers and online platforms) do not incur \ninto \u201cunfair\u201d practices (which is a test well below Art. 102 TFEU). Inter \nalia, we may refer to: ","2493":"o  Directive 2019\/2161, amending Council Directive 93\/13\/EEC and \nDirectives 98\/6\/EC, 2005\/29\/EC and 2011\/83\/EU of the European \nParliament and of the Council as regards the better enforcement \nand  modernisation  of  Union  consumer  protection  rules.  This \nDirective addresses relevant aspects that were supposed to be \n\u201cgaps\u201d under the new competition tool, such as rankings of offers \nin on-line marketplaces and on-line search results (whereas 17 to \n26), portability of personal data and of digital content...,  ","2494":"o  Regulation  (EU)  2019\/1150  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of \nthe  Council  of  20  June  2019  on  promoting  fairness  and \ntransparency for business users of online intermediation services. \nThis  regulation  establishes  clear  limits  of  possible  \u201cunfair \npractices\u201d by online intermediation service providers, which can \nbe  assimilated  to  a  large  extent  to  marketplaces  and  digital \nplatforms (see for instance, paragraph 2: \u201cGiven that increasing \ndependence, the providers of those services often have superior \nbargaining  power,  which  enables  them  to,  in  effect,  behave \nunilaterally in a way that can be unfair and that can be harmful to \nthe legitimate interests of their businesses users and, indirectly, \nalso  of  consumers  in  the  Union.  For  instance,  they  might \nunilaterally  impose  on  business  users  practices  which  grossly \ndeviate from good commercial conduct, or are contrary to good \nfaith and fair dealing. This Regulation addresses such potential \nfrictions  in  the  online  platform  economy\u201d.  Article  10  addresses \nMNF clauses.

As such, it cannot be used to \u201cfill the gaps\u201d,  but \nonly  as  last  resort  and  in  compliance  with  Art.  52  of  the  Charter.  This \nimplies, in particular, that it can only be used on condition that it complies \nwith the principle of proportionality. Accordingly: ","2496":"if there are other less restrictive means to achieve the same objectives \n-including the new Proposal of ex-ante regulation for digital markets or \nan  amendment  of  other  already  existing  ex-ante  regulations  in  other \nsectors  (telecoms,  energy,  etc.)-,  that  address,  in  full  or  in  part,  the \nproblems aimed  by  the  new competition tool,  the  latter  should not  be \nenforced. Otherwise, the new competition tool may be incompatible with \nthe proportionality and necessity test of art. 52 of the Charter; ","2497":"the drafting  of the new competition tool (if any) should clearly require \nthe  Commission  to  thoroughly  analyse  any  other  alternatives  to  the \nenforcement of the new competition tool and also to duly state reasons \neach  time  it  wishes  to  apply  it  indicating  why  the  Commission  has \ndiscarded the other alternative tools at its disposal (as mentioned, i.e., \nadapting  existing  ex-ante  regulation  or  introducing  new  one,  soft-law \ninquiries\/investigations,  commitment \nrecommendations,  sectorial \ndecisions  under  art.  9  of  Regulation  1\/2003,  merger  control  (if \napplicable) and above all, procedures under Arts. 101 or 102 TFEU. ","2498":"All  in  all,  based  on  the  above,  the  European  Commission  should  carefully \nconsider whether the new competition tool is indeed needed and, if so, clearly \nidentify the so-called \u201cgap cases\u201d that cannot be effectively analysed under \nArticle 101 and 102 TFEU -and in the worsk case scenario, for digital markets, \nalso with the new Proposal if finally adopted- and would justify an intervention \nthrough  this  new  tool.  In  particular,  the  European  Commission  should  be \ncautious while intervening in markets prone to \u201ctipping\u201d, which is one of the \nnew  competition  tool\u2019s  key  areas  according  to  the  Inception  Impact \nAssessment. In fact, tipping should not be regarded as anticompetitive per se \nand an early intervention, in the absence of dominance and a restriction of \ncompetition,  could  be detrimental for  innovation  and  competition  as  well as \nproblematic from a legal certainty standpoint. ","2499":"As indicated in answer to question 24, we believe there is no real need for a \nnew competition tool in order to effectively face most - if not all of them - of \nthe specific problems of emerging new markets, as current Competition Law \n(in  particular  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU,  but  also  Merger  Control \nmechanisms),  together  with  ex  ante  sectorial  regulation,  whenever  needed \n(as it is the case in Telecoms, Energy, Postal, Financial or Transport markets), \nhave demonstrated to be effective tools in order to tackle most structural and \nbehavioural restrictions of competition, either unilateral (abuses of unilateral \ndominant position) or multilateral (abuses of collective dominant position and \nrestrictive agreements between companies).  ","2500":"We  must  bear  in  mind  that  the  European  Commission  could  impose \nbehavioural  and  structural  remedies  under  the  current  regime  and  has  the \npower  to  make  them  binding  commitments  under  Article  9  of  Regulation \n1\/2003.  Article  9  does  not  require  to  establish  a  clear  cut  competition \ninfringement  (for  instance  a  clear  abuse  of  dominant  position)  but  a \nreasonable theory of harm and likely risk of competition. Only if the company \nconcerned is not wishing to provide remedies satisfactory to the Commission \nthe  latter  would  have  to  pursue  a  complete  infringement  case  for  imposing \nremedies.  Nonetheless,  Article  9  is  indeed  a  well  suited  mechanism  to \naddress some of the concerns that the Commission is pursuing with the new \ntool.  ","2501":"Structural  problems  have  been  identified  in  the  past  in  relation  with  many \nmarkets.  In  some  cases,  this  has  motivated  the  establishment  of  ex  ante \nregulation guaranteeing access and fair trade conditions in those markets (e.g \naccess  to  essential  energy  or  telecom  networks  and  facilities  which  are \nessential for the provision of services in downstream \/ retail markets).  In other \ncases, competition law has been applied whenever a dominant company has \nused  its  market  power  with  exploitative  or  exclusionary  purposes.  Some  of \nthese cases have motivated the imposition of behavioural or even structural \nremedies to parties \u2013 not only economic sanctions \u2013 which are effective tools \nto redress some of the structural problems identified.  ","2502":"In  any  event,  those  markets  that  are  more  prone  to  the  sort  of  structural \nproblems  that  come  to  mind  when  thinking  of  the  new  competition  tool \n(platform-based  digital  markets)  are  characterized  by  ambivalent  network \neffects.  Depending  on  a  complex  case-by-case analysis  of  switching  costs, \nindirect network effects may either create barriers to entry and expansion (i.e. \npositive feedback loop reinforcing strong brand effects and, in the worst-case \nscenario,  customer  lock-in)  or  make  large  market  positions  contestable \n(through  multi-homing  or  one-click-away  competition  in  the  presence  of ","2503":"portability and interoperability). These effects may play out one way or another \nand, therefore, its assessment should be related to a specific theory of harm \n(be it abusive leveraging or merger-specific significant impediment to effective \ncompetition). However, we are, in general, uncertain that such effects can be \njudged undesirable in abstract as a matter of structural characteristics of the \nmarket and justify intervention through the new competition tool. ","2504":"In case that the European Commission considers it necessary to introduce a \nnew competition tool, probably problems related to market access are those \nwhich  should  be  the  priority  of  such  new  instrument.  In  particular,  the \nEuropean  Commission  should  ensure  that  i)  there  is  an  unavoidable  (or  at \nleast very important) point of entry or bottleneck (as the market for client PC \noperating systems was deemed to be for access to the market for work group \nserver operating systems in the Microsoft case \u2013 not to mention more recent \ncases still under debate); ii) there are significant and permanent barriers to \nentry  and  expansion  in  the  bottleneck  (even  if  the  European  Commission \ndecides not to make dominance a requirement); and iii) effective competition \neither  in  the  bottleneck  market  or  for  the  adjacent  market  is  distorted  (e.g. \ndominant  company\u2019s  leveraging  the  in  the  bottleneck  market  or  self-\npreferencing  its  business  in  the  adjacent  market,  to  put  it  in  terms  of \ndominance). ","2505":"If  adopted,  respondents  believe  that  the  tool  should  focus  on  structural \ncompetition problems and thus be potentially applicable to all undertakings in \na market (i.e. including dominant but also non-dominant companies) as far as \nthe  criteria  mentioned  in  the  response  to  the  previous  question  or  similar \nconditions  set  to  establish  certain  distortion  of  effective  competition,  as  a \nresult of high and permanent barriers to entry and expansion, are met. ","2506":"Without  prejudice  of  the  above,  respondents  also  believe  that,  should  the \nEuropean  Commission  consider  it  necessary  to  introduce  such  a  new \ncompetition ex ante tool, it should focus on structural competition problems \nand thus be potentially applicable to all undertakings in a market (i.e. including \ndominant but also non-dominant companies). ","2507":"The  reason  why  we  propose  that  the  new  tool  should  be  applicable  to  all \ncompanies is that we understand that Article 102 of the TFEU is an effective \ntool  which  can  already  be  used  to  tackle  with  most  kind  of  structural \ncompetition problems which arise in markets where a dominant player can be \nidentified. In these situations, the investigation of possible abusive conducts \ncan  result  in  the  imposition  of  behavioural  or  structural  remedies  to  the \ndominant  player  which  help  to  redress  the  structural  problems  (such  as \naccess  to  the  market  in  fair  conditions,  lack  of  discrimination,  control  of \npotential excessive prices, control of potentially exclusionary conducts such \nas tying strategies, loyalty rebates, etc.). ","2508":"As explained above, we understand that, if the European Commission were \nto conclude that a new competition tool is to operate regardless of dominance \nbut on the basis of a vague notion of \u201cmarket power\u201d, it should still be subject \nto legally certain criteria based on distorted effective competition as a result \nof significant and permanent barriers to entry and expansion in strategically \nimportant points of access. ","2509":"It  shall  be  limited  in  scope  to  sectors\/markets  where  clear  structural \ncompetition problems are the most prevalent and\/or most likely to arise. Such \ncould be the case of, for example (but not limited to) multi-sided platforms or \necosystems where concentration is liable to stem from network effects, and, \nif these were to result in barriers to entry and expansion (which as mentioned \nabove  is  not  necessarily  always  the  case),  they  would  confer  on  certain \ncompanies gatekeeper powers to set the competitive conditions in the same \nor  an  adjacent  market.  It  is  important  to  note  that  respondents  for  not \nrecommend  a  \u201csectorial\u201d  tool (for instance,  only for digital, much  less  if  the \nparallel legislative regulation ex-ante Proposal is adopted -see Q24 above). If \nthe tool is finally implemented, it should have a horizontal character and be \napplied in general to sectors that present permanent (not transitory) and clear \nstructural  problems  that  competition  dynamics  and  other  tools  at  the \nCommission\u2019s disposal (see answer to Q.24 above) cannot solve. ","2510":"As previously indicated, we believe that Competition Law provides European \nauthorities  (administrative  and  judicial  ones)  with  effective  ex  ante  tools \n(merger control, state aid control) and ex post tools (prohibition of horizontal \nand  vertical  restrictive  agreements,  prohibition  of  abuses  of  dominant \npositions)  in  order  to  tackle  most  structural  competition  problems  arising  in \nmany  different  markets.  European  and  national  courts  of  justice  have \ndeveloped - and still do - a complete case law which ensures that these rules \nare applied with due respect of citizens and companies\u2019 rights. This results in \na  good balance  between administrative enforcement powers,  on one hand, \nand  the  principles  of  legal  certainty  and  free  economy  which  govern  our \nmarkets, on the other hand. ","2511":"A  new  competition  tool  which  would  work  ex  ante,  without  the  need  of \nidentifying  any  infringement  of  competition  rules  by  any  company,  could \nrepresent a significant limitation to free economy and free development of the \nmarkets and may also affect fundamental rights (right to property in case of \nstructural remedies, for instance). As mentioned in our response to question \n24, from the legal point of view, respondents are, in general, afraid that a new \ncompetition tool could jeopardise the delicate balance between intervention in \nthe  public  interest  and  companies\u2019  rights  and  freedoms  by  lowering  the \ndifferent standards that case law has developed for each type of infringement \naccording to its potential harm to welfare. Also the proposal would lead to a \ndivergent  approach  and  possible  interpretation  of  what  is  prohibited  or  not \nunder competition rules, distorting the consistency in the application of Arts. \n101 and 102 TFEU. From the economic point of view, type I errors could lead \nto unintended consequences in rapidly evolving markets where new business \ncould be nipped in the bud. ","2512":"This  is  why  respondents  believe  that,  should  the  European  Commission \nconsider it necessary to have such a new tool, it should have a limited scope. \nMore specifically, if finally adopted, the new competition tool should be limited \nin  scope  to  sectors\/markets  where  structural  competition  problems  are  the \nmost prevalent and\/or most likely to arise, and fulfil certain criteria based on \ndistorted  effective  competition  as  a  result  of  significant  and  permanent \nbarriers to entry and expansion in strategically important points of access. ","2513":"Although respondents do not share that starting premise, it is true that new & \nemerging markets, with new distribution channels  - such as apps, or online \nservices \u2013 have characteristics which are quite particular, including the zero \npricing,  the  relevance  of  personal  data,  strong  network  effects,  etc.  This  is \nsomething typical from services which have been digitised. Nowadays, more \nand more services are being digitised; and we believe that, if finally adopted, \nthe new competition tool should be applied in relation to any market where \ndigital and online services are provided, provided that criteria are set in order \nto ensure that significant and permanent barriers to entry and expansion in \nimportant point of access may lead to distorted effective competition.    ","2514":"This  notwithstanding,  as  indicated  in  our  response  to  question  28.1  above, \nrespondents  believe  that,  if  the  Commission  finally  decides  to  adopt  a  new \ncompetition tool, the new instrument should be subject to certain criteria along \nthe  aforementioned  lines  (related  to  significant  and  permanent  barriers  to \nentry and  expansion  in  important  point of  access), and  it  will  be  in  practice \nessentially limited to digital markets (but without ruling out the possibility for \nother markets to also fulfil these criteria). ","2515":"Respondents understand that existing sector specific legislation provides very \nimportant legal certainty to players acting in the fields which are the object of \nsuch  regulations  (telecoms,  energy,  transport,  financial  or  postal  services). \nBecause of the existence of written and objective rules, companies of any size \n(incumbent players and new entrants) acting in these strategic markets are \nperfectly aware of their rights and obligations. ","2516":"If a new competition ex ante tool were to be introduced, it would be essential \nnot to distort such legal certainty. Therefore, detailed guidance on the criteria \nof enforcement by the European or national authorities of any new competition \ntool  should  be  provided  to  companies,  especially  if  the  new  tool  allows \nauthorities to investigate behaviors where no infringements at all of the law \ncan be identified. ","2517":"As indicated in our answer to questions 24 to 26, respondents believe there \nis  no  real  need  for  a  new  competition  tool  in  order  to  effectively  face  the \nspecific problems of emerging new markets, as current Competition Law (in \nparticular Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, but also Merger Control mechanisms), \ntogether with ex ante sectorial regulation, whenever needed (as it is the case \nin  Telecoms,  Energy,  Postal,  Financial  or  Transport  markets),  have \ndemonstrated  to  be  effective  tools  in  order  to  tackle  most  restrictions  of \ncompetition,  either  unilateral  (abuses  of  unilateral  dominant  position)  or \nmultilateral  (abuses  of  collective  dominant  positions  and  restrictive \nagreements between companies).  ","2518":"Without prejudice to the above, should the European Commission consider it \nnecessary to introduce such ex ante new competition tool, we would suggest \nthat authorities have quite limited powers when using such tool. Such powers \ncould include issuing recommendations to companies, trade associations and \ngovernments on measures which would be appropriate to adopt in order to \nminimize the risk of foreclosure or distortion of competition in specific markets \nas  a  result  of  some  structural  problems.  These  recommendations  could \npropose measures to ensure fair competition between players and welfare of \nconsumers. ","2519":"By  contrast,  respondents  believe  that  the  imposition  of  structural  or \nbehavioural  remedies  to  companies  by  and  administrative  authority  should \ndefinitely not be included as part of the powers of authorities using such new \ntool,  much  less  if  i)  there  is  an  ex  ante  sector  specific  regulation  imposing \nclear  obligations \nthe  competitive \nto  companies  aimed  at  protecting \nenvironment and ii) remedies are imposed by public authorities whenever an \ninfringement of the rules (competition or the said ex-ante sectorial regulation) \nis identified, on a particular case.  ","2520":"From  the  legal  point  of  view,  the  power  to  impose  specific  remedies  to \ncompanies represents an administrative intervention which can significantly \nlimit companies\u2019 freedom of behaviour in the market. Legal certainty implies \nthe right of companies to know which are the strict and exact limits to their \nbehaviour in the market. From an economic point of view, over-enforcement \ncould disincentive new business models before they reach the point at which \nefficiencies  are  generated,  while  the  accumulation  of  market  power  can  be \ntackled  by  means  of  Competition  Law  or  regulation  at  a  later  stage  where \nharm to welfare is to manifest itself. ","2521":"As explained in our answer to question 30 and 30.1, we understand it would \nnot be reasonable nor appropriate that the European Commission might be \nable  to  impose  any  sort  of  remedies  \u2013  either  behavioral  or  structural  \u2013 \nwhenever applying a possible new ex ante competition tool, with no clear rules \nknown by companies as to the limits of their behavior in the market. We have \nhighlighted above the unintended consequences that these may bring about \nfrom both the legal and economic points of view. ","2522":"Compulsory divestment of a business is a very serious matter, which limits \nthe  development  of  economic  activity  of  any  company  in  a  free  market \neconomy, from the legal point of view, and may affect their incentives, from \nthe economic point of view. We understand that such a measure should only \nbe imposed on the basis of very clear and objective rules previously known \nby companies, e.g. in cases where a company has  incurred in very serious \ninfringement  of  competition  law  in  the  market  (e.g.  abusing  its  dominant \nposition).  The \nto  strict \nproportionality limits and is the \u201clast resort\u201d when applying Articles 101 or 102 \nTFEU. Allowing a similar intrusive measure via \u201cenforcement\u201d, not agreed with \nthe company (for instance, some recent commitment cases under Article 9 of \nRegulation  1\/2003  include  this  type  of  remedies)  and  with  no  previous \ninfringement,  would  be  unjustified  and  will  face  serious  legal  and  even \nconstitutional problems.  ","2523":"Structural remedies have also been imposed in cases where a new merger \nthreatens the maintenance of effective competition in any market. In merger \ncases, divestment remedies can either be offered to competition authorities \nby merging companies themselves \u2013 which is a legitimate decision made by \na  company  \u2013 or they can  be  imposed  by the  authorities,  in  which  case  the \ncompany has the right to decline and stop its merger project. ","2524":"Most  of  our  members  understand  that  a  competition  new  tool  which  could \nimpose structural remedies such as compulsory divestment of business to any \ncompany which has not infringed any rules would threaten the principles of \nlegal  certainty  and  free  economy  and  risk  affecting  disproportionately \neconomic  incentives  to  develop  potentially  welfare-enhancing  business \nmodels. If the Commission finally decides to include it, it should establish strict \nproportionality  tests  and  also  ensure  that  all  the  procedural  guarantees  of \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU are respected (including hearings, evidence and \njudicial review). ","2525":"Section E of the questionnaire bears the heading \u2018Institutional set-up of a new \ncompetition tool\u2019. However, none of its questions (33 to 39) seek any views \non the institutional framework that would apply this mechanism, as if it should \nbe obvious that the Commission should be the sole enforcement authority. ","2526":"The respondents to this Questionnaire would like to stress that, in their view, \nthe NCT can only be understood as an instrument for the public interest. As \nsuch, it lacks a clear definition of principles and rules, being more concerned \nwith empowering agencies than on setting limits from the outset which would \nconfine those powers to their intended aim. There is additionally little mention \nof  checks  and  balances.  It  is  expected  that  this  will  be  eventually  debated \nalong the legislative process. ","2527":"In anticipation of that debate, we would suggest that the institutional scheme \nthat would enforce the NCT should be open to the participation of Member \nStates, including national competition agencies and national authorities with \njurisdiction  on  digital  regulation  and  neighbouring  areas,  irrespective  of  the \nbalance ultimately reached between the NCT and eventual ex-ante regulation. \nTrue, this should be weighed against the efficiency of the scheme; but this is \ntoo important not to consider it carefully. ","2528":"If  there  is  to  be  a  new  competition  tool  to  be  managed  by  the  European \nCommission  (please  see  above,  answer  to  question  11,  Section  C),  there \nneed  be  rules governing  the  exercise  by  the  Commission  of  the  necessary \nenforcement powers under Article 103 TFEU. It is apparent that Regulation \n1\/2003  would  not  automatically  apply,  as  these  powers  may  not  fall  strictly \nunder  Articles  101\/102  TFEU,  which  define  its  scope,  and  therefore  a  new \nvehicle  would  be  needed.  This  new  vehicle  should  ensure  that  the  parties\u2019 \nrights  of defence  and their  right to  appeal the  decisions  are  preserved  in a \nway similar to Regulation 1\/2003, with a fair contradictory procedure, proper \ninvestigation, statement of objections\/conclusions, monitoring systems, etc. ","2529":"There are probably acceptable and questionable reasons for this. A part of \nthe  information  is  extraordinarily  sensitive.  In  other  cases,  not  even  the \nplayers themselves have a clear use for data they retain but guess it could \ndevelop into something of value. Discussing their projects is difficult from a \nPR  standpoint.  There  is  a  clear  need  for  mechanisms  to  break  those \nresistances.  ","2530":"As regards the powers to request information and to interview management \nand personnel, the respondents to this Questionnaire consider that the NCT \nshould be somehow flexible in relation in particular to the length of the time \nperiods granted for the companies to respond to RFIs. On the one hand, we \nunderstand the amount of data, not only in digital sectors\/markets may be very \nsignificant  and  difficult \nthe \nCommission\u2019s potential questions within the tight deadlines typically imposed \nby the Commission in the context of Regulation 1\/2003 and the EUMR; on the \nother  hand,  while  there  might  be  structural  competition  problems  as  the \nCommission  points  out,  the  NCT  will  not  lead  to  the  establishment  of  an \ninfringement or the imposition of fines (according to question 25 of the present \nquestionnaire) and, therefore,  this  is not  a  situation  comparable  to  those  in \nwhich the Commission sends RFIs in the context of infringement proceedings.  ","2531":"It is understood that the question refers to binding deadlines for the agencies, \nlike  those  under  Regulation  1\/2003  and  the  EUMR.  That  is  likely  to  be \ncounterproductive. The logic behind a deadline-based procedure is to return \nto  a  \u2018clearance\u2019  base  situation  soon.  If  adopted,  the  new  competition  tool \nshould rather operate as a constant monitoring of digital markets, without any \nhaste in terminating any specific procedure.  ","2532":"Respondents  are  concerned  about  the  possibility  of  imposing  interim \nmeasures  given  the  risk  that  such  measures  would  disrupt  the  companies\u2019 \nbusiness model and cause irreparable harm or at least an unjustified harm to \nentities  not  having  found  liable  of  any  infringement,  particularly  if  such \nmeasures are adopted by an authority whose powers would not be limited by \nlaw.  ","2533":"It is worth noting that despite the questionnaire using a term known in law for \nyears, these measures would be fundamentally different from the provisional, \nconservatory measures that are known and used in infringement proceedings, \nwhich require not only an imminent risk of irreparable harm, but also an initial \nfinding  of  contradiction  with  the  law  (the  so-called  fumus  boni  iuris).  In \ncontrast, the interim measures here considered would, by implication, require \nonly  a  risk  of  irreparable  harm,  as  by  definition  the  conduct  would  not  be \nillegal. This makes these initiatives quite dangerous, as the authority would \nnot  act  upon  limits  set  by  law  and  its  actions  would  constitute  a  severe \ninterference  in  the  right  of  freedom  of  enterprise,  property  and  could  also \ncause an unjustified harm to perfectly legal business models.  ","2534":"The  question,  as  formulated,  is  confusing.  The  NCT  should  indeed  make \nprovision  for a  dialogue  with  the  undertakings  operating  in  the  market  (it  is \nunclear if  the  term  \u2018companies\u2019  is used  in  that  sense).  As  in other areas  of \ncompetition  law,  commitments  should  be  preferred  to  unilaterally  imposed \nremedies. However, the reference to \u2018voluntary\u2019 is misleading in this context \n(there  is  hardly  anything  voluntary  in  receiving  an  invitation  from  an \nenforcement  authority).  Leaving \ntheir  presentation  as \n\u201ccommitments\u201d  appears  to  suggest  an  analogy  with  commitments  under \narticle  9  of  Regulation  1\/2003.  That  identification  would  be  misplaced,  as \nArticle 9 concerns a way to avoid an infringement decision, not an amendment \nto an (initially legal) commitment initiative. That fundamental distinction would \nmake  it  necessary  to  ensure  that  these  measures  are  fully  reviewable.  For \ntotal clarity \u2013 undertakings should have the right to question their \u2018voluntary\u2019 \ncommitments before the European Courts as well as have the possibility of \nadapt  such  commitments  if  the  change  of  circumstances  render  them \ndisproportionate. ","2535":"The NCT arguably needs stronger standards than when enforcing Articles 101 \nand  102  TFEU.  The  reasons  are  many:  lack  of  defined  standards,  risk  of \ninterference with economic freedoms, risk of stifling technical and economic \ndevelopment, etc. In order to minimise enforcement errors (type I or II) hearing \nall  interested  parties  in  candidness  will  be  essential,  again  arguably  even \nmore than with the classic prohibitions. ","2536":"This should result in a close examination of the necessity and proportionality \nof  any  eventual  commitments,  even  where  offered  by  market  players \nthemselves. The logic of the Alrosa case-law (essentially, that parties are free \nto propose commitments that the authority may not need to justify as adequate \nor proportionate) is understood in an infringement setting, but should not be \nfollowed in connection with the NCT: any and all remedies should be justified \nas  necessary  and  proportionate,  and  it  should  be  possible  to  seek \nconfirmation by the Courts that this is the case.  ","2537":"TUI observes that specific market players have established themselves as gatekeeper in the EU \nonline environment, by virtue of their large user bases, user lock-in and network effects (a.o.). This \nresults in these players having rulemaking powers in some markets, limiting competition, innovation \nand consumer welfare. TUI believes that while the EU\u2019s online travel and tourism market currently \noffers the many SMEs of the sector an opportunity to effectively reach customers, certain concerning \ndevelopments regarding systemic operators and gatekeeping activities can be observed.  ","2538":"In light of this, TUI underlines that only a very limited number of systemic operators should be \nregulated via the ex-ante instrument. Their status as systemic operator should be determined on the \nbasis of network effects, user lock-in and a lack of available alternatives. Factors such as revenue \nand wide geographical coverage should not be used. A wide regulation of non-systemic platforms (as \nalready pursued in the Platform-to-Business Regulation) should be avoided at all costs. ","2539":"It is our view that the Digital Services Act should set out a clear set our rules \nand frameworks for the digital (tourism)  economy for  the coming years. The \nrights and responsibilities and platforms, suppliers and users should further be \nclarified,  in  the  interest  of  maintaining  a  consumer-friendly  and  competitive \nenvironment for all actors. TUI remains committed to actively contributing to \nthe  ongoing  regulatory  debate  surrounding  the  digital  travel  and  tourism \neconomy.

TUI offers its 28 million customers integrated \nservices from a single source. Apart from the expansion of its core business with hotels, cruises and \ndestination activities, TUI is increasingly investing in digital platforms.  ","2541":"In this context, TUI welcomes the opportunity to comment on the European Commission\u2019s plans for a \nDigital Services Act package, which will define the EU\u2019s Digital Single Market for the years to come. As \nthe leading European tourism player and an established digital business, which is further expanding its \nplatform  business  model,  we  are  responding  to  this  consultation  solely  based  on  our  extensive \nexperience  and  observations  in  the  travel  &  leisure  market  and  its  connected  fields.  As  such,  all \nresponses should be considered in light of this particular market, as TUI is not giving input on issues \nnot directly related to its commercial activities. ","2542":"TUI welcomes the EU institutions\u2019 ambitions regarding regulation and enforcement in the Digital Single \nMarket. The tourism and leisure travel sectors have experienced fundamental changes as a result of \nongoing digitalisation and resulting new business models over the past decade. Much of this change \nhas been to the benefit of consumers and travelers, but also particularly the suppliers of the sectors \n(such as hotels), which are most often SMEs1. Nonetheless, the online tourism ecosystem has not been \ncompletely immune to the challenges of the wider digital economy regarding platform competition and \nabusive practices. It has become evident that a reconsideration of EU policy approaches to platform \ncompetition and the wider digital ecosystem is necessary.  ","2543":"TUI agrees with the prevailing view among digital economy stakeholders that the eCommerce Directive \n(eCD) and its fundamental principles have been crucial to the successful development of  the EU\u2019s \nDigital Single Market and should not be challenged as such. The safe harbor principle and the concept \nof the ban on general monitoring obligations should thus be safeguarded in the revision of the eCD as \npart of the Digital Services Act.  ","2544":"1 Ecorys, EASME, Study on the Contribution of Tourism to Local and Regional Development \u2013 Evidence from the \nEuropean Structural and Investment Funds 2012-2018 (2020) \n2 Directive 2000\/31\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of \ninformation society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market ","2545":"In this context, the stipulations of Recital 42 of the eCD and its resulting legal interpretations should \nbe  reconsidered.  Specifically,  the  binary  distinction  between  passive  and  active  hosts  should  be \nreplaced with a more precise and gradual classification, based on the actual degree of knowledge and \ncontrol of third party content. Here, TUI particularly argues for the possibility of retaining the liability \nexemption, while holding limited control over content, e.g. through basic editorial powers (supervision \nthe  form  of  description  text,  but  not  the  included  information).  The  concept  of  knowledge  of \nfalsehoods or illegality of the content is key, in our view. Conversely, a differentiation among different \ntypes of hosting providers should be approached cautiously, although an exclusion of hosting provider \ndirectly involved in the handling and provision of third party services\/goods (such as large E-Commerce \nmarket places for goods) from the liability exemption may be beneficial.  ","2546":"An aspect to be carefully analyzed is the capacity of platforms of various sizes to adhere to the same \nrules. As  with  competition  of and on platforms under  the potential ex-ante  instrument,  it  may be \nworthwhile to contemplate a distinction of the degree of (legal) platform responsibility, based on very \nlarge  (systemic)  platforms\u2019  ability  to  adhere  to  strict  regulations  with  relative  ease,  while  smaller \ncompetitors may struggle significantly.  ","2547":"Regarding  an  potential  expansion  of  due  diligence  and  transparency  requirements  for  platform \noperators  in  the  context  of  the  Digital  Services  Act,  TUI  underlines  the  importance  of  avoiding \noverburdening administrative costs. In this respect, an asymmetric approach as outlined above may \nbe suitable to avoid a consolidation of the market power of  very large digital businesses, based on \ntheir ability  to more easily  comply  with  regulatory  requirements  than smaller operators or market \nentrants.   ","2548":"Our extensive experience tells us that in the EU online environment, certain players hold significant \nmarket power and may be judged to be performing a gatekeeping role also in the tourism sector, \nspecifically in tourism advertising and marketing. Here, we see that even larger online operators in the \ntourism sector have developed a dependence on a very limited number of platforms in terms of their \ntraffic in general, whether organic or paid (which is clearly reflected in their marketing and advertising \nspending).  ","2549":"As such,  we are  witnessing  that  the  current  state  of  the  online  travel  advertising and  distribution \nmarket  is  characterized  by  strong  systemic  actors,  who  act  as  bottlenecks  for  all  economic \noperators  wishing  to  offer  tourism  services  online.  These  systemic  actors  oversee  entire \nintegrated platform ecosystems, which do not only operate in adjacent, but also completely unrelated \nmarkets.  ","2550":" \n \n \n \n \n\fIn its most extreme form, we can observe how Google is able to leverage its search engine, consumer \nreview channels, social media and app store to significantly strengthen its position as an unavoidable \npartner for online travel advertising and distribution. Returning to the concept of bottlenecks, we \nobserve that most customers begin their holiday booking process on Google\u2019s search engine. Google\u2019s \nextremely strong position in the search engine and consumer reviews channels (a.o.) thus enables it \nto control the beginning of many booking processes, making an advertising\/marketing relationship with \nGoogle not only vital, but indeed completely unavoidable for many online tourism operators. ","2551":"The situation regarding the online travel and tourism market itself may be much less clear-cut, as some \nresearch  points  to  a  relatively  competitive  landscape,  in  which  consumers  use  a  wide  variety  of \nplatforms before making a booking decision. 3 Nonetheless, some may consider that certain large travel \nplatforms are beginning  to exhibit  certain  characteristics  of systemic actors.  The situation  of  the \nonline travel and tourism market should be closely appraised and considered in the drafting of \nthe ex-ante regulatory instrument.  ","2552":"-  Significant barriers to entry: As identified in the Commission\u2019s tender for a support study \non platforms with significant network effects acting as gatekeeper, parts of the digital economy \nare  characterized  by  an  accumulation  of  a  critical  amount  of  users  and  data  by  certain \noperators.4 TUI considers this to be one of the defining characteristic of systemic actors, which \nrender market entry  or scale-up of  competitors extremely  difficult,  by  virtue of  their large \ncompetitive advantage. This competitive advantage is a result of systemic actors\u2019 economies \nof  scale,  with  their  cost  per  user  often  approaching  zero,  and  their  economies  of  scope, \nenabling them to gain efficiencies from offering several unrelated services.5 In the context of \nsuch market dynamics, data accumulation is a relevant element to take into account.  ","2553":"-  Market power: Another key feature of systemic actors is, in line with the above description \nof economies of scope, their ability to leverage their market power in a specific market (e.g. \nsearch engines) into adjacent  or even unrelated markets  (e.g.  transportation meta-search). \nSuch leveraging of market power interplays with other gatekeeper characteristics use  their \nsignificant data advantages over competitors and exclusionary practices to disrupt competition.

In the online travel and tourism market, multi-homing of \nbusiness  users  is  a  particularly  crucial  element,  as  it  enables  customers  and  businesses  to \naccess a wide range of demand of supply and ensures increased independence from specific \nbooking platforms.  ","2557":"-  Accumulation of data: travel and accommodation platforms accumulate a significant amount \nof data and information on their customers. This data is highly valuable to all operators, as it \nserves to improve the services on offer (e.g. through targeted recommendations and the ability \nto provide the right information at the right time). In line with European and national data \nprotection legislation, TUI also follows this approach by using collected data to significantly \nimprove  a  range  of  services.  As  nearly  all  online  travel  and  tourism  platforms  accumulate \nsignificant data, it is spread among a range of operators small and large in size. It would be \ncounterproductive and incorrect to define such data collection as a criterion for a gatekeeping \nrole.  ","2558":"-  Share of market revenue: the market revenue created and impact on a particular sector may \nbe  a  relevant  tool  to  determine  gatekeeper  status,  but  needs  much  clearer  delineation. \nRemedies  for  abusive  practices  in  the  context  of  market  dominant  positions  are  already \ncovered in EU competition law and should not simply be duplicated here. The issue of market \ndefinition is also of significance, as already existing issues in defining digital markets should \nnot be carried over to the ex-ante tool. Depending on the market definition, medium-sized \nplatforms could be defined as systemic and thus overburdened with regulation. The approach \nto market definition should thus be cautious and trend towards a broad definition.   ","2559":"-  Size  of  organisation:  we  deem  factors  related solely  to  the  size  of an  organisation  to  be \ncompletely inappropriate to determine whether an economic actor can be characterized as \nsystemic. Considering the annual revenue generated may completely distort the image of the \nrole of a particular operator, as these factors are often the result of unrelated (e.g. offline) \nactivities.  In  general,  a  gatekeeper  cannot  simply  be  defined  by  its  size,  but  rather  by  its \npredominant influence over a significant share of users and the digital economy. ","2560":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAs with dominant companies under competition policy, an examination of the practices and abuses of \nsystemic actors in the digital economy is necessary.  The main concerning practices related  to data \nusage and sharing surround established strategies by systemic operators to effect consumer lock-in \nand strengthen their network effects in an effort to significantly raise barriers of entry to any \nmarket and thus cement their dominant and gatekeeping position.  ","2561":"An operator such as Google has succeeded in attracting a large number of single-homing users, also \nspecifically  relating  to  the  travel  and  tourism  market.  Here,  the  dominance  of  Google\u2019s  search \nengine is leveraged and incentivises users to utilise other Google services, including price comparison \nengines and customer review services, also through joint data usage and an effective integration of a \nvariety of platform services.7 As a result of these practices, users often find themselves confronted \nwith  significant  switching  costs  when  contemplating  a  multi-homing  approach  (e.g.  a  different \nsearch engine does not have the necessary data to make highly customized recommendations)8. These \neffects thus do not only affect competition in the single market (i.e. among search engines), but give \nan operator such as Google the necessary data advantage to aggressively enter an adjacent market, \nthus potentially also tipping it in its favour to the detriment of consumer choice and innovation. TUI \nobserves that such a scenario is possible for the online travel and tourism market, in which the current \nrange of metasearch engines and booking platforms may be pushed aside by an operator with such a \nsignificant single-homing user base, network effects and data advantage.  ","2562":"TUI is generally of the view that the online travel and tourism market should be closely monitored \nregarding the practices outlined above and the influence of systemic actors. Specific concerning trends \nare  already  observable,  which  may  pose  a  risk  to  future  competition  in  this  particular  market. \nSpecifically, certain corporates active in the online travel markets operate multiple metasearch \nand booking platforms under a single umbrella and may be able to leverage an integration of \nthese platforms to their benefit, thus reducing competition and establishing significant network effects. \nIn  this  case,  such  travel  platform  ecosystems  could  result  in  harmful  practices,  such  as  self-\npreferencing of associated platforms. As already observed by the Commission in the Google Search \n(Shopping)  case9,  there  is  a  clear  incentive  for  gatekeeper  to  give  their  services  favourable \nranking and display within search engines, to secure users\u2019 attention and clicks. These practices could \nalso be pursued by newly arising gatekeepers in the online travel and tourism market, meaning users \nwould experience similar lock-ins and switching costs as is currently the case for Google, due to the \npossible integration and joint usage of customer data. In this context, TUI highlights the need for the \nresponsible  authorities  to  closely  monitor  market  developments,  in  light  of  the  introduction  of  a \npossible ex-ante instrument.

Further, a competitive market offers customers and suppliers the opportunity \nto switch to other platforms, should they be dissatisfied with their current provider\u2019s business model. \nA general prohibition of self-preferencing should thus be strictly avoided, as it would impede \nthe further digitalisation of the tourism sector by removing sensible incentives. ","2565":"-  Limitations  on  self-preferencing  and  differentiated  treatment:  it  is  clear  that  self-\npreferencing of vertically integrated platforms can be a significant issue. While this topic has \nnot yet reached the core of TUI\u2019s business, it is evident that many players in the online travel \nand  tourism  market  are  already  heavily  affected  and  the  situation  is  likely  to  worsen,  as \nsystemic operators extend their reach. A worrying example of this are the practices outlined \nin  the  complaint  lodged  with  Executive-Vice  President  Vestager  by  vacation  rental \nintermediation services in  February  2020.12  Additionally, such practices could pose an even \nmore significant  challenge  for  the  online  travel and  tourism  market,  as  established  market \nplayers will further seek integration of their booking and metasearch services. Thus, it is crucial \nthat a prohibition of intra-platform self-preferencing is considered as a regulatory tool to limit \nthe influence of gatekeeper. Nonetheless, TUI is strictly opposed to a wider prohibition of self-\npreferencing  practices  by  non-systemic  platforms,  as  these  offer  important  benefits  and \nincentives for the crucial digital transition of the tourism sector.

This would mean that an operator overseeing a platform ecosystem \nwould be obliged to instate a data silo structure, thus prohibiting the usage of specific datasets \nfor certain business purposes.  ","2570":"-  Data portability obligation: as much of the gatekeeper\u2019 power revolves around and derives \nfrom user data, a data portability  obligation would be a  constructive  regulatory  tool. More \nspecifically, an  obligation  to  reduce  user  lock-in  via  API solutions,  would  enable  travel and \ntourism consumers to easily and safely port their data to other platforms, in line with EU data \nprotection  legislation.  Such  an  obligation  for  systemic  platforms  would  reduce  the  risk  of \nlocking in users by lowering switching costs and thus also lowering barriers of entry for new \nmarket entrants.  ","2571":"-  Data access obligation: the Commission should further seek to address the issue of systemic \noperators  leveraging a  dominant  position  in  one  market  to strengthen  their  position  in an \nadjacent  or  even  non-related  market,  by  using  the  significant  data  advantages  they  have \naccrued elsewhere. The economies of scale and scope involved are so large for these systemic \noperators that real competition can no longer occur in some instances and a regulatory remedy \n(beyond  EU  competition  law)  has  become  necessary  to  ensure  a  functioning  market  for \nconsumers and competitors. This problem may be addressed via obligatory data access for \ngatekeeper\u2019 competitors and users. As laid out in Executive Vice-President Vestager\u2019s Special \nAdvisers\u2019 Report: \u201cIn order to enable formerly disadvantaged competitors to regain strength, \nit may (\u2026) be necessary to give them access to the dominant platform\u2019s competitively relevant \ndata  resources\u201d14.  For  the  travel  and  tourism  sector  specifically,  such  data  should  be \ncommercially  relevant  to  act  as  a  remedy  (e.g.  data  related  to  search  terms,  consumer \npreference and the supply of touristic services). For tourism business users already partnering \nwith systemic operators (e.g. in marketing), the possibility to export relevant datasets (incl. \npost-click and post-view data on paid advertisements) and allow for aggregation with third-\nparty data would be particularly useful, as this could allow a more accurate analysis of user \nbooking journeys, to name an example.

As such, not all available options should be applied in all cases. Platforms should \nbe able to provide a proper justification for their practices, which must be reviewed fairly in light of \ntheir impact on consumers, suppliers and other (business) customers before any decisions are taken \nregarding their status as gatekeeper. After decisions have been taken, full judicial review must also be \navailable, in line with the application of EU competition law. Additionally, a periodical review of the \ngatekeeper designation and imposition of remedies must be mandatory.  ","2573":"Consequently, TUI does support case-by-case remedies, although these should be based on a pre-\ndefined list of prohibitions and obligations, attached to a suitable regulatory procedure. We do not \nsupport  regulatory  intervention  with  remedies  which  have  not  been  specified  by  the  European \nlegislator.  Following  this  approach,  regulators,  potential  gatekeeper  companies,  competitors  and \nconsumers would have a reasonable degree of certainty regarding how the ex-ante regulation may \naffect  their  business  and  activities  in  the  digital  economy.  While  we  do  understand  the  desire  to \nimplement highly targeted remedies for individual systemic operators, the procedure outlined above \nstrikes a positive balance between individualised remedies and certainty for all involved actors. ","2574":"Considering the nature of systemic operators in the European digital economy and the potential ex-\nante  instrument\u2019s  close  interaction  with  conventional  EU  competition  policy,  as  well  as  the  New \nCompetition  Tool  (NCT),  TUI  is  of  the  view  that  enforcement  must  be  handled  by  a  single \nauthority. In the interest of avoiding incoherent national enforcement and a resulting fragmentation \nof the Digital Single Market, DG Competition of the European Commission should be entrusted \nto enforce the novel rules under the ex-ante instrument. This approach would ensure a coherent \napplication of the rules in the Digital Single Market, while also contributing to a coherent interpretation \nand interplay between applicable competition rules and the ex-ante instrument.  ","2575":"An additional point of consideration is the overlap between the ex-ante instrument and the New \nCompetition Tool. We see an imminent danger of significant overlap between these two instruments \nin  the  regulation  of  large  platforms,  which  could  create  legal  uncertainty  and  an  incoherence  in \napplication. The Commission must very clearly define how the ex-ante regulatory framework and the \nNew  Competition  Tool  will  interact  and  how  overlap  can  be  avoided.  In  this  context,  TUI  would \nsupport a stronger and more clearly defined role for the ex-ante instrument, which could be \ncomplemented  by  additional  market  investigation  powers  under  the  New  Competition  Tool \n(without the possibility to impose case-by-case remedies). In our view, the more distinct and clearly \ndefined scope of the ex-ante instrument, focusing entirely on systemic operators, leads it to be \nmore appropriate for the imposition of remedies in the interest of safeguarding competition in \nthe Single Market.  ","2576":" \n \n \n \n \n\fAs such, we believe that the New Competition Tool should serve as a market inquiry instrument, which \nenables the regulator to gather information through requests, inspections and expert consultations. \nSuch  activity  should  support  and  complement  the  imposition  of  remedies  under  the  ex-ante \ninstrument. The NCT should not allow for the imposition of remedies on market operators, whether \nstructural, non-structural or of hybrid nature.  ","2577":"This approach  to  the  NCT  would ensure a proper  function and  the  creation of  synergies between \nordinary  competition policy  (focused  on dominant  operators),  the ex-ante instrument  (focused  on \nnon-dominant operators in the traditional sense) and the NCT itself (focused on market inquiry), thus \navoiding duplication and creating legal clarity, while further reinforcing regulators\u2019 ability to ensure a \ncompetitive Single Market.  ","2578":"TUI is strongly opposed  to  the  idea of revising  the P2BR as a method  to implement ex-ante \nregulatory tools for two reasons. Firstly, the P2BR has not been in force long enough to justify any \nrevision. While the Commission states that \u201cthis revision of the Platform-to-Business Regulation would \nnot  seek  to  review  the  current  provisions\u201d,  any  alteration  of  the  Regulation  before  it  has  been \nevaluated  or  even  applied  for  a  significant  amount  of  time  would  be  counterproductive  and \ninconsistent with the principle of evidence-based policymaking. Secondly, the P2BR was devised as a \nhorizontal regulatory instrument, providing for applicable rules and guidelines for all platforms in the \nDigital  Single  Market  and  thus  creating  a  solid  foundation  for  further  regulation.  This  stands  in \nfundamental opposition to the targeted nature of the possible ex-ante instrument, which would only \naffect  a  very  limited  number  of systemic  operators.  As such,  the  P2BR  and  ex-ante  instrument \nshould be complementary and tackled in separate legal acts, rather than being integrated in a single \nrevision. ","2579":"TUI is not fundamentally opposed to the measures outlined under this option, although this policy \napproach  would  clearly be lacking in ambition and  coherence. Such a lack of ambition  to properly \nregulate  the  worrying  practices  of  systemic  actors  in  the  digital  economy,  by  expanding  only \ntransparency requirements and investigative powers of regulatory authorities, would not be sufficient \nto  address  the  problems  identified  in  the  Commission\u2019s  Inception  Impact  Assessment.  A  lack  of \ncoherence would be the result of the lack of clarity on how this policy approach would interact with \nexisting  and  envisaged  investigative  powers  under  current  competition  policy  and  the  New \nCompetition Tool.   ","2580":"TUI is of the view that policy option 3 details the most comprehensive and matured policy approach \npresented in the IIA. We are generally positive towards this option, but underscore once more the \nneed to define the scope of Regulation in a very limited manner. The respective criteria and scope \nshould be established in close consideration of our comments above.  ","2581":"We can support option 3b in parts. It is evident that the concept of a \u2018whitelist\u2019 next to a prohibition \nof practices is necessary, in line with our comments on suggested obligations for systemic actors above. \nNonetheless, these should be pre-defined in a detailed manner by the European legislator, so as to \ngive consumers, suppliers and other online operators a clear and predictable legal framework.  ","2582":"Policy option 2 identified in the relevant Inception Impact Assessment is most aligned with TUI\u2019s view \non the necessary legal changes. Specifically, we support the ambition revise the liability framework for \nplatforms,  in  line  with  our  comments  above.  We  would  like  to  highlight  that  the  approach  to \ntransparency, reporting and auditing of algorithmic systems should be risk-based, focusing on the most \nproblematic moderation and recommender systems. As such, common systems in use across many \nonline  marketplaces  should  not  be  the  subject  of  such  regulatory  scrutiny.  TUI  fully  supports \nasymmetric obligations based on the type, size and risk of the digital service in question.  ","2583":"Option 2 refers to a situation of anti-competitive monopolisation in which a dominant undertaking uses its position to put its competitors at a disadvantage unfairly; in other words, a situation in which it abuses its position as a dominant undertaking on a market.  Should this be the case, this undertaking will have breached Article 102 TFEU and should, therefore, face Competition law infringement proceedings.","2584":"It is neither illegitimate nor nefarious for an undertaking - especially one which is not dominant - with market power in a core market to want to expand this power in other. Considering such behaviour as inherently suspicious goes against the core values of a Union based on principle of a free market.","2585":"An alignment in prices that is the result of the use a digital tool is not in itself anticompetitive, short of demonstrating that this alignment is the result of a coordinated and cooperative behaviour. The Court of Justice has yet to accept that mere parallel behaviour with no element of concertation could be held as anticompetitive, and that a producer is free to charge his prices, taking into account in so doing the present or foreseeable conduct of his competitors (Case 48\/69 ICI v Commission). The criteria of coordination and cooperation do not deprive economic operators of a right to adapt intelligently to the existing and anticipated conduct of their competitors (C-89\/85 Woodpulp).","2586":"Situations where customers predominantly use one service provider are not inherently problematic, especially when these are the result of conscious choice by the end-users on the market. This is also the case for tipping markets. Situations in which a market tips are not necessarily problematic and may be due to the inherent or comparative superiority of the product or service which an undertaking has placed on the market. They may therefore result from a perfectly legitimate competitive behaviour. Preventing a market from tipping thus may not be the preferable solution nor, conversely, may it even always be possible.","2587":"In any case, once a market has, in fact, tipped, and a small number of undertaking, or even a single undertaking, finds itself in a dominant position on this market, any abuse of the dominant position that this or these undertaking(s) have acquired can be tackled under article 102 TFEU.","2588":"As explained above, it is neither illegitimate nor nefarious for an undertaking - especially one which is not dominant - with market power in a core market to want to expand this power in other. Considering such behaviour as inherently suspicious goes against the core values of a Union based on principle of a free market. Therefore, it is only when the repeated strategies by a company with a market power to extend their market position infringe on Competition law that a Competition authority should be empowered to intervene.The Commission is already able to intervene in situations where competition problems arise. Article 17 of Regulation 1\/2003 empowers the Commission to conduct general inquiries into a sector of the economy, require information from undertakings operating in this sector and carry out inspections. It may also request National Competition Authorities to carry out investigations. Within this context, the Commission is already empowered to impose fines and penalties to ensure that all relevant undertakings cooperate and comply with the proceedings.","2589":"Competition authorities should be, and already are, entitled to intervene in situations in which structural competition problems are born from the anti-competitive monopolisation strategies of undertakings, as long as this undertaking is in a dominant position, under article 102. The purpose of competition law in this situation is to constrain the behaviour of undertakings which are not sufficiently restrained by other competitors by prohibiting it from abusing the position that its market power gives it. ","2590":"In cases in which an undertaking is a not in a dominant position, is it assumed and expected in a market economy that an undertaking will be limited in adopting and imposing unilateral practices by the active competition which exists on a market. Furthermore, striving to increase one's market presence is an integral part of a free market economy, in which companies are expected to actively compete against one another to increase their market share. The alternative, a market on which competitors are satisfied with their respective market share and do not seek to increase their economic efficiency, leads to a market where there is no effective competition, little innovation, and is thus of little benefit to consumer welfare. ","2591":"The Commission is thus empowered to intervene in situations where structural competition problems arise due to anti-competitive monopolisation strategies of dominant undertakings, under the provisions of Article 102 TFEU. The provisions of this article are sufficient to address any misuse of such strategies and the Commission should intervene when, and only when, an undertaking is found in breach of these provisions.Article 102 applies only to the conduct of undertakings which are already dominant. It does not apply to the conduct by which an undertaking achieves dominance, even where this conduct could be deemed anti-competitive, nor does it apply to unilateral conduct by non-dominant undertakings, even where this conduct could potentially cause harm to consumers.","2592":"It may be argued that this situation creates an \"enforcement gap\", insofar as \"monopolisation\", that is to say that the means by which an undertaking acquires its dominant or monopolistic position, is out of the scope of EU Competition Law. From the onset, it should be noted that such a blanket statement is not entirely accurate. Monopolisation strategies may be caught under article 102 where an undertaking in a dominant position abuses its position to continue increase its market power in order to achieve monopolisation. Similarly, even where this undertaking not deemed dominant, should it collude with other market operators as mean by which to increase its market share, it could similarly face infringement proceedings, under Article 101. Therefore, Competition law enforcement agencies are not entirely powerless to prevent anti-competitive monopolisation.","2593":"In any case, if the \"gap\" referred to above may indeed exist, it does because of the way the provisions of Article 102 were drafted. Thus, it is a substantial gap, not a procedural one. Should the Commission believe that this gap is the source of structural competition problems which need to be addressed, it is submitted that the only appropriate way to do so would be to amend the provisions of Article 102, or to add additional prohibitions under European Competition law. In any case, this could only be achieved through a revision of the TFEU.","2594":"The Commission cites Article 103 TFEU as a basis for this New Tool in its Inception Impact Assessment. However, this article enables the Commission to propose legislation to \u201cgive effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102\u201d, \"ensure compliance with the prohibitions\" or \" define the scope of the provisions\". It thus follows that any legislation based on Article 103 would have to be consistent with the provisions of Article 101 and 102 and would therefore not be able to prohibit behaviours or conducts which are not already prohibited under Article 102, including anti-competitive monopolisation strategies by non-dominant undertakings.","2595":"European Competition law currently prohibits collusion between competitors on a market which has the object or effect of distorting competition. The term \"agreement\" as provided under Article 101(1) TFEU  has been given a liberal construction, but has been expressed broadly by the Court of Justice as \"a concurrence of wills\" between competitors (Bayer AG v. Commission). Article 101(1) further applies, even where no formal agreement can be established, when they have taken part in concerted practices.","2596":"In any case, EU Competition law has been interpreted as targeting \"explicit\" collusion. It thus requires reciprocal cooperation between undertakings, some form of wilful and intentional cooperation, that is to say \"a meeting of the minds\" (T-587\/08 Del Monte) or a joint intention to conduct themselves in a specific way, through direct or indirect contact (C-286\/13 Dole Food). As explained in an earlier answer, the Court of Justice has yet to accept that mere parallel behaviour with no element of concertation could be held as anticompetitive and has held that the criteria of coordination and cooperation do not deprive economic operators of a right to adapt intelligently to the existing and anticipated conduct of their competitors (C-89\/85 Woodpulp).","2597":"Furthermore, even in cases where the existence of an agreement pursuant to Article 101(1) has been established, this agreement may not be held as anti-competitive should it fulfil the four criteria provided under Article 101(3). Therefore, even in cases where an actual collusion has been demonstrated, the intervention of a competition authority is not automatically justified. Such leniency should also apply where no explicit collusion was established between competitors. ","2598":"The NCT appears to simply do away with the requirements and the burden of proof imposed on Competition Authorities under the TFEU. The possibility for a competition authority to intervene where no agreement was reached or concerted practice has taken place between competitors, i.e. where no explicit collusion between competitors was established, represents a dramatic departure from established precedent and goes beyond the scope of Article 101.","2599":"This proposal would create a substantial and unfair burden for companies as it would lead to situations where undertakings would be held accountable despite the absence of an active collusion on their part but have simply reacted to their competitors' behaviour. The burden of proof imposed on the Commission by the Treaties would be lowered to such a extent that it would give a competition authority virtually unchecked powers to impose structural and behavioural remedies on undertakings the conduct of which would otherwise never have triggered enforcement proceedings.","2600":"Article 101(1) is aimed at explicit collusion, whether occurring through a formal agreement or more informal collusion. The term \"concerted practices\" aims to forestall the possibility for undertakings evading the application of Article 101 by colluding in a manner which would fall short of the definition of an actual agreement. ","2601":"Nevertheless, the Court of Justice has made it clear that parallel conduct or tacit collusion is not in itself prohibited by Article 101(1) (C 40\/73 Suiker Unie; C 172\/80 Zuchner). The Court of Justice has indeed stressed that Article 101(1) did not prevent an undertaking from adapting its behaviour intelligently to the existing or anticipated conduct of competitors. Nevertheless, the Court has held that parallel conduct may provide evidence of concertation where it constitutes the only plausible explanation for such conduct. ","2602":"As explained in a previous answer, an alignment in prices that is the result of the use a digital tool is not in itself anticompetitive, short of demonstrating that this alignment is the result of a coordinated and cooperative behaviour. The Court of Justice has yet to accept that mere parallel behaviour with no element of concertation could be held as anticompetitive, and that a producer is free to charge his prices, taking into account in so doing the present or foreseeable conduct of his competitors (Case 48\/69 ICI v Commission). The criteria of coordination and cooperation do not deprive economic operators of a right to adapt intelligently to the existing and anticipated conduct of their competitors (C-89\/85 Woodpulp). ","2603":"The use of pricing algorithms is a modern tool by which companies can adapt and anticipate the conduct of their competitors. While in the past, companies would have had to monitor the market themselves to assess their competitors' behaviour and adapt to it, this practice can now be carried out more intelligently and efficiently through such algorithms. Nevertheless, the practice remains the same, and Court of Justice's rulings on this issue should continue to apply.  ","2604":"Dynamic algorithmic pricing is efficient and clearly yields a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the more companies adopt pricing algorithms and the more sellers post their current prices, the more market data becomes accessible and market transparency increases. While this may be viewed as a breeding ground for so called \"tacit collusion\", it should also be born in mind that market transparency is generally said to benefit consumers. ","2605":"While there may be, theoretically, a point at which a market becomes so transparent that it runs the risk of tipping into all-out tacit collusion, it is questionable whether a competition authority could accurately pinpoint the exact point at which this market will tip. On the other hand, prohibiting the use of such algorithmic pricing tools too early, or worse yet, on principle, will deprive consumers of the benefit of the transparency which these tools bring to the market.","2606":"In any case, art. 101 TFEU is the right tool to address cases in which pricing algorithms have been misused. Any attempt to intervene without the boundaries laid down in the the provisions of Article 101 TFEU would restrict companies' ability to exercise their legitimate rights.Whilst real-time monitoring of competitor prices and dynamic algorithmic pricing might have an anticompetitive effect, absent evidence of any form of agreement or explicit collusion among competitors, competition authorities lack the legal basis for intervention. The concept of a concerted practice, as defined by the Court of Justice, demands reciprocal cooperation, through direct or indirect contact, designed to influence the conduct of an actual or potential competitor or to disclose to them the course of conduct that will or maybe adopted on the market (C-89\/85 Woodpulp).","2607":"However, the issue here is not whether Article 101 is suitable and sufficiently effective instrument to target pricing algorithm. The issue is whether it should. As already explained, economic operators have a right to adapt intelligently to the existing and anticipated conduct of their competitors, which these tools allow them to do. Article 101 is not meant to deprive them from this ability. Furthermore, as explained above, algorithmic pricing tools increase the transparency of the market, which benefits consumers. Prohibiting the use of these tools would therefore be detrimental to consumer welfare.","2608":"Some competition law experts have argued that over-reliance on algorithmic pricing tools can lead to scenarios in which a market becomes so transparent that undertakings are able to adjust their prices too quickly for there to be any benefit to consumers (e.g. because the incentive to offer discounts has disappeared), or settle on a sustainable price which is higher than that which would exist under competitive market conditions, which would be detrimental to consumer welfare. To date, such scenarios remain theoretical; they rely on experimental data and have, so far, no basis in fact. They should therefore not be viewed as convincing grounds to define policy, let alone to justify ex-ante intervention by competition authorities.","2609":"As explained in an earlier answer, situations in which a market tips are not necessarily problematic and may be due to the inherent or comparative superiority of the product or service which an undertaking has placed on the market. They may therefore be the consequence of a perfectly legitimate and efficient competitive behaviour and the resulting choice from end-user. Preventing a market from tipping thus may not always be the preferable solution nor, conversely, may it even always be possible.","2610":"In such cases, it is essential to focus on consumers' interest and welfare. Artificially preventing a market from tipping from a purely structural approach, on principle, is economically questionable as it ignores market dynamics and the core reasons for which a market is tipping. In some cases, such practices may ultimately be detrimental to consumer welfare.As explained above, preventing a market from tipping may not always be necessary, or indeed preferable. However, when a market tips due the anticompetitive behaviour of one or several undertakings, it may indeed be necessary to react. To that end, this or these undertakings' anticompetitive behaviour should be brought to an end, which can be done efficiently bringing infringement proceedings against and imposing appropriate remedies on these undertakings, on the basis of the provisions of Articles 101 or 102 or a combination of these.","2611":"The Commission is already able to intervene when an undertaking is in a dominant position on a specific market because it acts as a gatekeeper. Should the undertaking abuse this dominant position under the provisions of article 102 TFEU, the Commission is empowered to bring infringement proceedings against it, impose fines and order structural and\/or behavioural to put an end to the infringement. ","2612":"Under the Treaty provisions, the market power of a given undertaking does not in itself warrant intervention for the Competition Authority. Its status, being that of a dominant operator, a so called \"gatekeeper\" or even that of a monopoly, is not inherently at fault. Rather, it is the actions of this undertaking which may come to question and may justify intervention if it exploits its position to distort competition. ","2613":"This New Competition Tool would change the rules laid down in the Treaty and the standards against which undertakings are assessed. No more would the actions of an undertaking be called into questions, but rather its status itself. This very status would be viewed as inherently problematic, as the cause of competition problems which would justify intervention by a competition authority, despite the fact that this undertaking never actively behaved in an anticompetitive manner.","2614":"It could be argued that this reasoning could have a detrimental effect on competition and be a deterrent to innovation. For what would be the incentive for undertakings to compete and innovate to increase their market share, knowing that, should they succeed, the position they will have acquired will trigger a market intervention, their gains be subject to heavy remedies, their assets be liquidated, their very structure be called into question and their business model be adapted to support rivals who may be less efficient or less innovative? All of this, it appears, on principle, and regardless of their continued efforts to fully comply with the law?As explained above, the Commission is already able to intervene when an undertaking is in a dominant position on a specific market due to the fact that it acts as a gatekeeper. Should the undertaking abuse this dominant position under the provisions of article 102 TFEU, the Commission is empowered to bring infringement proceedings against it, impose fines and order structural and\/or behavioural to put an end to the infringement.","2615":"With regard to the specific case of as so-called \"gatekeeper\" controlling access to a specific input, Article 102 TFEU provides the means by which to address situations in which an undertaking is prevented by this gatekeeper from accessing the input which it needs to carry out its activity. A particular type of abuse prohibited under Article 102 might arise when a dominant undertaking refuses to supply an input or license an intellectual property right (i.e. refuses to deal), which is essential in order to compete on a downstream market. In such cases, Competition law provisions conflict with Intellectual Property rights.  In such cases, a duty to deal may be mandated by competition law. Nevertheless, the protection of IP rights is crucial for innovation. Therefore such situations must remain exceptional and the threshold for intervention is and should remain typically high. ","2616":"This situation is not without justification; undertakings may acquire market power by establishing an infrastructure that renders them uniquely suited to serve their customers. Compelling such firms to share the source of their advantage is in some tension with the underlying purpose of competition law, since it may lessen the incentive for undertakings to invest and innovate, which would ultimately be harmful to dynamic efficiency and consumer welfare. It is also at odds with deep-seated principles of freedom of contract and property, which hold that one should be free to contract with whomever one choses, and to dispose of one's property freely. Enforced sharing also requires competition authorities to act as central planners, identifying the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing, which is a role for which they are ill-suited. Moreover, compelling negotiation between competitors may facilitate the supreme evil of competition law: collusion. For these reasons, while refusing to deal, and thus limiting access to some input, may in some cases be deemed anticompetitive, it is typically an exceptional situation, and should remain so.","2617":"As stated in an earlier answer, European Competition law prohibits collusion between competitors on a market which has the object or effect of distorting competition. The term \"agreement\" as provided under Article 101(1) TFEU has been given a liberal construction and has been expressed broadly by the Court of Justice as \"a concurrence of wills\" between competitors (Bayer AG v. Commission). This definition is broad enough to encompass any agreement between undertakings that would have the object or effect of distorting competition.","2618":"However, Article 101 also allows Competition Authorities to bring infringement proceedings against parties that have resorted to more informal collusion. Article 101(1) further applies, even where no formal agreement can be established, when undertakings have taken part in concerted practices. This notion of concerted practices has similarly been given a broad definition, as it is held to be \"any direct or indirect contact between [...] operators, the object or effect whereof is either to influence the conduct on the market of an actual or potential competitor or to disclose to such a competitor the course of conduct which they themselves have decided to adopt or contemplate adopting on the market\" (Suiker Unie). ","2619":"These definitions, and the European Courts' interpretation of these practices, appear broad enough to capture any explicit anti-competitive collusion between undertakings.Not applicableThe prohibition laid down in Article 102 is born from the idea that, where market power, or even monopoly, is the result of an undertaking's success on the market, it is legitimate, and there is no justification in punish it. It is recognised that market power, even where it gives rise to a \"dominant position\" in the market, should not be deemed illegal per se, as long as it is acquired by lawful means. Nevertheless, to ensure that competition is preserved dominance should not be abused in ways that are detrimental to the structure of a market and thus on the choices of consumers. In order to protect the process of competition as rivalry therefore, the unilateral conduct of dominant firms which would lead to further concentration, either through merger or through exclusionary practices should be prohibited. That is the purpose that Article 102 serves, and the wealth of Commission decisions and case law demonstrates that it has been used to serve that purpose effectively.","2620":"It follows that structural competition problems that do not result from the abuse an undertaking's dominant position cannot be punished under Article 102. However, as explained in the answer to question 11.3, should the Commission deem that this has led to the creation of \"enforcement gaps\", it must also realise that this is the result of the way the provisions of Article 102 were drafted; such \"gaps\" are therefore substantial in nature. They are not procedural, and thus cannot be addressed simply by providing the Commission with additional enforcement powers. These \"gaps\" are in fact inherent to European Competition Law as it was drafted by the Treaty founders and were intended to lead to the enforcement system that the Commission now seeks to amend.","2621":"Therefore, should the Commission believe that these \"gaps\" are the source of structural competition problems which need to be addressed, it is once again submitted that the only appropriate way to do so would be to amend the provisions of Article 102, or to add additional prohibitions under European Competition law. In any case, this could only be achieved through a revision of the TFEU.","2622":"As previously explained, the Commission cites Article 103 TFEU as a basis for this New Tool in its Inception Impact Assessment. However, this article enables the Commission to propose legislation to \u201cgive effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102\u201d, \"ensure compliance with the prohibitions\" or \" define the scope of the provisions\". It thus follows that any legislation based on Article 103 would have to be consistent with the provisions of Article 101 and 102 and would therefore not be able to prohibit behaviours or conducts which are not already prohibited under Article 102, including anti-competitive monopolisation strategies by non-dominant undertakings.Not applicableThe question of whether there exist practices that do not fall within the scope of Articles 101 and 102 is blindsiding and carefully avoids asking the most relevant question.","2623":"Practices that do not constitute an infringement of Articles 101 and 102 are not deemed anticompetitive under EU law. They thus fall outside the scope of the Commission's enforcement powers under the Treaties. Therefore, imposing remedies of any kind on an undertaking without having established an infringement of EU Competition rules on their part would be in breach of the TFEU. ","2624":"Contrary to what seems to be implied in question 24, this New Competition Tool will not change or amend \"current competition law enforcement\", because it will not change the rules on which it is based - EU Competition Law - short of creating new competition rules that would encompass the structural competition problems that the Commission seeks to eliminate. Enforcement practice will remain within the boundaries of Arts. 101 and 102 in the absence of a Treaty revision.","2625":"When a market does not provide satisfactory outcomes, i.e. where there is a market failure which cannot be resolved by bringing enforcement proceedings because it does not result from an infringement, the issue ceases to be a matter for the enforcement authority. This does not mean that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU cease to be suitable and effective; they still serve their purpose, but the issues that they are meant to resolve are not the root cause of the problem. It is no more a question of enforcement but of policy. It is therefore up to the lawmaker to step in to enact sector-specific legislation which will address these problems, the structural lack of competition and the resulting market failure.","2626":"It is unclear from the Commission's roadmap whether the intention here is truly to cover any alleged \"gap\" which may have purportedly arisen in the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 or whether the intention is rather, in some small part, to tackle cases that could otherwise have been addressed through competition law enforcement but would be harder to prove under infringement proceedings due, for example, to exacting evidentiary standards.","2627":"In any case, should the Commission believe that, regardless of the sector of the European Economy under consideration, practices exist that it deems should be held as anticompetitive and against which it should be empowered to bring infringement proceedings, but which are not caught under the relevant Treaty provisions, then it is submitted that this issue cannot be resolved through the adoption of ordinary legislation. New competition rules will need to be established, or current rules amended, which will require amending the TFEU.As explained above, practices that do not constitute an infringement of Articles 101 and 102 are not deemed anticompetitive under EU law. They thus fall outside the scope of the Commission's enforcement powers under the Treaties. Therefore, imposing remedies of any kind on an undertaking without having established an infringement of EU Competition rules on their part would be in breach of the TFEU. This reasoning applies a fortiori in situations where neither an infringement of EU Competition Law NOR even the existence of structural competition problems have been established.","2628":"The Commission is already well equipped to make non binding recommendations to companies, inform and make recommendations to sectorial regulators and make legislative recommendations, and performs these kind of activities on a regular basis today. A New Competition Tool is not required to that end, nor has a case been made that the NCT would allow it to serve these objectives any better than it already can through the sector inquiries provide under article 17 of Regulation 1\/2003. ","2629":"The Commission should not be empowered to impose remedies on companies which have not been found in breach of European Competition Law, as such remedies should be reserved exclusively for situations in which they are strictly necessary to bring such an infringement to an end.Under Regulation 1\/2003, structural and behavioural remedies are described as remedies to an infringement of EU competition law, and as means by which to put an end to said infringement.\n \nArticle 7(1) of Regulation 1\/2003 provides: \u2018Where the Commission, acting on a complaint or on its own initiative, finds that there is an infringement of Article [101] or of Article [102] of the Treaty, it may by decision require the undertakings and associations of undertakings concerned to bring such infringement to an end. For this purpose, it may impose on them any behavioural or structural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed and necessary to bring the infringement effectively to an end. [...]\u2019","2630":"The European lawmaker has therefore laid down clear limits to the Commission\u2019s power to impose such remedies, to which the existence of an infringement is central. Structural and behavioural remedies may thus only be imposed on an undertaking that has been found liable of an infringement of competition law, and only insofar as these remedies are proportionate to this infringement, and necessary to bring it to an end. The use of these remedies is thus subject to a necessity and proportionality test. First and foremost, however, they are subject to the existence of an infringement.","2631":"The Commission is now seeking the power to impose such remedies in the absence of an infringement. This raises serious questions as to what the exact scope of action of the Commission will be, as to what will frame this power, what the objectives and boundaries thereof will be absent an infringement and what criteria will be use to perform the necessity and proportionality tests. ","2632":"Crucially, it raises the fundamental question of the legal basis to impose structural and behavioural remedies. Indeed, such remedies are provided for in Regulation 1\/2003 as means to put an end to a wrongdoing and to ensure an undertakings\u2019 continued compliance with the law. With this new tool, the Commission would not be seeking to put an end to a specific undertaking\u2019s wrongdoing, but rather to correct alleged structural competition problems on a market. The problems may be caused by the actions or activities of one or more undertakings, but, absent an infringement, these actions are not illegal; there is no wrongdoing to put an end to, and as problematic as an undertaking\u2019s behaviour may be perceived, it is, from a legal point of view, complying with the law, as no infringement could be established, and thus strictly innocent under the law. There is therefore no legal basis, that is to say no legal justification in imposing remedies on this undertaking.","2633":"Structural remedies are a powerful weapon in the hands of a competition authority, and one which should not be wielded lightly, as they allow the authority to restructure a market, typically to prevent future infringements, with potentially severe and lasting effects on the undertakings operating on this market. This type of remedies should therefore be reserved for the most extreme of cases. ","2634":"This principle is in fact enshrined in EU Law: Article 7(1) of Regulation 1\/2003 provides that '[...]Structural remedies can only be imposed either where there is no equally effective behavioural remedy or where any equally effective behavioural remedy would be more burdensome for the undertaking concerned than the structural remedy[...]'.","2635":"As explained in answer 31.1, the use of structural and behaviour remedies are subject to a necessity and proportionality test. Additionally, as indicated in the provisions of article 7(1) reproduced above, the use of structural remedies is further subject to an effectiveness test, and should only be relied upon should no behavioural remedy be equally effective as the considered structural remedy.","2636":"It follows that the Commission should not attempt to predetermine which cases, or which structural competition problems, if any, should be addressed through structural remedies. Rather, each situation should be assessed on a case-by-case basis; the Commission should first evaluate whether a specific problem can be resolved through behavioural remedies, preferably through commitment decisions and in the context of an open dialogue with the undertakings active on the market. Only after having exhausted every other avenue should the Commission consider imposing structural remedies. ","2637":"Nevertheless, it is submitted here that, should the proposed New Competition Tool be enacted, resulting investigations carried out by the Commission should, indeed, be subject to binding legal deadlines. This New Tool should not be relied upon to develop a system of constant market surveillance through which a Competition Authority would monitor markets in perpetuity. Market investigations bring considerable burden and uncertainty for the undertakings involved; these widely deter investment, including in research and innovation. Long-term investigation may have a detrimental effect on undertakings involved, including on those which may ultimately be cleared of suspicion.The New Competition Tool would empower the Commission to impose remedies in the absence of any infringement, i.e. before the fact, prior to any wrongdoing. Furthermore, it would allow the Commission to intervene in markets where there is a 'structural risk for competition', meaning is situations where neither an infringement nor a market failure has yet been established. ","2638":"In any case, considering the level of ex-ante intervention which this New Tool would empower the Commission to deploy, it is difficult to see how the ability to impose interim measures would be of further benefit. Interim measures could even create more uncertainty and create unnecessary and illegitimate burden on undertakings as they could be imposed on the basis of a preliminary assessment the conclusions of which may ultimately be proved unfounded. Furthermore, this will raise the question of the Commission's liability should interim measures be overturned by the Courts.Voluntary commitments have proven very effective in situations where, in the context of an infringement proceeding, undertakings have made sufficient concessions to satisfy the Commission. Should this New Competition Tool be adopted, the possibility for undertakings to seek a settlement should be included.The possibility for parties with an interest in the case under investigation to be heard, especially where their intervention may help shed light on some of the issues under investigation, is an essential procedural tool to ensure respect for the rule of law. This is particularly true for parties that would seek to be heard on behalf of a defendant, as this would ensure someSee answer to question 37.1.Such safeguards exists in jurisdictions that have granted similar market investigation powers on their Competition authority. By way of example, in the United-Kingdom, detailed guidelines apply to the conduct of market investigations, including precise timescales that envisage site visits, the publication of working papers and annotated issues statements, a series of hearings with concerned parties, and consultation on any recommended remedies. ","2639":"This level of engagement and transparency does not currently apply to the Commission\u2019s enforcement powers, and it is concerning that such safeguards were not contemplated in the Commission's inception impact assessment for the NCT . Should the Commission be granted these new market investigation powers, it would appear crucial that they be accompanied by safeguards that are at the very least as strong as those provided under UK law. ","2640":"Furthermore, UK law also provides for strong judicial review by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). Decisions taken by the Commission under the New Competition Tool will likely be subject to judicial review by the Court of Justice regardless of whether underlying legal instrument specifically provides for it or not. Nevertheless, the standard of that review will be crucial but was not considered in the Commission's roadmap either.","2641":"Such safeguards are essential and should not be considered as an afterthought. They should be fully integrated to any enforcement system by design, to ensure that they are effective in securing the rights of the defence. These should include interim relief in Court should the Commission be empowered to order preliminary or interim measures. This is especially importance for structural remedies. In such cases, the burden of proof should fall on the Commission.When structural competition problems on a market are caused by practices which constitute infringements of competition rules, the appropriate way to address them is for a competition authority to bring proceedings against wrongdoers and put an end to these infringements, thereby solving the competition problems. To the extent that they are the result of an infringement, then Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are suitable and sufficiently effective to address these competition problems.","2642":"Should the Commission deem that structural competition problems exist on specific markets that cannot currently be adequately remedied through infringement proceedings, it is submitted that the appropriate way to address this issue under the EU Treaties is for the Commission to propose sector-specific legislation to the co-legislator. In fact, situations which the Commission describes in its inception impact assessment under point (i) of the section on \"Structural lack of competition\" refer to scenario in which markets display \"systemic failures going beyond the conduct of a particular company with market power due to certain structural features, such as high concentration and entry barriers, consumer lock-in, lack of access to data or data accumulation\" (the situations described in point (ii) have been addressed in answers to other questions). Such situations of systemic market failure, regardless of whether they are caused by anti-competitive practices actionable under Article 101 and 102, are grounds for the Commission to propose sector-specific legislation. Such a tool is far more efficient and effective to address such deep-rooted issues than remedies imposed on individual undertakings. This rationale is no doubt at least in part at the source of the forthcoming proposal for a Digital Services Act (DSA).","2643":"It is unclear therefore what \"gap\" this New Competition tool is meant to fill, what benefits this tool would bring in addition to the rules that will be laid down in the DSA, or whether it is, in fact intended to complement it. The Inception Impact Assessment is indeed ambivalent as to the exact scope of this new tool, makes little if any reference to sectors that are characterised by the presence of large platforms, and heavily suggests that the tool could - and should - in fact apply to all sectors of the economy.","2644":"Access Now defends and extends the digital rights of users at risk around the world.

However, instead of contributing to diversity of offers online, the omnipresence of these platforms means that it is often virtually impossible for people to not use them online. This was confirmed by a journalist conducting an experience for Gizmodo and the New York Times where she tried to cut all products and services from Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft from her life. For instance, cutting Amazon out of her life meant that she could not only not access Amazon MarketPlace or online video services, but also most websites available on the internet as Amazon Web Services is the largest cloud provider and now a significant part of the internet infrastructure. She concluded \u201cAfter the experiment was over, though, I went back to using the companies\u2019 services again, because as it demonstrated, I didn\u2019t really have any other choice.\u201d (https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/07\/31\/technology\/blocking-the-tech-giants.html) \n- Information asymmetry on the customer side, data dependency and zero-price markets:\nOnline platforms request users to accept lengthy and vague terms of service agreements that set the rules for their online experience. These ToS are not necessarily in line with EU Regulations, nor do they provide meaningful protection or information to people. However, people tend to \u201cagree\u201d to these terms due to dark patterns used by these companies to coerce their agreement. As a result, people are not aware of how platforms truly operate, including how their personal information may be used for the benefit of these platforms and often well-beyond what is foreseeable and necessary for these online services to functions. Platforms rely on this information asymmetry to solidify their data harvesting practices and solidify their powers, in particular in zero-price markets.\n- The platform owner is competing with the business users on the platform:\nDuring the antitrust hearing held in the United States in July 2020, the economic impact of the invasive data practices of large platforms was revealed. In fact, platforms use data unlawfully acquired to reinforce their market position and hurt competition. For instance, in April, the Wall Street Journal published a report stating that Amazon employees have used data from individual sellers to help Amazon decide which private-label products to pursue under its own private-label brands, such as Amazon Basics. (https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015)\nCEO Jeff Bezos indicated that while this practice is not in line with Amazon\u2019s policy, he could not deny that this was happening and that an internal investigation was being conducted to address this issue. In the meantime, Amazon sellers have to continue work within a platform that \u201c[has] never been a great partner, but you have to work with them\u201d, as they told the US Congress subcommittee, illustrating the lock-in effect. \nFinally, it shall be noted that regulatory intervention from the EU when geared at protecting people\u2019s fundamental rights or consumer rights should not be considered barriers to entry in markets. On the contrary, lack of compliance by certain actors should be viewed as a distortion of competition rules as they could result in unfair advantage for actors who flout the rules over companies that invest resources in protecting people.The following market scenarios may qualify as structural competition problems as illustrated by the examples below:\n- A company with market power in a core market extends that market power to related markets:\nIn 2007, Google announced that it was acquiring DoubleClick, a leading provider of \u2018ad serving\u2019 technology, for $3.1 billion. Both Google and DoubleClick are active in the online advertising market which at the time was still in its relative infancy but they played different roles. At the time, Google was a leader in paid search, as an ad publisher and as an intermediary with its ad network AdSense but it had a relatively small presence in serving ads. This merger led Google to becoming a dominant player in all aspects of the online ad market, increasing its market power and vertical integration. \n(https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/why-did-google-buy-doubleclick-22e706e1fb07) \n- Anti-competitive monopolisation:\nIn addition to the data practices mentioned in our answer to question 6 that large platforms use to reinforce their power over competitors, companies also undercut rivals. \nAmazon regularly offers its own products below cost or retail price - this practice ranges from home speakers to diapers. Amazon has for instance been accused of driving \u201cdiapers.com\u201d out of business by selling products at a loss.\nSimilarly, Apple and Android use their power as operating systems to favour their own apps and services in their App stores or to pre-install their services on devices. A report from the Wall Street Journal showed that in 60 percent of app categories on the App Store, Apple ranked its own apps first. (https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apple-dominates-app-store-search-results-thwarting-competitors-11563897221) \n- Highly concentrated markets & gatekeeper scenario:\nDocuments produced for the US antitrust hearing show that Apple gave Amazon a preferential treatment to get Prime Video into App Store. In fact, Apple agreed to only take 15% of revenue from Prime Video subscriptions made on iOS, versus the 30% they were taking from other businesses. This happened despite the fact that Apple owns Apple TV, a competitor to Amazon Prime Video. Most recently, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging antitrust violations for pulling the popular Fortnite out of the Apple App Store because Epic included a way for players to cut Apple out of its mandatory 30% cut on sales. With this rule, Apple therefore dictates who gets to offer its products and discriminates between players. (https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/7\/30\/21348108\/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions)\nApple and Google\u2019s Android software also hold a duopoly on the smartphone market, users have no other choice but to use one of the two options. A journalist wanting to avoid both companies, ended up having to user a \u201cdumb phone\u201d with no internet access which can therefore not compare to the services offered on smartphones. (https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/07\/31\/technology\/blocking-the-tech-giants.html)\n- Tipping markets: \nThe same journalist tried to avoid Facebook social media services and used competitors for a while. While a few alternatives exist, most people use Facebook services, in particular due to strong network effects, which means that competitors have no to little chance to either take over or significantly impact Facebook\u2019s market share.\nTo sum up, while it is true that most large platforms have competitors in different markets and that alternatives for products and services offered by the tech giants exist, they are harder to find and to use due to lock-in and network effect. In addition, Amazon and Google now provide critical services for the very infrastructure of the internet, so much so that even their competitors had to rely on their services. The New York Times journalist who tried to stop using their services noted that \u201cthese companies control a thicket of more obscure products and services that are hard to untangle from tools we rely on for everything we do, from work to getting from point A to point B.\u201d Given the powers and gatekeepers role that these platforms hold over online services, the fact that alternative exists is almost irrelevant. The five tech giants have become so omnipresent that it is simply no longer possible for people to move away from them or \u201cgo use other products'' without being cut off from other services.","2647":"The many yet non exhaustive lists of unfair practices we provided in our previous answers can harm human rights and lead to reducing the numbers of businesses which in turn reduce choice for users and harm innovation.\nMany of the data practices used by large platforms fail to comply with the EU data protection regime and infringe on people\u2019s rights. In addition, the obscure terms of services which often place companies' policies above the laws often seek to limit people\u2019 right to remedy and in practice their ability to reach court or supervisory authorities. \nIn buying out competitors, extending their market powers or distorting rules, large platforms negatively impact competition by making competitors disappear and hurt innovation by either copying new products or interfering in their success. The Commission must intervene to stop a small number of platforms from picking winners and losers of the digital single market.\nYes, the Commission should explore possibilities to intervene proactively in digital and non-digital markets to address anti-competitive behaviours of actors that impacts innovations and users\u2019 rights, including the rights to privacy and data protection. ","2648":"We encourage the Commission to develop a new tool for competition with a market structure-based approach and a horizontal scope. Digital innovations have the potential to increase users\u2019 benefits, however a number of large platforms are becoming gatekeepers for many digital products, services and even access to users. These platforms have sometimes established dominant positions but not always. In any case, they hold significant market power as a result of massive data collection and harvesting practices that lead to concentration of power in one or more markets, exacerbating lock-in and network effects, as well as information asymmetries. By designing a new competition tool that focuses on a market structure-approach rather than a dominance one, the Commission will be able to more comprehensively address the competitive shortcoming of different markets.","2649":"We have identified anti-competitive monopolisation strategies in, at least the following markets:\n- Social media,\n- Online marketplaces,\n- Search engines, and\n- Apps stores.Startups or scale-ups and other small businesses often depend on large online platforms to grow and reach users. In fact, businesses selling goods on Amazon said that \u201c[Amazon has] never been a great partner, but you have to work with them\u201d. (https:\/\/www.vox.com\/recode\/2020\/7\/29\/21346584\/jeff-bezos-amazon-antitrust-hearing-congressional-testimony-power-to-make-or-break-small-merchants)\nWhen competitors or smaller companies do not follow the rules set by the handful of tech giants, the larger players have means to block their access to existing or new customers and ultimately can push them out of business. Recently, Epic Games has filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging antitrust violations for pulling the popular Fortnite out of the Apple App Store because Epic included a way for players to cut Apple out of its mandatory 30% cut on sales. Developers refusing to give Apple this cut cannot make their apps available in the store. \nTech giants frequently use talking points on \u201chelping small business\u201d as a lobby argument to pretend that they do not abuse their dominant position in several markets and to argue for less \u201cburdensome\u201d regulatory frameworks. It is clear however that start-ups and small businesses who do not follow the rules set by giants or whose market share are rising are seen as a \u201cthreat\u201d that needs to be \u201celiminated\u201d quickly. This often happens through acquisition or by copying of their innovation - so that large companies can keep their market powers. (See: https:\/\/www.economist.com\/business\/2018\/06\/02\/american-tech-giants-are-making-life-tough-for-startups) For instance, documents produced for the antitrust hearing held in the United States in July 2020, showed that Facebook decided to buy Instagram as they fear that \u201cif [Instagram] grow to a large scale the could be very disruptive to us\u201d. (https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/7\/29\/21345723\/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing) \nTech giants are using their power and access to capital to buy products built by smaller businesses, acquire market position, and increase profits. In fact, over the last 3 decades, the GAFAM \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft \u2014 have collectively bought around 770 companies. These acquisitions have continued during the Covid-19 pandemic, as these companies registered record high earnings while many other businesses were forced to close. (https:\/\/www.cbinsights.com\/research\/tech-giants-billion-dollar-acquisitions-infographic\/)\nUsers lock-in, unfair advantage acquired through unlawful data harvesting practice, and information asymmetry create difficulties for new and small businesses to enter or compete fairly in the digital single market. This is to the detriment of users\u2019 rights and choice, to competition and to innovation.","2650":"Anti-competitive monopolisation strategies may lead to unfair practices and can have an impact on people\u2019s fundamental rights, including freedom of information and freedom of the press. In fact, Google and Facebook are using their market powers in the search and social media markets, respectively, to gather an increasing share of advertising revenue, imperilling the business model of companies employing journalists and content creators. Google has substantial market power in the supply of search advertising while Facebook has substantial market power in the supply of display advertising.\nGoogle and Facebook\u2019s powers in the search and social media markets are likely to be kept due to the dark patterns these companies use to keep users on its platforms, even when serving ads. A detailed investigation by the Markup and reported by Wired found that \u201cin 15,000 queries examined, nearly half of the first page of mobile search results were designed to keep the user on Google, rather than directing them to another website. Those responses consisted of both Google\u2019s own properties and the \u201cdirect answers,\u201d the snippets Google pulls from outside sites to display right in the results.\u201d (See https:\/\/themarkup.org\/google-the-giant\/2020\/07\/28\/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors and https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/blurred-lines-closed-loops-google-search\/)\nGoogle Search has around 92 percent of global search market share and Facebook counts 7 billion users. A significant number of media businesses in Europe and elsewhere rely on news referral services from Google and Facebook. This not only means that Google and Facebook are now unavoidable partners for media outlets to reach readers online but it also provides the tech giants with substantial bargaining power in their dealings with these media businesses. The lock-in effect created by Google and Facebook creates competition problems which in turns create risk for media freedom and access to information.We encourage the Commission to develop a New Competition tool with a market structure-based approach and a horizontal scope. By designing a tool that focuses on a market structure-approach rather than a dominance one, the Commission will be able to more comprehensively address the competitive shortcoming of different markets. The examples we provide in our answer to this consultation shows that online tech platforms regularly use their power in one market to extend their share in other markets. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple are multi-sided platforms in nature which means that the Commission should be able to look at the cross-market impacts of these actors on competition. We also encourage the Commission to work closely with regulators in the area of data protection, privacy, and access to information to evaluate how the business models of these platforms impact other businesses like media and users\u2019 rights. The potential new competition tool should create a framework to address issues that impact the power relationship between large players and their competitors on the one hand, and with online users on the other. Competition issues have an impact on the fairness of the market beyond the current scope of competition law. This framework should be developed in alignment with other legislative and policy initiatives including the Digital Services Act package, the European Democracy Action Plan, rules on automated decision-making systems, and finally with rules regulating ad tech and data protection enforcement.","2651":"Given the multi-sided nature of the tech giants and their presence all over the online environment, it is nearly impossible to list specific markets where these companies may act as oligopoly. The behaviour of tech giants towards each other shows how they rely on each other to continue to grow and how the anti-competitive behaviour of one may still affect the others.  \nFor instance, Apple has often suspended or limited access to apps created or owned by Facebook for breaking the policies of its App Stores. Apple however never suspended Facebook\u2019s main apps (Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram), which provide Facebook with nearly exclusive access to the hundreds of millions of people who use the service, and see its ads, in Apple iOS. Apple is sending a message to Facebook: \u201cwe are only partners, or allies, as long as both parties agree.\u201d \nFacebook could escalate the situation, too, if it wanted, by removing all of its apps from iOS, and preventing Apple users from easily accessing its services. The consequences could be disastrous for both companies given people and businesses reliance on these platforms and hardware which are slowly becoming the blueprint of the online environment. But while tech giants may be able to poke each other from time to time to make each other move in the same direction, everyone else is left watching. It is nearly impossible for other companies outside the GAFAM to be able to compete at that level, users have no voices, and regulators are only able to intervene in limited feud but not in fixing damaging structural competition issues, so far.We have limited knowledge on the features of oligopolistic markets but we note their impacts in our answer to question 12.2.","2652":"The following markets, in particular, are particularly prone to becoming tipping markets:\n- Social media,\n- Search engines, and\n- Messaging services.\nDespite the countless scandals involving Facebook over the past years - from repeated privacy violations, too loose content moderation policies, or abuses of the platforms to interfere with elections worldwide - its services remain used by a large number of people and businesses globally. This does not mean that users do not care about these abuses but it partially illustrates the power of this company to lock users in due to the difficulties to switch to other platforms as someone\u2019s network needs to follow them for such a move to be viable. Facebook is conscious of this power and does its best to expand it by also ensuring that people can log in to multiple services online, including to competitors\u2019 platforms via a so-called \u201cFacebook log in\u201d. This is the case for Pinterest, Spotify, and many other platforms. Google offers similar log in options. Under the cover of convenience, these companies lock us into their services, learn more about our behaviour, and ascertains powers over the other platforms. In doing so, Facebook and Google become gatekeepers for users\u2019 access to services.In our previous answer (16.2), we have highlighted how direct and indirect network effects, as well as single-home or single-log-in contribute to the creation of tipping markets.","2653":"In tipping markets, large platforms negatively impact competition, consumer choice and hurt innovation by interfering in how consumers behave online. By using dark patterns, single log-in or unilateral terms of conditions for the use of their devices or operating systems, a handful of tech giants decide the rules for nearly everyone in the online environment: from which content we find to which apps we can download. Their powers are such that in several parts of the world the names \u201cGoogle\u201d or \u201cFacebook\u201d are now used as equivalent to the internet. (This tendency is also reinforced by business practices that go beyond the scope of this consultation but that violate net neutrality principles and seriously impact the right to access to the internet and different fundamental rights.) The internet and the web, which were built and thought to be open and diverse, are slowly falling into the hands of 5-6 companies that are exercising ever growing control over the content and the infrastructure of the online environment.The Commission should develop a new competition tool which allows for early intervention in tipping markets to correct and potentially prohibit certain behaviour. A number of large platforms are becoming gatekeepers for many digital products, services and even access to users. These platforms hold significant market power as a result of massive data collection and harvesting practices that lead to concentration of power in one or more markets, exacerbating lock-in and network effects, as well as information asymmetries. These platforms should not become a single entry point to services and a gatekeeper to users\u2019 access via log-ins.","2654":"As noted in the joint letter signed by more than 20 NGOs submitted in the roadmap on an ex-ante regulation, \u201cwe believe that this small number of large online platforms not only act as economic gatekeepers, but also as 'fundamental rights' gatekeepers. Through their business models, their terms of services and community guidelines, these platforms set standards in the market with regards to, among others, consumers' rights to privacy, data protection and freedom of expression. These large platforms are able to do so because, on the one hand, barriers to entry are so high that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for new players to enter the market and put competitive pressure on gatekeepers. On the other hand, because consumers do not have viable alternatives to switch to.\u201dPlatforms act as gatekeepers when they determine alone how users and third party businesses interact on their platform and they hold the power to change these rules at any point in time. They can decide how online interactions happen as no viable alternative exists for online users or they are still dependent on these large platforms in one way or another. For instance, Amazon can decide which sellers operate on its platforms while also deciding to put its own cheaper products next to it. Apple and Android can decide which apps are available in their Apps Store, request a share of the sale for allowing an app on it while also offering a cheaper rate to other partners. These decisions are based on the company's unilateral conditions applied to other business platforms although these behaviours raise serious questions as regards their compliance with several EU laws, including on competition.We support the objective of the Commission expressed in the roadmap on a new competition tool to \u201cexplore possibilities to intervene proactively in digital and non-digital markets to address anti-competitive behaviours of actors that impacts innovations\u201d and users\u2019 rights, including the rights to privacy and data protection. ","2655":"We encourage the Commission to intervene in the gatekeeper scenario through the development and use of a new tool for competition with a market structure-based approach and a horizontal scope.

In any case, they hold significant market power as a result of massive data collection and harvesting practices that lead to concentration of power in one or more markets, exacerbating lock-in and network effects, as well as information asymmetries. \nIn addition, the boundaries between digital and non-digital markets are increasingly hard to draw and platforms often engage on both. What is more, some platforms may benefit from their gatekeepers role in one market (such as the presentation of online ads for example) to further ascertain their dominance in another market (such as social media or search for instance).","2656":"A large number of platforms have acquired significant powers in different markets of the EU digital single market (online ad, search, online marketplace, social media, news aggregation, video games, etc) through unlawful data harvesting practices. These practices are reinforced by the use of dark pattern design that coerced users in signing-up to obscure and lengthy terms of services and\/or the use of profiles. The Commission should prioritise efforts to enforce the GDPR and in particular the rules around data minimisation, purpose imitation, and data protection by design and by default to ensure that all companies operating in the EU market abide by the same standards and to foster the growth and development of sustainable tech alternatives. \nTo address existing power of a few platforms, the EU Commission should work with data protection authorities to request large companies having acquired personal data unlawfully to delete this information as allowing them to keep it would not only undermine the protection of people\u2019s fundamental rights but also give them an undue competitive advantage over companies that do respect the privacy and data protection rules. To do so, the Commission must ensure that member states provide data protection authorities with sufficient human and financial resources so that they perform their duty. Politico Europe reported that many DPAs have been expressing their dissatisfaction with their current budget and resources. Out of 30 DPAs, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Iceland, only nine said they were happy with their level of resourcing. (See: https:\/\/pro.politico.eu\/news\/eu-privacy-regulators-alarm-problems-documents ) In our yearly report on the implementation of the GDPR, we further compared the level resources of Data Protection Authorities with those of the companies they are supposed to keep in check. Large tech companies have nearly endless financial resources in comparison to the restrictive budget allocated to Data Protection Authorities. In the case of Ireland, the revenue of some of these companies - like Facebook or Google - is even higher than the Gross Domestic Product of the country.

This includes monopolisation strategies by companies with market power, tipping markets, oligopolies and platforms acting not only as economic gatekeepers, but also as 'fundamental rights' gatekeepers. These structural competition problems may not be strictly covered under existing rules as it does necessarily involve agreements between companies. To address these issues and complement existing rules, and parallel ex-ante rules to be considered, we support the Commission developing a new tool for competition with a market structure-based approach and a horizontal scope.Our answers in the sections on anti-competitive monopolisation, oligopoly, tipping market and structural competition problems provide concrete examples of problematic situations.Structural issues identified in this consultation do not necessarily arise from situations where a company has a dominant position in the internal market, or at least that factor alone is not the main competitive issue. What is more, the issues identified with tipping markets, network effect, lock-in scenarios and others would be best addressed early on rather than having to wait for a company to be holding a monopolistic position in the market.

Whether markets are purely digital such as online search for instance or more \u201ctraditional\u201d like media or advertising, the activities of online platforms is likely to impact them. We therefore consider that the new competition tool should apply horizontally to all markets.The structural competition issue identified in this consultation that shall be addressed by a new competition tool must be addressed with rules that are clear and predictable.\nWe therefore recommend that the Commission move away from promoting or encouraging self-regulatory or co-regulatory frameworks that give too much discretion to platforms and can even be used for them to reinforce their power over other actors of the digital single market. The actions of large platforms have impacts on the rights and freedoms of millions of users and businesses which requires measures governing their practices to be accessible, transparent and provide legal certainty.To be effective, the new competition tool developed by the European Commission should provide for an array of options for remedies to be applied to the different structural competition problems, market failures and consumer harms identified. This can include prohibition of certain behaviour such as merging of data between services or obligation to modify part of business-model if they are considered too intrusive for users\u2019 rights and damaging for competition such as behavioural advertisements. In some cases, these remedies may go hand in hand with data protection sanctions that can be imposed by data protection authorities (such as requests for specific processing of data to stop or requests for data to be deleted if acquired or processed unlawfully).","2660":"A number of structural competition problems identified in this consultation are linked to the unlawful data harvesting practices of large platforms.The Commission should prioritise efforts to enforce the General Data Protection Regulation and in particular the rules around data minimisation, purpose imitation, and data protection by design and by default to ensure that all companies operating in the EU market abide by the same standards and to foster the growth and development of sustainable tech alternatives. \nTo address existing power of a few platforms, the EU Commission should work with data protection authorities to request large companies having acquired personal data unlawfully to delete this information as allowing them to keep it would not only undermine the protection of people\u2019s fundamental rights but also give them an undue competitive advantage over companies that do respect the privacy and data protection rules. \nMore broadly, to ensure proper and sustainable enforcement of the GDPR, the Commission must ensure that member states provide data protection authorities with sufficient human and financial resources so that they perform their duty.

We reiterate our call for the Commission to work with other supervisory authorities who may have investigated specific companies behaviour or similar issues - from data protection authorities to telecoms regulators and national competition authorities.To make an informed and reasoned decision, the Commission shall be able to address requests for information to companies who in return should have an obligation to reply. This also provides an opportunity to the company under scrutiny to explain its activities and provide documentation. Competitors and users shall also be able to provide information to ensure that the Commission gathers information for each potentially affected party.Given the scope of issues to be addressed by this new tool and the strong focus on addressing issues early on, even before they create (more) damage to competition and users\u2019 rights, there is a need to act swift and ensure that investigations are not dragged on. In some cases, if issues are not remedied early on, it is often practically impossible to fix them without further action. For instance, when Facebook promised to the Commission to not merge WhatsApp data with other services and later did so; even if the Commission ask the company to now separate this data (which it should) this would not fully remedy the data protection violations that may have been happening in the meantime and it does not address the fact that Facebook has used this data to grow its power in the messaging market.  \nClear deadlines shall be set for each part of the investigation both for the production of documents and answers on behalf of the companies and for the Commission to come to a conclusion. Sanctions should be applied if such deadlines are not respected and temporary measures shall be applied on company while the investigation is ongoing to prevent risk of structural competition issues.We support the application of interim measures on companies in order to pre-empt irreparable while the investigation is ongoing. These measures may include the prohibition of certain practices (eg. data processing, stopping the use of algorithms, etc).The remedies imposed on companies to address identified and demonstrated structural competition problems shall be determined by the European Commission and be mandatory. Companies, including large online platforms, regrettably have a history of misleading the Commission and other authorities regarding the measures that they promise to put in place. If companies have the discretion to propose measures, they may be considered voluntary by them or open to their own interpretation. This would not create certainty for other actors in the market and for users.Competitors, other companies operating in affected markets, suppliers and users shall also be able to provide information to ensure that the Commission gathers information for each potentially affected party.To prevent abuse and to clearly separate the role of actors within investigation, we recommend that only the Commission and relevant regulators should be involved in determining the appropriateness and proportionality of remedies. Affected parties should however have a right to contest the decision if they consider that certain factors have not been taken into account or that the proposed remedy does not address harms.People and businesses\u2019 right to remedy should be guaranteed in this context. To ensure however that this does not risk delaying the application of remedy to structural competition issues, the process should be as fast as possible.We support the objective of the Commission to explore avenues to tackle the negative societal and economic effects of the gatekeeper role that large online platform companies exercise over whole platform ecosystems. To do this, the Commission should intervene in three areas.  \nFirst, via the Digital Services Act framework to propose clearer rules on liability, transparency, and responsibility of platforms. \nSecond, the Commission should intervene proactively in digital and non-digital markets to address anti-competitive behaviours of actors that impacts innovations and users\u2019 rights, including the rights to privacy and data protection. We encourage the Commission to develop a new competition tool (NCT) with a market structure-based approach and a horizontal scope. A number of large platforms are becoming gatekeepers for many digital products, services and even access to users. These platforms have sometimes established dominant positions but not always. In any case, they hold significant market power as a result of massive data collection and harvesting practices that lead to concentration of power in one or more markets, exacerbating lock-in and network effects, as well as information asymmetries.

A good example is Google, which is currently expanding its dominance in several markets, including the vacation rental market in which we operate. Google announced in 2019 that it was expanding its \u201csearch experience to include a wider assortment of vacation rental properties worldwide\u201d. This means that Google started displaying vacation rentals from a variety of partners, some of which signed this letter. These offers for vacation rentals can be seen, searched for and compared within Google\u2019s new product Google Vacation Rentals. With a few clicks the offers can then also be booked. Accordingly, Google advertises its new service as a tool to \u201c[f]ind and book vacation rentals, with help from Google\u201d.4 The competition concerns arise from the fact that Google features its new product in a visually-rich OneBox at the top of its general search results pages \u2013 a ranking and display that Google reserves only for its own specialised search service. The prominent feature includes pictures, a map preview, ratings and prices \u2013 a user experience like any other vacation rentals search service. As the Commission established in its Google Search (Shopping) decision5, such favourable ranking and display secures Google\u2019s service more user attention and clicks than any competing service may acquire, even if these are more relevant for the user\u2019s search query. \nTo make matters worse, Google discriminates amongst competitors regarding a participating in Google Vacation Rentals: At the moment, only a few big companies have been approached by Google to share their content. Google argues that a lack of staff and technical issues do not allow to involve all businesses immediately. As a result, SMBs suffer twofold. They are excluded from the traffic generated by Google Vacation Rentals and the OneBox severely reduces the traffic from organic or paid search results to their sites.\nAccordingly Google\u2019s competitors are put at a disadvantage.--We have witnessed the same conduct in the hotel intermediation industry and understand that this conduct may still be investigated by the Commission. This shows that this issue is prevalent across many industries and shows no sign of stopping. In the case of vacation rentals, Google\u2019s abusive conduct just started. \nThe Commission must address the leveraging practice before it has irreversible effects. As you rightly pointed out in the past, in digital markets we \u201cneed to act quickly. Because, once a market has tipped, it becomes very hard to bring competition back to the market\u201d.6 \nWithout intervention, Google\u2019s practices will continue to restricts competition and will ultimately lead to less choice and higher prices for consumers. \nSuggested intervention includes the prohibition, by law or otherwise, of the practices referred to above (Technical tying: self-referencing; Anti-competitive foreclosure).-------","2662":"--The dedicated tool should authorise the dedicated authority to implement remedies on those companies that fail to respect the different regulatory obligations imposed on them.

There is therefore quasi-unanimity among competition policy experts that these factors create structural competition problems in that in a number of digital markets (search, social networks, etc.), the winner takes it all and it is difficult to challenge its market power through new entry.  ","2665":" The fact that some platforms, such as Google and Facebook are allowed to combine the data they collect through their various user-facing products (e.g., Search, YouTube, Instagram) and business-facing products (online advertising intermediation services, etc.) also protects their dominance in some markets and makes market entry difficult. As long as this combination of data (or data bundling) is allowed competition is unlikely to occur on a range of digital markets dominated by these platforms.  ","2666":" Zero pricing policies are also problematic because as a result of such policies the only way for companies to compete is for them to generate advertising revenues, which is not always possible considering the dominance of companies such as Google and Facebook on advertising markets (which is in turn helped by the fact they are allowed to combine data collected over a range of products). This creates a vicious circle: Google provides free services in a range of new markets (travel booking, etc.) because it can cross-subsidize these revenues through online advertising revenues (Search ads) and the free services on these new markets allow it to collect more data, which strengthen its dominance in search, online advertising, etc. This not only destroys existing competition in a range of markets, but also allows Google to strengthen its market power in markets where no competition exists.

It is doing so whilst applying different rules to its own vertically integrated advertising business.  As app developers look to other ways to fund app and content investment in iOS, it is likely that many will seek payment from consumers through the app store.  In the absence of regulatory intervention to enable competition in payment options through the app store, Apple\u2019s rigid app store developer guidelines will mean that it will benefit from this scenario too.We think that the four most problematic scenarios are those involving: ","2668":"Vertical leveraging: As illustrated by the Google decisions of the Commission, as well as by its investigations into the Apple App Store, the Facebook Marketplace and Amazon, digital gatekeepers seek to leverage the market power they have in their core market to adjacent markets. While competition law can be used to bring such attempts to an end, competition law investigations take time and competitive damage may be permanent by the time they are completed. ","2669":"Market tipping: Markets likes Algorithmic Search and Social Media may tip very quickly due inter alia to the presence of strong direct and indirect network effects. When tipping is facilitated by anticompetitive behaviour (exclusive dealing, etc.), competition law can be used to bring such behaviour to an end, but as noted above, competition proceedings may be too slow to prevent tipping. ","2670":"Gatekeeper scenarios: When digital platforms control access to a vast number of users, which do not multi-home, they may engage in both exclusionary and exploitative behaviours. For instance, they may self-preference their own products (e.g., Apple may preference Apple Music over Spotify) or they may impose unfair trading conditions on the users of their platforms (e.g., the App Store requirements that app developers use Apple\u2019s own in-app payment system and the charging of a 30% fee). ","2671":"Monopolization: EU competition law suffers from an enforcement gap here as Article 102 TFEU only becomes applicable when dominance can be shown. In markets that can quickly tip, this is problematic considering that it may delay intervention until such time a market has reached a point of no return.See our response to questions 8.3 and 8.4This strategy raises competition concerns because it can eliminate competition in an otherwise competitive market. ","2672":"For instance, if Google prominently features its own travel product (e.g., Google flight) on its SERP, it will give a strong competitive advantage to this product over competing products. In spite of the Google Shopping decision, Google continue this leveraging strategy, which is necessary to further incentivize Internet users to use Google Search and its other consumer-facing products, cement its data advantage and increase advertising opportunities. ","2673":"But the situation of Google is neither novel nor unique. It is not novel because vertical leveraging has been used by incumbents in network industries (telecoms, energy, etc.) until they were subject to regulation. And it is not unique as the other digital gatekeepers (Facebook, Apple and Amazon) engage in similar strategies.","2674":"Google\u2019s self-preferencing strategies on Search are the perfect example where a tool is needed to intervene in the case of repeated strategies. Although the Commission focused on the comparison shopping services market in its Google Shopping case, the same conduct affected many vertical markets. Because competition proceedings have to be manageable and therefore cannot involve too many vertical markets, and repeated proceedings against the same company for a similar conduct would absorb excessive resources, another tool is needed to address repeated strategies by digital gatekeepers. This tool should allow the Commission to address the problem at its sources and adopt remedies that would conduct the conduct \u201cas a whole\u201d rather than its impact in a narrow market.Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are flexible tool, but they have some limitations. In the case of Article 102 TFEU, dominance needs to be shown. Moreover, the Commission is subject to a heavy burden of proof, which it may have difficulties to meet in particularly complex and opaque markets. Remedies are also limited to addressing the competition concerns identified in the specific market(s) at hand. As a result, while Article 102 TFEU is the right instrument for the Commission to address a one-off conduct in a given market, it is not an ideal tool to address structural problems.Digital markets.It is not clear what the Commission means by \u201cputting competitors at a disadvantage in the market unfairly, for instance, by imposing unfair business practices or by limiting access to key inputs, such as data.\u201d ","2675":"Our understanding of the notion of monopolization is that it is a course of conduct pursued by a company in order to acquire monopoly power through anticompetitive means. Thus, unlike in the case of Article 102 TFEU, an antitrust intervention in monopolization cases does not require a showing of dominance. ","2676":"For instance, Apple imposes on a certain category of app developers (those providing digital goods and services) that need to use the App Store to reach iOS users to use its in-app payment system (IAP) and to pay a commission of 30%. By forcing these app developers to use IAP, Apple not only collects an unfairly high commission, but also gains access to critical user data (including name, address, credit card details and purchase history). There is no legal reason whatsoever why Apple should collect this data (as it does not provide the service), while not providing the service provider i.e. the publisher with access to  that data which is rightfully theirs. Rather, this is a business decision, seemingly driven by a desire on Apple\u2019s part, to own the customer relationship.","2677":"Google has also engaged in unfair practices. For instance, it has imposed on news publishers to adopt its Accelerated Mobile Pages (\u201cAMP\u201d) format on pain of having their news stories excluded from the Google News Carousel that occupies a large part of the SERP on mobile screen devices. This format is advantageous for Google (because all AMP pages are cached on its own servers, hence it captures all the interaction data between users and that content). By contrast, this format is unfavourable to news publishers because it commoditizes their content and reduce their monetization opportunities.see our response to question 10.3EU competition law suffers from an enforcement gaps because Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance to be applicable. This is a handicap in markets that can quickly tip since, by the time dominance has been reached by the firm engaging in unfair practices to the detriment of rivals, the market may have tipped and the damage to competition will be permanent.See our response to  question 10.7. Because digital markets can tip quickly, swift intervention, even below the dominance threshold level, may be necessary to protect competition.Article 101 TFEU may not be the right tool when the harmful conduct takes the formal of unilateral action and Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance, which may delay intervention until the damage to competition has become permanent.","2678":"-  E-commerce marketplace:   Here again, it seems that Amazon is an extremely strong market position, which will be hard to challenge by actual or potential rivals.When it comes to global platforms we don\u2019t think that our answers need much elaboration as the expert reports that have been prepared under the aegis of the EC (Competition Policy in a Digital Era), the UK government (the Furman report), the University of Chicago (Stigler report), etc., all confirm that the presence of the market features listed in question 10.3 makes a market prone to tipping. The evidence is overwhelming.Yes, see our response to question 16.2.It seems to us that the first four factors listed at 16.7 are both intimately linked and are very important. ","2679":"When a market tips, it is left with one monopolist market actor or one ultra-dominant market actor and several much weaker competitors. In this situation, efficient and innovative firms may be excluded because they may be unable to reach the scale (in terms for instance of number of customers, or volume of data needed) that is necessary to compete in the market. This will unavoidably impact customer choice and innovation as consumers may not have any real choice (they may, e.g., feel compelled to use Google Search although they may prefer to use a search engine with a greater focus on privacy) and harm innovation (as the super dominant firm may have reduced incentives to innovate  as was, e.g., the case with Internet Explorer, i.e. a browser in which Microsoft did not invest for a long period of time as it was super dominant). ","2680":"Monopolist will of course try to increase prices. In two-sided markets where the service is given away for free on one-side of the market, price increases can be excepted on the paying side (typically, online advertising).  Thus, while end-users on the free side of the market will not suffer from higher prices, advertisers may have to pay more to the platform (which may in turn impact their own customers in terms of higher pricesBecause it may be so hard to restore competition once the market has tipped, the Commission should have a tool that allows it to intervene because the market has tipped.Our view is that Articles 101-102 may not be sufficient to prevent tipping. Article 101 TFEU does not apply to unilateral conduct and Article 102 TFEU requires a showing of dominance, which may delay intervention. ","2681":"The lack of multi-homing is also an important factor as multi-homing constrains the market power of a digital platform. For instance, if each iOS device user also owned an Android device, it would be difficult for Apple to impose unfair trading terms on app developers. That is, however, not the case.  ","2682":"The fact that business users need to accept the terms and conditions of a platform even if they are anticompetitive \/ unfair shows that this platform enjoys significant market power and that there is little multi-homing. There is no doubt for example that Apple and Amazon are digital gatekeepers because the users of their marketplace (the App Store) or the Amazon marketplace have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by these platforms.We think that the three competition concerns identified in 18.9 are spot on.  ","2683":"The problem news publishers face when dealing with digital gatekeepers is that they have to adapt to their terms and conditions even if they are highly unfavourable to them. As these gatekeepers are private regulators, you have no choice but to accept their rules, however anticompetitive\/unfair they may be.Yes, we believe that a special tool is needed to address the structural competition problems created by mega digital platforms.  ","2684":"As already explained in other sections of this questionnaire, Articles 101 and 102 TFEU may not be the adequate vehicles to address these problems because competition law investigations are facts-specific (and thus tend to be narrow in their scope, as well as in the remedies ultimately adopted) and competition law investigations take time. A tool that would allow the Commission to take a broader, market-wide view of the problems and adopt broader remedies is thus desirable.see our response to 19.1Structural competition problems can potentially arise in other sectors than the digital sector if these sectors share some of the features of the digital sector, e.g. the presence of gatekeepers. Thus, in theory, there is no reason why the New Competition Tool should be limited to digital markets only, except if extending the scope of this tool to other sectors threatened its existence.","2685":"For instance, news apps subject to Apple App Store unfair terms and conditions are left without protection as illustrated by the Commission press release opening an investigation against Apple. Commission prefers to focus on a \u201csafe\u201d vertical leveraging case rather than do something for exploited non-competitors.see our previous answers above pleasesee our previous answers above please","2686":"The new competition tool should be limited to a narrow scope in order to ensure close scrutiny of the systemic digital platforms that have the ability and incentive to deteriorate competition for their own advantage. Such a narrow scope would ensure the efficacy and efficiency of the new tool as the Commission would only focus on certain digital undertakings, targeting at best all competition problems before they damage the market, the consumers and fair competition.see aboveThe above proposals make sense, but \u2013 as the ACCC experience shows \u2013 the Commission should be under no illusion that voluntary codes of  conduct \/ best practices will achieve any result. The strategy of digital gatekeepers is one of obfuscation and opposition. ","2687":"The imposition of mandatory remedies subject to strict monitoring (or when monitoring is not possible structural remedies) is the right way to go.The Commission should be allowed to do all of the above as the type of remedies needed depends on the identified problem. The Commission should thus an important degree of flexibility when defining remedies.","2688":"It is important that new investigative powers are targeted at investigating abusive behaviour by global dominant platforms. It seems difficult to see how the Commission could address structural competition problems of the global platforms without enjoying appropriate investigative powers.see previous answers aboveIf deadlines are not binding they will not be complied with, in particular given the digital gatekeepers\u2019 strategy of obfuscation.While the ability to adopt interim measures belongs to the EU competition arsenal, they have been rarely used.

The discussions on the goals of competition policy were vocal from the very emergence of the idea of economic competition and remain intense these days too. Not engaging into philosophical investigations of the origins, nature and function of competition and on its interaction with other important societal values, it suffices to assume that the value of the competitive process can be protected and promoted not only via a radical non-interventionism but also by proactive, selective and non-axiomatic public interventions. This proposition consists of two interdependent components: (i) recognition of the proactive (on some occasions even selective), political role of regulators and (ii) de-axiomatisation of competition policy.  The shifting of competition policy away from the domain of (axiomatic, natural) the \u2018science\u2019 of neoclassical (and any mathematical) economics to the domain of politics is not a voluntary choice, but an emerging objective trend.  Recognition and articulation of such an approach allows a more flexible and non-orthodox enforcement of competition policy, enabling on one hand the fine-tuning of regulatory responses to the broader political needs of the global digital race, while not abandoning on the other hand the principles and foundations of competition policy.The objective economic aim to establish closed, complete ecosystems (the trend is more visible in some Chinese digital markets).Depending how you perceive competition policy. From the traditional ex-post perspective it is often not a problem. From the perspective of competition policy sensu lato \u2013 it is the core of the problem.Categorically yes. Competition policy is inherently political. If there are objective needs to intervene, the new law should be adopted or the existing law\/theories should be interpreted accordingly. For legal theory this is a normal functioning of the legal matrix.Yes but. Only ex ante + ex post tools going hand in hand can work in the right way. The main theoretical challenge is to de-axiomatise competition policy. It has to be re-interpreted in accordance with the new reality. Competition policy is not about microeconomics, and its holistic obedience to microeconomic toolkits simplify the very nature of competition policy. \nAll the data economy is being driven by this trend. ","2691":"Because the area of the digital economy is very dynamic and transforming, regulators must often deal with the problems caused by the events and preconditions allowed a long time ago and planned even beforehand. The pathway from the opportunity identified and then exploited by a leading industry player to its comprehension and a meaningful regulatory response is very long \u2013 particularly for such rapidly changing circumstances. So, the strategic planning of the industry leaders is always ahead of regulators. Adding to this formula Big Tech\u2019s ability to channel the discussion and set up the most suitable narrative, it becomes clear that most of the challenges considered by regulators today are the opportunities utilised effectively by the industry leaders yesterday, and that most of the opportunities which are being utilised by them today will become the topics of the broader regulatory scrutiny only tomorrow. If Big Tech compete for the markets considering competition in the markets as \u2018competition for losers\u2019, all the negative regulatory implications experienced after the markets are taken over are simply signed off as costs. Regulators here face a Sisyphean task: however fast and proactive the steps are, they end up running after their own shadow.The examples are ubiquitous. This conduct is in the business DNA, this is a normal, rational conduct and desire of each company. The task of regulatory is not to prohibit it as such but to tame, domesticate, cultivate and channel.As aboveI'm not sure the question \"does anti-competitive monopolisation raise competition concerns\" is not tautological.Competition policy today is at a crossroad, the crossroad between the avenue attempting to comprehend the incomprehensible, squeezing the ever-complex and challenging reality into the ever-complex mathematical equilibrium by ever-sophisticated disciplinary toolkits (modernist competition policy), and the avenue shaping the argument for a need of the revision of the normative foundations and methodological apparatus of competition policy (postmodern competition policy). Modernism encapsulates the beliefs in the omnipotence of human mind to comprehend, classify, categorise, predict and manage the reality. Modernism is inherently encyclopaedic. It is about the triumph of ratio. Unlike modernist theories, postmodernism is inherently non-scientific. It does not have the inquisitorial ambition to discover the truth or to comprehend the reality implying that it is a futile endeavour as both are too complex, moving and fragmented. Different versions\/interpretations of facts and truths compete with each other and selecting one does not (necessarily) negate the validity of others. It de-pathologizes inconsistencies and indeterminacies enabling genuine adversarial process between different versions of the truth. In fact, many mainstream legal philosophers (e.g. HLA Hart and Ronald Dworkin) and non-neoclassical economists (e.g. Friedrich Hayek) while not labelling themselves post- or anti-modernists explicitly have confronted successfully the reductionist modernist legal and economic theories paving the way to such non-prescriptive, analytical postmodernism in law and in economics\u2019.In my research I argue that competition policy should not be artificially divided into ex ante and ex post. Of course, these approaches have different pedigrees and methodology, and the enforcers have very different competences in applying them. But inherently, they must be used as two arms of the same competition policy sensu lato. If Art 102 TFEU is not sufficient to address a specific problem, a sector-specific remedy should be considered. But overall, it is clear that the main regulatory power of the EU competition authorities is not in (reactive) ex-ante sector specific rules, which are easy to adapt to, but in ex-post competition rules. The latter are inherently vague and are open to interpretation. Their relative indeterminacy and multi-functionality allow much wider room for a proactive regulatory approach...","2692":"Another interesting question in this respect is the meaning of the term \"tacit\" in the algorithmic context. Can algorithms coordinate tacitly at all if all their steps are preprogrammed? If yes \u2013 should they ever have to engage into collusion sensu stricto if anything they do can be explained by some objective market rationality? It could be a zero-sum syllogism.One of the most important specificities of the global digital race is a zero-price nature of most of the multi-sided data-driven markets, which, among other things, implies that consumers are usually not particularly interested in protection of their data (privacy paradox) or in the nationality of the platform, which provides the digital services as long as the services are provided (or presumed to be provided) at the highest level. This inter alia implies the unsuitability of such (highly discredited but still dominant) microeconomic metrics as \u2018consumer welfare\u2019 in the ex-post competition law analysis. All forms of efficiency and welfare can be easily demonstrated in most of the problematic practices of Big Tech companies. One does not need to engage in advanced econometric analysis to prove that the main reason why Big Tech show such an exponential growth is because they generate, channel and deliver a lion share of the added value created by the emergence of the digital economy and the digital society more generally \u2013 or, in other words, because they are efficient and contribute significantly to any imaginable incarnation of consumer welfare. Big Tech companies are efficient. The marathon distance from the garages to the top of the world rankings of the companies with highest market capitalisation has been covered by them with the sprinter\u2019s speed precisely due to their multidimensional efficiency. \nSo it would be really difficult to limit the regulatory toolkit exclusively to ex-post competition apparatus with its traditional consumer welfare\/efficiency metrics. Less orthodox, more innovative theories of harm (or rather justifications for regulatory intervention) are needed.....As above.The basic characteristics of the digital economy indicate that it is embedded in and predetermined by the features of market tipping and network effects, competition for the markets and winner takes all. This implies that the dominance of the current digital incumbents will be increasing and that the probability of significant structural changes remains rather hypothetical. In addition to these objective trends there is a tendency in many jurisdictions to explore closer the links between industrial and competition policies or advocating a strong separation between the two policies if the status quo is beneficial for companies originating from such jurisdictions. Neither of the two scenarios reflect the interests of EU\/UK as both jurisdictions are net-contributors to the markets: EU\/UK consumers pay with their data and attention to mainly non-EU\/UK content and application providers, which then process the data and offer to those consumers narrowly-targeted advertising mainly from non-EU\/UK advertisers and pay only a tiny fraction of taxes generated on EU\/UK markets. Such a closed model allows big to become bigger marginalising the rest. This established online business reality requires a regulatory response. The shift to a more proactive, creative, selective and curated competition policy, reflecting the needs of adopting to the challenges raised and opportunities offered by the digital economy is a realistic and reasonable move..See above.It would be legitimate to ask what regulatory steps have to be taken by the EU\/UK authorities to make these polities (even) more competitive in the global digital race. The race, among other things, is conditioned by the winner-takes-most \/ zero-sum context, which explains the politisation and polarisation of the positions of the main actors. Supposedly, the potential of the EU\/UK is much higher than their current place in the race: not least due to their strong scientific foundations and developed institutions, but mainly due to a significant discrepancy in terms of the data (qua-oil\/currency) being permanently extracted from rich and law-abiding European\/UK consumers vis-\u00e0-vis revenues\/taxes landed in public purses of the non-EU\/UK jurisdictions.Only in tandem with ex-ante tools.Digital consumers are lazy, and the illusionary feeling that \"competition\", \"alternative\", \"more important digital activity\" is click away does the trick by reducing consumers' incentives to shop around. This is a distinctive feature of homo digitalis and the role of gatekeepers (we can call them curators or facilitators) is unavoidable.","2693":"..This must be the core objective of the digital competition policy. Of course, \"intervening\" does not means to direct or steer, but having a tool for a meaningful intervention is a must. Otherwise, an effective and up-to-date competition policy becomes an oxymoron.As aboveIn principle, all markets can have structural problems. Mainly, digital.","2694":"Non of the current competition tools if taken separately is capable to address today's structural problems. The rules are designed for different purposes \u2013 or at least the dominant microeconomic\/axiomatic interpretation of the rules is designed for different, static purposes. Only if applied with a clear political vision and in conjunction with ex-ante instruments, they can bring some meaningful changes. Otherwise, the mouth catching the cat game will continue its Sisyphean performance..as above..This appears to be one of the most workable, flexible, quick and thus suitable approaches to the gatekeeping problem.","2695":"In our view, none of the aspects listed above will on its own create structural competition problems, but rather the interaction between some of them. Some are more relevant for market results, others are of lesser relevance. This fact is clearly demonstrated by recent dominance abuse decisions in the digital sector (cf. the EU Commission\u2019s decisions in Google Shopping, case AT.39740, para. 271 et seqq; Google Android, case AT.40099, para. 431 et seqq.; as well as the German FCO\u2019s Facebook decision, case B6-22\/16, para. 422 et seqq.).\nThe often oligopolistic, or even duopolistic, market structures in digital markets may lead to reduced levels of competition due to the limiting factors in oligopolistic rivalry (Reaktionsverbundenheit). However, oligopolistic market structures alone do not allow to draw this conclusion (see the 4-to-3 mobile telecoms mergers, see the recent CFI statement in Hutchison\/Telefonica, case T?399\/16, para. 97: \u201c(\u2026) that the mere effect of reducing competitive pressure on the remaining competitors is not, in principle, sufficient in itself to demonstrate a significant impediment to effective competition (\u2026)\u201d).\nRather, in digital markets, it is typically the combination of narrow market structures with substantial barriers to entry which may dampen competition (see German Monopolies Commission, XXIII. Biennial Report (2020), \u201cMonopolies Commission (2020)\u201d, para. 52 et seqq.). For example, the European Commission, in its Google Shopping decision (case AT.39740 para. 287) qualified the control of large volumes of data, combined with network effects, and the ability to leverage existing market dominance into neighboring markets, as market conditions substantially contributing to entry barriers. Further market conditions typically ascribed to the digital sector are extreme economies of scale and scope, rapid growth, frequent market tipping by first-movers (aided by single-homing), gatekeeping and rule-making by market leading platforms (leaving little competition \u201con the market\u201d), platform control of entire ecosystems, information asymmetries - and on the positive side strong innovation dynamics, competition \u201cfor the market\u201d triggered by the entry of new technologies, and consumer benefits based on zero-pricing (see the German Federal Ministry of Economics, Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019, Report, 2019 (\u201cCommission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019)\u201d) p. 13 et seq.; UK Government, Unlocking digital competition, Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel, 2019, \u201cFurman Report (2019)\u201d, p. 17-40). For a more detailed discussion we refer, inter alia, to the questions below at 16.4, 18.4, and 23.1. \nBy contrast, as indicated by our rating in the table, significant financial strength (O), the fact that zero-pricing markets are concerned (P), or the application of pricing-algorithms (R) will in our view not create structural risks or even a structural lack of competition. The first element is not directly related to structural competition problems as there is no economic evidence supporting this assumption (see DoJ, https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/atr\/legacy\/2015\/01\/26\/9550.pdf, p. 15). The fact that there is no monetary price for a product or service simply indicates that monetisation shifts to another market side and or non-monetary goods, typically data (see also Google Shopping, case AT.39740 para. 319 et seqq.; see also the Facebook case, cited above), which means that the analysis of market definition needs to employ other means (replacing the SSNIP test, for example, by analysing user reactions to a small but significant non-transitory decrease in quality (SSNDQ), see Mandrescu, D., The SSNIP test and zero-pricing strategies: Considerations for online platforms, CoRe (2018) 2(4), 244-257). Finally, pricing algorithms afford their users a faster adaptation to changing market conditions, without necessarily creating structural competition problems. We elaborate below in replying to questions 14.4, 15.1 and 15.3.\nThe main question that needs to be answered is whether a new \u201cad hoc\u201d interventionist regime (the proposed New Competition Tool\/\u201cNCT\u201d) is the right approach, and can be introduced without defeating its own purpose of upholding competition, or whether ex-ante regulation is the better avenue, and will suffice, to solve structural problems in the digital sector. We advocate the second approach as we set out in more detail below (in particular in the last section from Question 24 onwards).Re the 1st element: In our view, structural competition problems cannot arise from the mere fact that an undertaking expands its business activities from its initial to a related market, if it is not in a dominant position on its home market. Moving into additional markets may be a sign of innovation, e.g. when mobile phone makers started adding cameras (which has over time disadvantaged digital camera makers). This may be different if a market dominant position is leveraged onto a second market by anti-competitive means, e.g. bundling or tying, margin squeeze etc., in order to foreclose competitors on that second market. These scenarios are already addressed by the existing rules (see also Monopolies Commission (2020), para. 81).\nRe the 2nd element: While structural competition problems may obviously arise in monopolistic markets, the described scenario is, in our opinion, not an expression of a structural competition deficit but of a lack of effective enforcement. When a dominant undertaking does not compete on the merits (leistungsfremder Wettbewerb) but hinders market entry or expansion by competitors, even extracts an unfair monopoly rent, abusive behaviour should be pursued by the competition authorities, or \u2013 if this is prevalent in a sector \u2013 sector regulation should be enacted. If by contrast, the behaviour issues from a non-dominant company, a \u201cmonopolisation\u201d theory of harm (indicating a potential future monopolist) would not meet the test of either Art 101 or 102 TFEU and would seriously undermine the very goal of market economies, namely competition for the most customers or sales, by offering the best price, highest quality and product innovation. There are no clear boundaries for distinguishing pro-competitive behaviour from anti-competitive behaviour below the market dominance threshold, nor good from bad growth.\nRe the 3rd element: A reduced number of players in the market may lead to parallel market behaviour without the need for anti-competitive coordination (a well-known result in oligopolistic markets, see below at 11.2, and Green, E., Marshall, R., & Marx, L. (2014), Tacit Collusion in Oligopoly, The Oxford Handbook of International Antitrust Economics, Vol. 2, Chapter 19) and may discourage maverick activity. Actual coordination between undertakings, by contrast, depends on additional elements, such in particular market transparency, market entry barriers, and the possibility to deter deviating behaviour (see General Court in re Airtours, T-342\/99). \nRe the 4th element: As indicated in our explanatory notes to question 6, we see algorithm pricing as a tool to automate adaptation to changing market conditions in real time, which in itself cannot qualify as a structural competition problem. Where algorithms are employed as a means of price coordination, the existing rules should be able to deal with the resulting behavioural infringement. \nAddressing the 5th element: Finally, markets which have tipped (a term that is not clearly defined) may count as markets with structural competition problems. Such markets will be challenged in due course, as a matter of \u201ccompetition for the market\u201d, but an ex-ante regulation may be chosen in order to revive competition, if the time horizon for a challenge appears too long and market outcomes in the meantime unacceptable. Such sector regulation could in particular seek to re-introduce contestability of the relevant market by data portability for users and interoperability for complementary services (cf. Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 54 et seq). -- Gatekeeper scenarios may be prone to tipping if platforms act as so-called \u2018unavoidable trading partner\u2019 between two market sides and multi-homing does not take place (Spiecker, Digitale Mobilit\u00e4t: Plattform Governance, GRUR 2019, 342). There is ample evidence for strong innovation dynamics having led to the fall of internet platforms: In Germany the search engine Altavista was replaced by Yahoo! and Yahoo! by Google. Regarding social networks Facebook has replaced MySpace and StudiVZ (Immenga\/Mestm\u00e4cker\/K\u00f6rber, competition law, Art. 2 ECMR, recital 24), Procato was replaced by Amazon Business. (https:\/\/t3n.de\/news\/b2b-procurement-779549\/). Similar \u201ccompetition for the market\u201d took place in network industries: traditional phone service providers (including the incumbents) in the retail supply of fixed telephone services and fixed internet access services markets were challenged by the market entries of TV cable networks (see the merger clearance, with remedies, Vodafone\/Liberty Global, COMP\/M.8864). In these markets, sectoral regulation helped to overcome incumbent market power.Dominant undertakings will frequently seek to export entrenched market positions to adjacent markets or develop entirely new offerings (markets), especially where the existing platform allows such leveraging by addressing the same user groups (consumers, online advertisers etc.). Typically, the markets concerned are subject to substantial entry barriers based on network effects and on substantial economies of scale and scope. Examples are Microsoft moving from the Windows OS into middleware and application software markets, search engine moving into browser markets etc. This does not constitute a problem as long as the new markets remain accessible to third parties (i.e. contestable) and no anti-competitive means are employed to foreclose that competition (see also our answers to questions 10.2, 18.4, an 18.8 below).","2696":"In principle, we do not consider it as a structural competition problem when a company with market power (without being dominant) tries to export its market position to related (or new) markets. As already discussed in question 7.1, such a market behaviour demonstrates the ability to innovate; as a business strategy it may provide first-mover advantages and\/or economies of scale and scope. ","2697":"In our view, preventing a strong, but non-dominant, market player from entering adjacent markets risks to undermine the competitive process, namely its innovation function. If there are nevertheless overriding reasons to prevent leveraging by non-dominant companies, which in effect would require separation of market activities (similar to rules applicable in the telecoms and energy markets), such a rule should not be imposed by an ad hoc intervention (i.e. a decision, even if without incriminating effect), but instead become part of a long-term sector regulation. As stated above, where a dominant undertaking exports its position by anti-competitive means, this must be stopped to keep markets open. We are sceptical that the same effect can result from the actions of an undertaking with \u201csome degree of market power\u201d. Such a lose test for allowing an intervention creates a threshold problem, therefore legal uncertainty, and accordingly barriers to growth and innovation. Competition law needs to act as a dependable regulatory framework (Ordnungsrahmen) which undertakings can rely on (and need to comply with) to design their business strategies.","2698":"Taking this perspective, in our view, the instruments provided under Article 102 TFEU are sufficient to address leverage by anti-competitive strategies. We will elaborate on this in our answer to question 9.3 below.As we have explained in our answer to question 9.2, there are situations where leveraging a dominant market position can amount to a restraint of competition, namely if it effectively forecloses competition on the second market. In our view, the foreclosure problem is sufficiently addressed under Article 102 TFEU (Mestm\u00e4cker\/Schweitzer, European Competition Law, chapter 4, \u00a7 18, para. 28; for an example from the case practice see COMP\/M.3304 - GE\/Amersham, para. 31). Enforcement has expanded to the digital sector (see the case against Microsoft in re Windows Media Player, T-201\/04: the Commission found Microsoft to have leveraged its position on the OS market into the market for media players by pre-installing the media player together with its Windows software, a case of tying\/bundling). The more recent Google cases, Shopping and Android, are further examples of the Commission\u2019s enforcement against leveraging strategies (by self-preferencing and exclusivity payments), although still subject to court review.","2699":"In our opinion, the active enforcement of Art 102 TFEU produces a sufficient level of deterrence. In addition, the correct market definition may help to frame the problem: Where an undertaking controls an indispensable input for accessing an up- or downstream market, it may be appropriate to apply a narrower market definition for the access market and, accordingly, to consider the respective undertaking as dominant (cf. e.g. the FCO\u2019s Scandilines decision of 27.01.2010, B9-188\/05, p. 30; re the market definition point, see the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 31 et seqq.).\nThe question whether ex-post enforcement provides a sufficient level of protection also in the digital sector, has nevertheless been raised (cf. Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 50 et seq.). If ex-post enforcement is seen as too slow, interim measures can be used (see below, 35.1). The interim measures imposing on Broadcom an obligation to cease and desist the use of certain contractual provisions until a final decision on the merits is taken (valid for a maximum period of 3 years) provide an example of such, to-date rarely used, powers (EU Commission, case AT.40608, press release IP\/19\/6109 of 16 Oct. 2019).","2700":"By contrast, spare resources should not be fielded as a valid argument; resources could be added. This applies to the NCAs under the effet utile principle (see ECJ, C-326\/88 - Hansen, para. 17; see also Articles 6 to 13 ECN+ Directive (EU) 2019\/1) and should apply to the  European Commission as well.We understand the term \u201canti-competitive monopolisation\u201d to refer to the rule-making character of platforms, or other \u201cnon-desirable\u201d market behaviour, although this is not clearly stated. Where platforms are dominant, this behaviour would be within the scope of Art 102 TFEU. Where they are not dominant, unfair business practices will be subject to the laws against unfair trade practices (UWG in Germany) and may in Germany be investigated by the FCO\u2019s new powers of a consumer protection related sector investigation (\u00a7 32e Abs. 5 GWB). We are not aware of incidences where neither of these sets of rules was available to curb such behaviour. On the contrary, the FCO did investigate Amazon\u2019s unfair rule-making regarding agreements with third-party sellers for the Amazon marketplace and achieved improved terms, applicable globally (see press release and case report of 17 July 2019, B2-88\/18). Should \u201cunfair\u201d rule-making behavior not be caught by Art 102 TFEU, there are arguably competitors in place to which platform users can turn if they wish to trade under different (better) terms of business.not applicable","2701":"Given the existence of relevant national laws, we do not think that there is a need for the European Commission to gain additional powers in order to intervene against unfair business practices. From our point of view, an appropriate level of protection can be secured by national authorities and national courts. If the European Commission sees a need for more of a level playing field regarding the regulation of unfair trade practices, the European Commission could issue (additional) internal market directives, following the earlier Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. ","2702":"Besides, a number of directives \/ regulations have already been issued which regulate business practices in the digital sector, both B2B and B2C (such as the Directive (EU) 2019\/770 regulating certain aspects of contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services and the Directive (EU) 2002\/58\/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector). And the Commission has published plans to issue further ex-ante regulations governing digital markets (see Press release IP\/20\/962 of 2 June 2020 on launching the consultation to seek views on the Digital Services Act package). There is no need for a new competition tool, in addition.","2703":"Markets in which undertakings depend for their business activities on infrastructure that cannot, or at least not without unreasonable effort, be duplicated. This applies to network based industries such as a railroad network or a mobile network. In both cases, access is a pre-condition to do business in those markets and the initial establishment of such networks comes with substantial sunk cost and regulatory barriers. Thus, at the infrastructure level (i.e. excluding MVNO), and often at the wholesale level as well, those markets tend to be oligopolistic. ","2704":"Certain digital markets are equally concentrated, however, such market positions have not developed based on infrastructure, but rather follow a first-mover advantage and possibly, in platform markets, markets tend to tip towards the platform with the largest user base (\u201cwinner takes most\u201d). (See Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p 49).The risk of tacit collusion is, to our understanding, most common on markets which are transparent and lack competitive pressure from the outside, due to barriers to entry (e.g. high sunk costs, difficulty to replicate infrastructure, data, etc.) and customer inertia (based on switching costs, including lack of data portability, or lack of alternative offers).","2705":"We acknowledge that oligopolistic markets may show a lower level of effective competition than more fragmented markets with a higher number of active players (although as stated above at Question 6), this depends on a number of elements such as the possibility to anticipate competitor behaviour based on market transparency, market concentration and product homogeneity, as well as barriers to entry, see for another example ECJ, case C-413\/06 - P Sony\/BMG JV, where the ECJ rejected the idea that tacit collusion would occur on the recorded music market and the wholesale market for licences of online music). We, however, do not see a need for intervention below the benchmark for anticompetitive behaviour as defined by the provisions of Article 101 and in particular Article 102 TFEU.","2706":"From our point of view, it is, of course, appropriate for the European Commission, as well as for national competition authorities, to pay particular attention to oligopolistic markets if they present a high risk of anticompetitive behaviour (see Petit, N, The Oligopoly Problem in EU Competition Law, Research Handbook in European Competition Law (2013), p. 261 et seqq.). However, this does not, in our opinion, justify precautionary measures in addition to the instruments already available, e.g. sector investigations (cf. Monopolies Commission (2020), para. 121). Should the digital sector be considered to require additional rules to guard against parallelism (or tacit collusion) in oligopolies it will be important to create a framework of rules (Ordnungsrahmen) and can be relied on by undertakings for business creation and planning. We, therefore, disagree with the notion of ad hoc interventions into oligopolistic markets outside of Art 101\/102 TFEU, but strongly propose to adopt ex ante sector regulation, if the EU Commission sees a need to curb coordinated effects in oligopolistic market structures. ","2707":"Moreover, asymmetric regulation could be applied to undertakings found to have significant market power (as has been the case in the telecoms sector regulation, sec. 19-21 TKG).  This approach has been proposed for the digital sector as well, namely by the Furman Report (2019), p. 41\/42, 55 (\u201cstrategic market status\u201d) and the 10th amendment bill for the German Antitrust Act (\u201cparamount cross-market significance\u201d\/ \u201c\u00fcberragende markt\u00fcbergreifende Bedeutung\u201d, cf. the proposed \u00a7 19a GWB, Referentenentwurf of 24 January 2020). This approach allows to fashion specific rules for oligopolistic markets subject to a structural risk, without jettisoning legal certainty; and the regulatory onus would be based on a prior market investigation and imposed for a limited time only.B2B and B2C digital market platforms.We have presented our position in our answer to question 13.1 above. To reiterate briefly, we do consider that Articles 101, 102 TFEU provide sufficient power for the European Commission, and\/or the respective national competition authorities, to address such oligopolistic markets. In addition, sector regulation may be added which could lower the threshold for interim measures and could address certain rules to undertakings with \u201csignificant market power\u201d (see above).Pricing algorithms can automate the adaptation of prices to changing market conditions, in particular price competition from third parties. In order to work, competitor pricing needs to be transparent and pricing to customers must be adjustable in very short cycles. To-date, authorities have prevented the risk of price alignment via price algorithms by requiring a layout of transaction platforms which avoids \u201csuper transparency\u201d by ring fencing transactions from competitors\u2019 (algorithmic) eyes and by raising thresholds for platform access which diminishes transparency. By way of example, the German FCO assessed the B2B trading platform for steel products operated by XOM Metals GmbH (27 March 2018, case B5-1\/18-001) requiring the implementation of measures preventing platform users from deriving competitively sensitive (i.e. price offers or transactional price) information. ","2708":"At the same time, pricing algorithms may also be relevant on non-platform markets. The European Commission has recently fined four producers for implementing such vertical restraints (cases COMP\/AT.40465 Asus, COMP\/AT.40469 Denon & Marantz, COMP\/AT.40181 Philips, and COMP\/AT.40182 Pioneer). In all four cases, the producers used, internal and external, price crawlers in order to monitor the resale pricing of their distributors.","2709":"The use of algorithms and their relevance for competition law enforcement has recently been investigated by the German and French competition law authorities as well (see German Federal Cartel Office and French Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence, working paper \u201cAlgorithms and Competition\u201d, November 2019). This study identifies potential risks for competition law infringements with the help of algorithms, namely the initiation of collusion and the implementation of collusion, via third parties, and directly between competitors, and discusses enforcement measures prohibiting such algorithmic collusion (p. 26 et seqq.).Concerns may exist where B2B or B2C transactional platforms are also active up-\/downstream and therefore compete with platform users.Please refer to the discussion above at 14.4.We do not see an increased need for the European Commission to be able to intervene in markets in which pricing algorithms are used. Rather, the current level of intervention based on the application of Articles 101, 102 TFEU appears sufficient.","2710":"We arrive at this conclusion primarily based on the consideration that pricing algorithms change the speed of a market behaviour in response to changing conditions but not the behaviour itself. This means, the same business conduct, i.e. following publicly available price setting decisions by competitors, could be adopted without using algorithms. The ECJ\u2019s decision in re Eturas (case C?74\/14) can serve as an example: the system administrator of a cloud-based booking software had announced a standard limitation applicable to discounts offered by the travel agencies connected via this platform; the fact that these travel agencies had not objected to this discount limitation, was considered an illicit price coordination.","2711":"We are, further, unconvinced that algorithmic pricing needs to be addressed by additional ex-ante regulation. The use of algorithms may reduce the disadvantages of smaller enterprises allowing them to implement a system of fast reactions to changing market conditions at lesser cost (see: German Federal Cartel Office and French Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence, working paper \u201cAlgorithms and Competition\u201d, November 2019, p. 1). On the contrary, competitive and transparent online markets facilitate the allocative function of competition: they reduce search costs (the lower price is just one click away), leave consumers better informed and create downward pressure on prices (G\u00f6hsl, Algorithm Pricing and Article 101 TFEU, WuW 2018, 123; Salaschek\/Serafimova, Preissetzungsalgorithmen im Lichte von Art. 102 AEUV, WuW 2019, 118).As already indicated in our answer to question 15.1, we consider that Articles 101, 102 TFEU provide a sufficient level of protection for competition as regards the use of algorithmic pricing. ","2712":"In general, we would expect Articles 101, 102 TFEU to apply to pricing algorithms in the same way as those provisions have been applied to pricing decisions so far. We acknowledge that there may be a risk of potential concealment but consider this as an issue which can be addressed by investigations, potentially adding resources to improve the authorities\u2019 ability to detect algorithms operating in the market (see Monopolies Commission (2020), para. 206 et seqq.).not applicableNetwork effects, whether direct or indirect effects, can cause a market to tip (see Schweitzer, H. et al., Modernisierung der Missbrauchsaufsicht f\u00fcr marktm\u00e4chtige Unternehmen, Endbericht, (29 August 2018), p 12). Network effects are a key feature of the platform economy (Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 16 et seq.). \nNetwork effects describe a scenario in which platform users benefit when their number increases, on the same market side (direct) or on another market side (indirect). If network effects are coupled with a lack of effective platform competition (e.g. due to single homing) this will favour market tipping (see FCO, case B6-57\/15 - Online-Dating-Plattform, para. 139 et seqq.). This type of development, however, occurs only in very specific market conditions (see Immenga\/Mestm\u00e4cker\/Thomas, Competition Law, \u00a7 36 para. 229), namely a first-mover effect, together with economies of scale which,  may facilitate market tipping as they reduce cost for the platform which has attracted most users, and raises costs for all rival platforms which may eventually exit the market. \nInnovation dynamics (new technologies superseding older ones, so called \u201ccompetition for the market\u201d) counter tipping tendencies and more generally contestability of markets. For example, Facebook as one of the first social networks is today challenged by a number of operators like Snapchat and TikTok. Those challengers offer a somewhat different type of service, but do replace Facebook, at least regarding the demand of certain (younger) user groups (see https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/02\/12\/facebook-is-losing-younger-users-to-snapchat-according-to-a-study.htm).\nHowever, the timeframe for innovation dynamics may be too long (see above at 7.1). To counteract strong network effects in the meantime, users must be empowered to multi-home, or at least to easily switch platforms, which in a B2C context requires user data portability, and in a B2B context potentially an open data standard. An introduction of such drastic steps would require substantial investment as well as standard setting by the industry and for these reasons will need to be enshrined in an ex-ante regulation for platforms in the digital sector (Furman Report (2019), p. 57)Please refer to our discussion at 16.4 above. In our view, tipping is a common occurrence in technology driven markets, be this digital technology or other technology.As in any market dominated by one or two players, competition concerns arise and enforcement will seek to ensure or revive market contestability. The goal must therefore be to keep such markets open from the start. For the digital sector, we believe the existing competition rules (Article 102 TFEU) and possibly additional ex-ante sector regulation could deal with scenarios where contestability appears to be at risk or the time horizon appears to be too long. In addition, we have proposed to study ex-ante sector regulation that secures contestability, via user data portability, and potentially open data standards (see above at 16.4 and below at 31.1).Even though we agree that tipping markets may cause competitive concerns, we do not agree with the assumption that ad hoc interventionist tools should be adopted to prevent markets from tipping. \nFirst, we are not convinced market tipping itself constitutes a problem which requires a novel approach. Instead, it is essential that the dominant position which has arisen does not remain unchallenged. In fact, there may still be enough potential for new competition in the market which would allow to still qualify such a market as effective (see Haucap, J and Heimeshoff, U, Google, Facebook, Amazon, eBay: Is the Internet driving competition or market?, DICE Discussion Paper No. 83, January 2013). There is clear evidence that dominant positions in digital markets will be attacked (see Guti\u00e9rrez, G. and Philippon, T., Fading Stars, NBER Working Paper No. 25529 (2019), who have analysed that \u201csuper-star firms\u201d, whose number, measured by their share of the input to overall productivity, has diminished in importance over the past 60 years in the US). This is even true in case of very strongly entrenched quasi monopolies: Google\u2019s otherwise dominant position in search has been successfully challenged by the Korean search engine Naver (see https:\/\/www.link-assistant.com\/blog\/google-vs-naver-why-cant-google-dominate-search-in-korea\/). \nSecond, to prevent tipping by intervention would require predicting the tipping action itself, the relevant player, and the means by which it would arrive there. In other words, to call for a proactive intervention against tipping means to replace the \u201cinvisible hand of the market\u201d (Adam Smith) by a regulator\u2019s foresight. This would mean to limit an undertaking\u2019s internal growth, which is the engine of market activity itself. The danger of false positives, resulting in harm to competition, rather than protection of competition, appears very high.\nThird, the dominant undertaking will still be subject to the restraints of Article 102 TFEU. Where necessary, additional ex-ante sector regulation should ensure contestability, and additional asymmetric rules for undertakings with \u201csignificant market power\u201d may be considered (see above at 13.1). It is then, however, the legislator which creates a level playing field for all market participants in the digital sector.","2713":"Gatekeeper scenarios may arise if platforms become an unavoidable trading partner for their users (the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 31\/32), and govern the terms and conditions under which their users may access or trade on the platform and may compete with the platform. This phenomenon has been discussed under the term platforms as \u201crule-makers\u201d or \u201cregulators\u201d (Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 49; EU Commission, Competition Policy for the Digital Era, (2019), Report, p. 60). The anti-competitive goal can be foreclosure of competitors, in platforms cases on a different market side than the one on which the platform is the gatekeeper, the pro-competitive goal the avoidance of free-riding (see M\u00fcKo-Eilsmansberger\/Bien, Art 102, 3d ed. 2020, para. 505). \nExamples are app stores on mobile operating systems (e.g. Apple\u2019s app store, see the Commission\u2019s press release of 16 June 2020 about opening an investigation into the app store rules) or the Amazon Marketplace (governed by Amazon\u2019s rules imposed on third-party vendors using Amazon Marketplace, which the FCO regarded as partially intransparent and unfair, see German Federal Cartel Office, decision of 17 July 2019, B2-88\/18; now followed by a separate EU Commission investigation, opened on the same date the FCO\u2019s was closed). These providers would not be dominant on a wider app store or marketplace market, unless market definition is reduced to the access market or platform they control. This was the position taken by the FCO in the Amazon case and equally by the German Federal Court in the adblocker case: adblockers control access to websites by their users through blocking ads, but also maintaining \u201cwhitelists\u201d if websites adhere to certain rules and pay for unblocking their services. The Court considered the adblocker dominant on the access market it created (decision of 8 October 2019, KZR 73\/17 - Werbeblocker III). Platforms may also control the conditions of competition by their users, on their own websites and third-party platforms (so-called price parity or most favoured nation clauses, investigated in the series of booking.com cases by the German, the UK, the French, Italian and Swedish authorities; the German case ended with the Appellate Court\u2019s decision allowing narrow MFNs, OLG D\u00fcsseldorf, Urt. v. 4.6.2019 \u2013 VI-Kart 2\/16 (V)).The term \u201cgatekeeper\u201d does not denote a clear legal concept, but is typically understood to mean a bottleneck or gateway position (or other input) which a company controls (see Furman Report (2019), p. 55 and 81). ","2714":"The issue in such cases can be the refusal to grant access altogether, or grant access only based on discriminatory or unfair conditions. If an undertaking controlling the input is dominant on its market, Article 102 TFEU provides remedies. The problem the EU Commission cites has to do with market definition: not in all cases are such gatekeeper undertakings dominant (unless markets are confined to the access market, see above). The Furman Report (2019), which focusses on the digital sector (titled \u201cUnlocking Digital Competiton\u201d), has therefore proposed a designation of relevant digital platforms to have \u201cstrategic market status\u201d, if they have \u201cenduring market power over a strategic bottleneck market\u201d, allowing a digital regulator to impose special obligations (p. 55, 81). See the discussion at 13.1 above related to this type of ex-ante regulation.Under the traditional essential facility doctrine, indispensability of the input, e.g. platform access, to compete in the market, is decisive, further the inability to substitute such input, or access by alternate, even if less advantageous, means, be this for legal or factual reasons (see, inter alia, ECJ, case C-7\/97 - Bronner; case C-418\/01 - IMS Health). When a company has attracted a substantive number of users to one side of a transaction platform, access to the platform may be \u2018indispensable\u2019 for users on the other market side in order to conduct their business, if they cannot switch to a substitute platform to reach the same users. Under the essential facilities doctrine, the input or access market must be dominated, while the number of users on the downstream market does not play any role \u2013 even the first offering on a new market, i.e. without a prior user base, would be within the scope of that doctrine (see IMS Health). \nThis should be the same for gatekeeping platforms: where the platform market is dominated, access must be granted, and on non-discriminatory terms.  Whether gatekeeping platforms can exist without being dominant, appears unclear. The solution may lie in concluding dominance, and requiring access, where users can be reached via that transactional platform alone, due to single-homing (similar to call termination on fixed or mobile telecom network), or users depend on the services of a non-transactional platform in the absence of a substitute.  A recent example for the latter type is provided by the German FCO\u2019s Facebook case which considered Facebook\u2019s terms regarding the use of off-Facebook user data as breaching GDPR and therefore abusive (see FCO, case B6-22\/16, confirmed by the German Federal Supreme Court, in preliminary proceedings, however as an exploitative abuse, see judgement of 23.06.2020, KVR 69\/19). For transactional platforms, a minimum number of users may therefore be a threshold issue.Please refer to our answer to question 18.8.In our opinion, the European Commission will be able to intervene in gatekeeper scenarios, if undertakings in gatekeeper positions are dominant. In case they are not (yet) dominant, because competing platforms exist, the definition of \u201cgatekeeper\u201d becomes a threshold question.","2715":"Concerns about market players in gatekeeping positions refusing to provide upstream input or access have been dealt with under the doctrine of refusal to deal (for input, Commercial solvents), the essential facilities doctrine (for infrastructure, German FCJ decision in re F\u00e4hrhafen Puttgarden, KVR 15\/01; ECJ, C-241\/91 \u2013 Magill and C-242\/91 -  IMS Health), the case law requiring FRAND licenses for standard-essential patents (ECJ, C-170\/13 - Huawei\/ZTE), and finally sector regulation with regard to infrastructure held by former state monopolies in the railroad, energy, postal and telecom services markets (see the reference in the Furman Report (2019) to the asymmetric telecoms regulation based on \u201csignificant market power\u201d, p. 81). \nIn early digital cases, interventions relied on the essential facilities doctrine, in order to force vertically integrated operators to grant access to their infrastructure, via interoperability information (Microsoft v Comm., T-201\/04 (2007); Andreangeli, A., Interoperability as an \"essential facility\" in the Microsoft case - encouraging competition or stifling innovation? (2009) European Law Review, 34(4), p. 585 et seqq.) More recently, the EU Commission has gone further and issued a prohibition of self-preferencing by a dominant platform (see the EU Commission\u2019s Google Shopping case, AT.39740) which is however a new theory of harm, not directly based on the traditional essential facility doctrine, and currently before the EU courts (see critical review by P.I. Colomo, Self-Preferencing: Yet Another Epithet in Need of Limiting Principles, 17 July 17 2020, available at SSRN).","2716":"The condition under which access must be provided by a dominant platform or other gatekeeper, is \u201cindispensability\u201d, i.e. that certain user groups \/ customers may not otherwise be reached. The access remedy in digital cases will usually require a change of technology or business model (as e.g. in Google Shopping). ","2717":"We are not convinced that non-dominant market players should be qualified as gatekeepers subject to onerous access rules. The access issue can (partly) be resolved by resorting to a market definition that defines access to consumers\/services\/data as a separate market under Article 102 TFEU (see the above-cited German Federal Court of Justice\u2019s Werbezeitblocker III case). Should this be considered insufficient, an ex-ante regulation may be needed to introduce a clear legal standard and avoid harming innovation competition \u2013 also in view of typically onerous \u201crestorative\u201d remedies.From our point of view, Article 102 TFEU provides sufficient powers to address gatekeeping situations. But please see our answer to question 19.1 above for a more measured approach.As we have explained above, for example in our answer to question 7., we consider that there are certain markets in which structural competition problems are more likely to occur. We have elaborated on the relevance of certain market characteristics especially in our answers to questions 6.1, 8.5, 13.1, 14.4, 16.4 and 18.4.\nFor completeness\u2019 sake, we add that special risks of structural competition problems predominantly exist on markets where business activities depend on the access to a certain input (data), platform or infrastructure, see at 18. and 19. above.","2718":"In our opinion, Article 101 TFEU is the right instrument to address structural competition problems that arise from coordinated market behaviour between undertakings. In fact, the decision practice has extended Art 101 TFEU far beyond traditional cartels including over time information exchange with regard to almost every market parameter and even signalling scenarios where the problems arise from artificial market transparency. This flexibility, which the courts have supported, should allow the Commission to deal with similar issues in the digital sector. In our best understanding, the scenarios discussed under the label \u201cstructural competition problems\u201d mainly address scenarios within the scope of Article 102 TFEU as they primarily refer to unilateral conduct. ","2719":"As explained above, i.a. in our answers to questions 17.1 and 17.3, the EU Commission is right in pushing to translate competition law enforcement to the digital age. As regards Article 101 TFEU this could mean, inter alia, to clarify the ultimate responsibility for algorithm activity as there are, for example, uncertainties about the scope of user tracking by digital platforms. Even though users agree to tracking in terms and conditions and are made aware of tracking by the mandated cookie consent on individual websites, the information harvested could potentially be used for covert price discrimination as well as more overt personalizing of offers. (Coyle, Antitrust Law Journal No. 3 (2019), Practical competition policy implications of digital platforms, p. 24 et seq.). Given the flexibility to-date, we are confident that this challenge can be overcome even, by issuing notices and guidelines, without introducing new competences and tools for the regulating agencies.Please see our answer to question 22.1 above.As discussed above, we consider that Article 102 TFEU provides sufficient powers and tools to effectively address structural problems (see at 9.1, 11.1, 13.1, 19.1 and 22.1). We do, however, also acknowledge that certain scenarios are not without risk for effective competition, in particular gatekeeper settings.\nIn order to properly address such scenarios using the powers provided under Article 102 TFEU, it is important to develop and apply market definitions which suit today\u2019s business environment as it has been shaped by the digitisation and take account of market power based on data access, \u201cunavoidable\u201d intermediation, and conglomerate positions across ecosystems (cf, e.g. Alexiadis, P and de Streel, A, Designing an EU Intervention Standard for Digital Platforms, EUI Working Paper RSCAS 2020\/14 (2020), p. 22 et seqq.; Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 28-32). Moreover, ex-ante sector regulation could introduce rules to support contestability of markets, namely user data portability and interoperability requirements. Whether special rules for undertakings with strategic (or paramount cross-) market power for not clearly dominant, but unavoidable trading partner platforms with gatekeeper function, should be introduced will require more thorough examination (see the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 32\/33; see above at 19.1).\nIn EU competition law, self-preferencing behaviour has been adequately covered by Article 102 TFEU. However, this case group presupposes the existence of a dominant position on one of the markets affected by the conduct. (ECJ, C-7\/97 \u2013 Bronner).  Furthermore indispensability is  necessary when the lawfulness of a given practice is assessed (see P. I. Colomo, Self-Preferencing: Yet Another Epithet in Need of Limiting Principles,17 July 2020, SSRN, p. 36; ECJ, C-418\/01 - IMS Health; ECJ, T-65\/98 \u2013 Van den Bergh Foods). \nIn our opinion these strict criteria for proactive measures are necessary as they may come with unintended and unpredictable consequences. European authorities have taken proactive measures pursuant to Article 102 TFEU in cases of self-preferencing, e. g. in Google Android (EU-Com., Case AT.40099 - Google Android) where the Commission concluded that Google\u2019s commercial practice forces business partners to make use of multiple Google services. In Google Shopping (EU-Com, Case AT.39740 \u2013 Google Shopping), the European Commission appears to have adopted a lower burden of proof compared with traditional refusal to deal\/essential facility cases but rather adopted a different approach which is more in line with leveraging cases (tying, bundling, margin squeeze) and avoided the need to directly address the issue of indispensability. Also the Commission has opened investigations against Amazon and Apple for practices that were deemed to favour their activities at one level of the value chain (EU-Com, 16.07.2019, IP\/19\/4291; EU-Com, 16.06.2020, IP\/20\/1073; EU-Com, 16.06.2020, IP\/20\/1075).As we have especially identified gatekeeping scenarios as potentially problematic, we would like to refer to our answer to question 18.4 above.We generally consider the existing toolbox, i.e. Articles 101, 102 TFEU as sufficient. Even though we acknowledge that new developments, and the digitisation in particular, produce new challenges for regulatory authorities, it is our understanding that certain adaptions in the way the existing rules are applied would bring a sufficient level of protection for effective competition. \nAlso, we would like to point out that a new tool relying on predictions of market developments, in particular market tipping, appears difficult to square with the overall approach of competition law operating as a regulatory framework. We do not believe that market outcomes can be predicted with any degree of certainty, certainly to such a degree that remedial measures could be imposed on companies before any abuse in the traditional sense has actually taken place. Moreover, an assessment and regulatory action taken based on \u2018desirable market outcomes\u2019 might open the gates to political \ninfluence on competition law enforcement. To-date, EU competition practice has avoided politics interfering with competition law enforcement which has done the European internal market a great service \u2013 traditions across member states are too diverse to agree on the right steering. \nFirst of all, the development of a decision practice particular to the digital sector is in full swing and it would appear wise to await the outcomes, including judicial review, of a number of cases before undertaking a paradigm change by installing a new threshold of intervention below market dominance.\nBeyond that, a phased approach would seem warranted, namely updating the market definition notice, and the Commission\u2019s guidance on its enforcement priorities under Art 102 TFEU by adding chapters on digital markets (see the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 51 et seq.). Furthermore studies could be undertaken to prepare ex-ante sector regulation with a view to ensuring contestability of markets (cf. Coyle, Antitrust Law Journal No. 3 (2019), Practical competition policy implications of digital platforms, p. 23 et seqq.) and to better understand leveraging strategies and available remedial action, as advocated by the Furman Report (2019) (retrospective evaluation into enforcement against dominance abuse, p. 103) and the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 Report (2019) (evaluation cross-market foreclosure strategies, p. 32\/33, and remedial actions, p. 77-79). After all there is ample experience with sector regulation in Europe. If it appears necessary to create an interventionist regime for non-dominant gatekeeper positions, the UK or German path of designing a \u201cstrategic market status\u201d could be followed which would offer more legal certainty than the contemplated \u201cNCT\u201c by (i) defining the conditions for such an asymmetric declaratory status and (ii) enumerating the \u201cremedies\u201d which may be imposed (see the most recent Guidelines, 2018\/C 159\/01, which detail market definition, para. 24 et seq.,","2720":"As explained above, we do not consider the introduction of a new competition tool warranted at this time. If such a tool should be introduced nevertheless, we would emphasise that such an instrument should take the form of an ex-ante regulation proper, which addresses market dominant platforms, or at most platforms with a \u201cstrategic market status\u201d (or similar), to be closely defined and with an enumerated list of remedies (see above at Question 24.1). ","2721":"Moreover, we fail to see a valid legal basis for the introduction of a new competition tool which would rely on a lower threshold than a dominant position. The enabling rule in primary law, Article 103 TFEU, can only be used for regulations or directives that \u201cgive effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU\u201d. Accordingly, the requirements for application of a potential new competition tool would have to be based on the same requirements, for the purposes here on the conditions for application of Article 102 TFEU. By way of example, the German Monopolies Commission supports the EU Commission\u2019s proposal to add ex-ante regulation of market dominant platforms, e.g. to prohibit self-preferencing (Monopolies Commission (2020), p. 38 et seqq., para. 85, 90 et seqq.). See above at (22.1, 23.1).","2722":"According to the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy, only market-dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that their conduct does not further impair the remaining competition and accordingly new rules of conduct should apply to all platforms which are market-dominant (Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 53.). The Furman Report (2019), on the other hand, has proposed that platforms with \"strategic market status\" should be subject to special regulatory rules of conduct, thus linking regulation to an independent regulatory concept of market power. The special rules of conduct would then only apply to those platforms whose addressees are determined in a separate procedure (Furman Report (2019), p. 58 et seqq.).Applicable to the digital sector only.","2723":"As pointed out before, we generally do not support a new competition tool in terms of an ad hoc regulatory tool. \nIf such a tool would be introduced nevertheless, it should be applicable exclusively to the digital sector, and within that, to defined scenarios, in particular market dominant gatekeeper platforms, or at most platforms that carry a \u201cstrategic market status\u201d, e.g. with regard to their rule-making nature across an entire ecosystem (\u201cparamount cross-market significance\u201d, see the proposed \u00a7 19a in the Germany\u2019s 10th amendment bill to the German Antitrust Act).","2724":"We refer to our answer to question 28.1.While we do not advocate the introduction of an interventionist \u201cNCT\u201d we have recommended the introduction of notices\/guidelines that deal with market definition and market dominance criteria as well as application of Art 102 TFEU to the digital sector. The Furman Report (2019) (p. 58\/59) has instead proposed the establishment of a code of conduct for digital platforms, in liaison with digital sector industry and stakeholders, a type of \u201csoft law\u201d which has to-date not been used in EU Commission practice.As explained in our answers to several questions above, we do not consider the introduction of a new competition tool warranted at this (early) stage. Therefore, we discuss below only measures based on the current rules, i.e. remedies imposed under Article 102 TFEU. ","2725":"Under Article 102 TFEU, the European Commission may impose behavioural (non-structural) remedies. For example, it might order a dominant \u201cgatekeeper\u201d platform to grant access to users, under non-discriminatory terms. If the EU courts condone a wider scope for cease-and-desist orders against self-preferencing behaviour under Article 102 TFEU, and even \u201crestorative remedies, or if a future ex-ante regulation prohibits self-preferencing in defined circumstances, these would, again, constitute behavioural (non-structural) remedies. ","2726":"The German Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 has advised that in markets where strong and rapid concentration tendencies require rapid action against anti-competitive behaviour by dominant companies, a transition to clear, relatively simple rules of conduct make sense because they can give the market clear signals on the \"rules of the game\" and can simplify and speed up the application of the law. Other measures such as the obligation of market-dominant companies to grant access to data, are currently not suitable for a transition to simple generalizing rules of conduct in the view of the the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019: The constellations of facts are too diverse and the effects on competition too complex. (Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 25).","2727":"By contrast, structural remedies have been used in the telecoms and energy regulatory frameworks, namely accounting and ownership separation between networks and services. This was based on, i.a. the fact that the incumbents had enjoyed state monopolies and had funded their historic networks with taxpayer money. It is not clear, at this stage, that digital sector undertakings, and be it dominant platforms, even those controlling entire ecosystems, should be subjected to structural remedies. However, an ex-ante regulation demanding data portability, interoperability, and even open data rules, will come quite close to a structural remedy given that interoperability information and sharing of (non-personal) data accumulated over time will mean access to \u201ccrown jewels\u201d of these undertakings (see Microsoft\u2019s reaction to the CFI\u2019s 2007 decision T-201\/04 confirming the Commission\u2019s order to release of server interoperability information for Windows Server 2003, quoted from the Microsoft 2008 Annual Report: \u201cThe \u2026 impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate \u2026 (and) may enable competitiors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products\u201d, quoted from the Wikipedia article \u201cMicrosoft Corp. v. Commission\u201d).","2728":"As explained in our answer to question 31.1, we do not consider that structural remedies are an appropriate tool to address competition issues at this stage. The question is thus not relevant to us.In case a new competition tool would be introduced it would be of high importance that decisions taken under an ex-ante regulation as envisaged here are based on a full investigation, equally securing full rights of defence. As set out above (see at 24.1, 27.1 and 28.1) we propose to adopt a phased approach, namely (i) develop the decision practice under Art 102 TFEU in digital markets, (ii) publish guidelines on market definition, market dominance criteria and enforcement priorities in digital markets, (iii) run retroactive evaluation as proposed in the Furman Report (2019) as well as further cross-market leveraging and remedy studies as proposed in the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), before turning (iv) to adopting ex-ante sector regulation, including potentially a \u201cstrategic market status\u201d \/ \u201cparamount cross-market significance\u201d type of declaratory decision for special rules to apply below a clear dominant threshold.We have replied above based on current practice under Art 102 TFEU and a potential ex-ante regulation, to be adopted at a later stage, in order to subject dominant platforms to additional rules (e.g. a prohibition of self-preferencing). ","2729":"As explained in our answer to question 33.1 above, we consider that it would be important for the Commission to be able to make its decisions following a full investigation, and a full defence as well. The right to request information is a key instrument in order to gather the required information. ","2730":"The possibility to impose fines in cases of non-compliance would potentially be necessary in order to make the instrument effective. As false and misleading information could result in inaccurate assessments of market developments and, ultimately, could result in inadequate actions taken. Thus, there is a need for deterrence as regards such illicit behaviour, which could potentially be best achieved through the power to impose fines in cases of misconduct. The German Monopolies Commission has instead recommended tightening the procedural obligations for undertakings to cooperate with the Commission; if companies do not disclose certain information on their own initiative, the Commission should be allowed to draw conclusions from a lack of cooperation in the context of their free consideration of evidence. (Monopolies Commission (2020) p. 35).  This type of procedural rule, however, shifts the burden of proof and should therefore not be considered.","2731":"Rights to interview management and personnel should not be adopted beyond current rules. EU competition rules address undertakings, not individuals. They must accordingly be enforced against undertakings. The right to inspect undertakings premises and documents, in particular virtual documentation, should suffice\nInspections at the companies are a powerful tool to access confidential company information. However, this would apply to investigations of illicit behaviour only, i.e. suspected behaviour subject to Articles 101, 102 TFEU.In our view, ex-ante regulation once adopted should apply to dominant platforms, or at most, to those with \u201cstrategic market status\u201d\/\u201dparamount cross-market significance\u201d and in that case follow the two-step approach set out above, namely (1) defining conditions for such a declaratory decision, and (2) enumerating special rules. The declaratory decision should apply for a limited time only.Once ex-ante regulation of dominant (SMS) platforms would be introduced, we consider it appropriate, in line with current law, to include the power to impose interim measures. We note, however, that the EU Commission has so far adopted interim measures in extremely few cases (the first in 20 years was the recent Broadcom decision, press release IP\/19\/6109 of 16 October 2019), and accordingly has very limited experience. We therefore recommend to develop such practice under the existing rules (Art 102 TFEU\/Art 8 (1) Regulation 1\/2003) first before proposing to do the same under a new ex-ante regulation. There is  for the same reason no case for lowering the threshold for interim measures (see also the Commission \u2018Competition Law 4.0\u2019 (2019), p. 76).Commitment decisions under Art 9 Reg. 1\/2003 have proven a helpful tool, especially where new legal territory is explored (see e.g. the first signalling case under Article 101 TFEU,  AT.39850 - Container shipping), and should therefore be introduced if and when an ex-ante platform regulation is adopted.Third-party rights are enshrined in current procedural law, namely in Art. 27 Reg. 1\/2003 and should apply to any subsequent ex-ante platform regulation as well.As above (37.1).Any decision imposed on a private undertaking as addressee of an ex-ante regulation should, of course, have the right to judicial review. This is mandatory under both the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Art. 47-50) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Art. 6), though the latter has not been recognized as a source of law applicable to the EU institutions.As we have explained in detail in our answers to the questions in the previous sections, we consider that, in general, the current competition rules, i.e. Article 101, 102 TFEU as well as merger control provisions, are sufficient to address competition issues in the digital sector. We have also pointed out that it might be necessary to adapt the application of these rules to the digital sector by issuing guidance on market definition, market dominance criteria and enforcement priorities. \nWe have further acknowledged that, especially in gatekeeper scenarios, additional rules in terms of an ex-ante regulation may be called for which applies to dominant platforms. If experience with decision practice yet to be gathered should show that further rules, e.g. against self-preferencing, will be necessary to apply even below the dominance threshold (e.g. if dominance is uncertain in a duopoly scenario), we have advocated a case-by-case declaratory decision of \u201cstrategic market status\u201d\/\u201dparamount cross-market significance\u201d which allows to impose additional rules\/remedies in a second step. Hence, the choice of the above three options #1.-#3 with top priority for #1, second priority for #2, and third priority for #3.","2732":"The Qiy SchemeA human-centric solution to access, manage and share personal dataThis paper presents a personal data management system that is independent of political or commercial interests. It describes a model that is based on a human-centric approach to the managing and processing of personal data. The approach is aimed at bringing people in control of their personal data by providing tools for digital self-determination. Simultaneously, it provides for new opportunities for businesses to develop innovative personal data services on the basis of mutual trust. What\u2019s new is the fact that people can become an integrated part of the online digital world, which allows them to exercise control over their personal data by determining by themselves whether, with whom, for which purpose(s) and for how long they want to share which of their personal data.The system described in this paper takes the form of a scheme (the \u2018Qiy Scheme\u2019) that consists of an open and interoperable technical standard, an organisational layer and a legal layer.

Additionally, GDPR favours vertically integrated firms using data from affiliates (in sectors into which it has leveraged its dominance) without significant GDPR concerns, whereas non-vertically integrated firms will find it harder to form competitive consortia that comply with GDPR whilst sharing necessary data between the member firms. Most companies who aim to compete in the same markets as gatekeeper platforms or to launch innovative new products or services in related markets, but who do not benefit from the same or similar scale, may need to tackle a sort of prisoner\u2019s dilemma. They need to choose between: a) joining forces with the platform so to obtain a small and immediate advantage while renouncing to have more margin of manoeuvre to compete or, b) pursuing a long, time-and resource-consuming attempt to create an alternative solution which is not usually realistic as it requires huge financial investments and time. Even for big, structured actors it is difficult to pursue option b) as it will require two typically incompatible elements: first, they will need to create convergence between actors which normally compete fiercely; second, they will need to make sure the that relevant competition rules are respected. This last endeavour will need to be fulfilled on a self-assessment basisbased on a rigid competition law framework. It is extremely unlikely that option b) is followed by a sufficiently large number of operators to result in an effective competitor to the incumbent digital gatekeeper. Competition Authorities could address this situation by: 1) enhancing and accelerating the formal guidance process on applicability of 101(3) to these types of cooperation agreement, 2) toughening the Vertical Guidelines assessment of Vertical agreements between platforms and their actual or potential competitors, and 3) prioritizing enforcement of competition rules with regard to the mentioned anticompetitive behaviour carried out by platforms (i.e. tying, exclusivities, default settings, leveraging).\nRegarding point 2) vertical agreements have become the instrument by which gatekeepers expand their influence in neighboring markets by leveraging their market power & scale and by absorbing & controlling the data they produce.See answer to question 8.5 above.We believe that likely structural competition problems exerted by a few digital platforms can be best tackled through a smarter and faster application of current competition tools, supplemented by targeted ex ante regulation as proposed by the DSA. A thorough review of competition law to adapt current toolbox to the Digital Economy is needed (e.g. Review of Market Definition Notice, Merger Control Review, Horizontal & Vertical Guidelines, Article 102 Enforcement Priorities Guidelines), as well as further use of current tools set out by Regulation 1\/2003 (sector-inquiries, more efficient use of interim measures and in extreme cases, use of structural remedies in an ex-post intervention).","2737":"In addition, it is premature and inappropriate to consider introducing a brand-new competition tool before the new DSA has been introduced (its effectiveness has been analysed) and before modifications to the Commission\u2019s current antitrust enforcement guidelines have been implemented and assessed. Introducing any new tool in these circumstances will be at odds with the Proportionality Principle as identified in the TFEU. ","2738":"We consider that any new competition tool would need to be limited to large online platforms acting as gatekeepers, addressing only exceptional situations where alternative instruments have demonstrated being ineffective and be based on strict triggering criteria. A new tool should not give the Commission an indiscriminate power to intervene in markets on the basis of economic indicators. In addition, if a particular market is subject to existing regulation, this should be firstly considered to address any identified competition problems. This is to ensure that any new tool is not be applied to markets which are already regulated ex ante, where an existing sector-specific regulator will be best placed to address any problems identified by the Commission in a market study, thereby reducing scope for duplicative regulation, inconsistency or double jeopardy. In terms of remedies following any subsequent intervention via a new tool which may be necessary, where the relevant market is already regulated, these should be limited to recommendations to the relevant regulator or acceptance of voluntary commitments, rather than the imposition of behavioural or structural remedies. In addition, there must be adequate safeguards to ensure that the process is transparent and efficient (including in relation to timely challenge\/judicial review \u2013 see comments below).The articles are sufficient if supplemented by targeted ex ante regulation as per the DSA and a revised competition framework addressing the need for a quicker intervention on fast-moving markets (in particular: (i) revised market definition guidelines; (ii) widening and strengthening the applicability of interim measures limited in time and sector-inquiries; (iii) adapting the horizontal and vertical guidelines which would allow to increase the competitiveness of European firms that could challenge platforms in certain markets (iv) updating the Article 102 Enforcement Priorities Guidelines and (v) review of the EU\u2019s merger rules). ","2739":"Additionally, although we agree with the Commission\u2019s objective of tackling challenges posed by large online platforms acting as gatekeepers, we do not consider that any new tool should be extended to oligopoly markets  We recognize that certain common features common in digital markets contribute to competition problems, These features are quite different to the issues that might arise in oligopolistic markets, which should not be in the scope of a new tool for the following reasons \u2013 taking national telecommunications markets as an example: \n(i)\tThese markets do not display an entrenched lack of competition or the risk of monopolization, gatekeeping or tipping. This is confirmed by the recent General Court judgement on the Hutchison\/O2 case clarifying that the mere fact that a market is highly concentrated does not automatically result in a significant impediment of effective competition. \n(ii)\tThese markets are not problematic per se as they do not result in inefficient market outcomes by default..\n(iii)\tThese markets are not necessarily fast moving. We understand the proposed tool reflects the increasing concerns that fast moving digital markets cannot be effectively tackled 'after the event' under the existing competition law framework. There is no reason to assume that oligopolistic markets tend to be fast-moving. For example, telco markets, relative to digital markets, are not fast moving. Moreover, the recent debate on the opportunity to modify the market power threshold to regulate these markets has concluded with the EECC confirming dominance as the necessary premise of any ex ante regulation. Hence, the legislator has not considered necessary to lower the thresholds for regulating electronic communications markets. \n(iv)\tMany of such markets are subject to ex-ante regulation. Companies operating in oligopolistic markets, such as telcos, may be subject to heavy sector specific regulation in each country in which they operate. Regulations vary across countries, but examples of such regulations include the EECC and all local or similar laws implementing them. \n(v)\tThese markets face different commercial realities. Unlike certain gatekeepers which are extremely profitable, profitability and return on capital expenditure in the telecommunications sector is low.See answer to 8.2 above.See answer to 8.2 above.Markets where digital players are active (in particular, those characterized by the presence of gatekeeper platforms) demonstrate a general tendency to develop into monopolistic structures, where the combination of network effects, accumulation and control of important data, economies of scale and scope, lack of multi-homing and obstacles to consumer mobility, could allow gatekeeper platforms to achieve monopolistic or quasi-monopolistic positions. \nThis situation can hamper competition and innovation as well as developing attempts to monopolize adjacent markets.\u2022\tDefense of the primary monopoly position by developing strategies to eliminate the most threatening potential competitors (horizontal pre-emptive merger). \n\u2022\tBuying smaller innovators (conglomerate pre-emptive merger) in order to, for example, expand data held by the dominant platform or newly merged entity, which improves efficiency of its data analytics, thus reinforcing its dominance over time in multiple markets.\n\u2022\tTendency to leverage market power (e.g. through vertical agreements, business practices,  acquisitions, etc.)  into other adjacent markets which marginalizes existing competitors and creates obstacles for any new entry. This will eventually hamper\/reduce innovation in the market and diminish consumer choice. For example, denying inter-operability (e.g. refusing to provide access to APIs) to companies who want to compete in one market within a gatekeeper platform\u2019s ecosystem (e.g. RCS \u2013 see above).We are convinced that in such situations an intervention is needed. The real question, however, is whether, how and to what extent it is needed to create a brand new competition tool, especially if it is not confined to specific pre-defined actors for which the mentioned problems have been previously identified meaning large digital gatekeeper platforms and for which current competition toolbox has shown to be not enough. Last but not least, the need for such a tool should not be based on a \u201cgreenfield approach\u201d but should take into account all the alternative means of intervention (e.g. ex ante, asymmetric, regulatory measures along the lines of the ex ante regulation proposed in the DSA, symmetric regulation, sector-inquiries, interim antitrust measures, existing antitrust tools (article 102 notably), etc.) and ensure an efficient and faster interplay with such measures.See answer to questions above. In principle we consider all alternative possibilities should be explored (modifying guidelines, interim measures, ex ante regulation, etc.). Once all the alternatives have been considered, if there are still some structural competition problems that cannot be addressed by alternative, less intrusive measures, a new tool can be taken into consideration that will be applicable only to those market sectors where these problems are present (i.e. exclusively to the markets where the mentioned problems have been previously identified, meaning markets with large gatekeeper platform). In this case, the new tool should be drafted respecting the letter and spirit of the principle of Proportionality as laid down in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. According to Article 5, \u201cthe content and form of Union action shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties\u201d. Accordingly, the characteristics and scope of application of the new tool, if required, will need to be designed taking in the utmost account the need to only address situations which: (a) respond to the specific need to achieve the objectives of the Treaties and, (b) cannot be addressed through existing or less intrusive measures.  This tool shall therefore address structural competition problems related to specific characteristics of large digital platforms acting as gatekeepers. As explained in response to question 9.1 above, any new tool should not give the Commission an indiscriminate power to intervene in markets on the basis of indicative economic indicators (e.g. UPP \u2013 GUPPI \u2013 HHI \u2013 etc.) and should not be applied to markets which are already regulated ex ante, where the existing regulator will be best placed to address any problems identified by the Commission in a market study (in such cases, the tool should only be used to intervene where regulation is insufficient, and should only allow for recommendations to government\/regulations, or the acceptance of voluntary commitments, rather than behavioural or structural remedies). In addition, there must be adequate safeguards to ensure that the process is transparent and efficient (including in relation to timely challenge\/judicial review \u2013 see comments below).We do not think oligopolistic markets necessarily enable alignment of behavior neither in the form of concerted practices nor in the form of collective dominance at least as far as the relevant legal standards determined by the case law of the European Courts is concerned. ","2740":"More in general, we consider that competitive issues related to the functioning of oligopolies have little or nothing to do with the structural competitive problems that the new tool allegedly should address. There are in fact no operators in these markets that, based on their market power and characteristics, might be defined as gatekeepers. The competitive problems that the new tool is supposed to address are problems which, in principle, cannot be adequately addressed by ex ante regulation. Competitive issues related to oligopolistic markets, on the contrary, have not even so far  passed the relevant threshold for imposing regulatory ex ante remedies. It goes without saying, therefore, that these markets are not fit for being a test case of a new tool whose inherent reason to exist is that all other instruments (including ex ante regulation) are not sufficient. \nSee above answer 12.2","2741":"The Commission should make use of its existing powers to intervene where there has been or might be a breach of competition rules. An updated competition framework, in combination with targeted ex ante regulation of digital gatekeepers gives the Commission the tools needed to address the competitive issues (if any) arising in these markets. \nAny intervention in oligopolistic market needs to be based on the existing tools at the Commission\u2019s disposal i.e. existing competition tools and case law and, where applicable, ex ante regulatory remedies. We see no room for manoeuvre in justifying any type of intervention going beyond a thorough application of the relevant case law on collective dominance and concerted practices. \nWe consider therefore that markets not presenting the characteristics related to markets with gatekeepers do not require new legislative interventions, including the proposed tool.\nOligopolistic markets do not have the same features as the markets which the Commission has identified as problematic. Oligopolies, in fact, are at odds with the most important mentioned market failures that the potential new tool is supposed to address. As evident from the IIA, the potential new tool seems to be primarily aimed at tackling the features deriving from the characteristics of new digital, platform based, data driven markets \u2013 see, for example,: \u201cStructural competition problems concern structural market characteristics that have adverse consequences on competition and may ultimately result in inefficient market outcomes in terms of higher prices, lower quality, less choice and innovation\u201d. The IIA goes on to identify \u201cstructural lack of competition\u201d as one of two broad categories of structural competition problems, and within this category the IIA provides the example of \u201coligopolistic market structures which an increased risk for tacit collusion\u201d. Despite this, oligopolistic markets should not be the focus of any new tool given that such markets have entirely different market characteristics to those which the IIA simultaneously identifies as concerning: \u201cExtreme economies of scale and scope, strong network effects, zero pricing and data dependency, as well as market dynamics favouring sudden and radical decreases in competition (\u2018tipping\u2019) and \u2018winner-takes- most\u2019 scenarios\u201d. \n We note that the OECD study and paper from the LSE quoted by the Commission in its staff working paper contradict any hypothesis of the Commission that a New Competition Tool is needed to tackle concerns in oligopolistic markets.\nOECD \u2013 \u201cOur results should, thus, not be interpreted as unambiguous evidence of reduced competition, and much less yet of a need for particular policy interventions\u201d\nLSE \u2013 \u201cMany of the patterns are consistent with a more nuanced view where many industries have become \u201cwinner take most\/all\u201d due to globalization and new technologies rather than a generalized weakening of competition due to relaxed anti-trust rules or rising regulation.","2742":"We consider that, in principle, Articles 101 and 102, in combination with targeted ex ante regulation of digital gatekeepers, are sufficiently effective instruments to address anti-competitive behavior in oligopolistic markets and do not believe that oligopolistic market situations are per se problematic. A new competition tool is therefore not necessary for this purpose. We believe that competition concerns created by a large gatekeeper platforms can be better tackled if supplemented by appropriate, targeted ex ante regulation and through Articles 101 and 102 through smarter and faster application of current competition tools. A thorough review of competition law to adapt current toolbox to the Digital Economy is needed (e.g. Review of Market Definition Notice, Merger Control Review, Horizontal & Vertical Guidelines), as well as further use of current tools set out by Regulation 1\/2003 (sector-inquiries, more efficient use of interim measures and use of structural remedies in an ex-post intervention).","2743":"Tipping \/ \u2018winner takes all\u2019 situations may also happen in future markets, as large platforms are in the best position to enter and to succeed in these markets in the future.We believe that these features are very important because:\n\u2022\tStrong direct and indirect network effects in digital markets enables platforms to rapidly expand and gain market share \u2013 this can minimize market contestability and lead to \u2018winner takes all\u2019 scenarios. In addition, when players can leverage their customer base into related markets, this acts a huge advantage over new entrants. \n\u2022\tVertical integration can lead to consumer-lock in and allow greater data flow with less risk of antitrust enforcement or GDPR breaches. \n\u2022\tEconomies of scale and scope, \n\u2022\tEnabling multi-homing is also a very important feature to prevent markets from tipping as customers will not be locked into products or services offered by the same platform owner.\nIn addition, lack of access to non-rivalrous data, data accumulation, consumer lock in and obstacles for consumers to switch, are the most important features whereby anti-competitive conduct in (digital) markets can result in tipping a marketDigital gatekeeper platforms\u2019 business models are typically based on leveraging direct and indirect network effects by tying complementary products\/services, often offered for free on one side and monetized on the other side. The control and accumulation of data is the usual vehicle used to consolidate their power in a given market as well as to leverage their market power to enter rapidly in neighbouring markets. Barriers to entry emerge as companies\u2019 market shares increase, and the cumulative effect is that companies often compete for the market (rather than in the market) through exclusionary\/exploitative conduct.The Commission has already proven in several cases that all of the above are consequences of tipping markets (e.g. Google Shopping, Google AdSense). Therefore, the Commission should make use of its existing tools (and of their ongoing review) to ensure fast intervention in tipping markets. When competition law is not considered to be enough, the Commission should introduce targeted ex ante regulation through the proposed DSA legislation. ","2744":"Given the specificities of the digital economy at large, even when the markets have been correctly defined, the metrics used to assess the competitive position of market players requires particular attention. Indeed, the common metrics used in the competitive assessment (first and foremost, market shares) might not be appropriate indicators when dealing with multi-sided markets with one or more zero-priced sides and where innovation is important.","2745":"The assessment should here consider the characteristics of large digital platforms direct\/indirect network effects leading to market tipping and a \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d, concentrated market structure, role of data, etcWe are convinced that in such situations quick intervention is needed. However, we do not consider that a brand new competition tool is needed, especially if it is not based on a solid market power assessment and is not specific to pre-defined markets with gatekeeper platforms where the mentioned problems have been previously identified, if current competition laws are updated, in particular the use of interim measures, and supplemented by targeted ex ante regulation along the lines proposed in the DSA. The need for such a tool should not be based on a \u201cgreenfield approach\u201d but should take into account all the alternative means of intervention (e.g. ex ante, asymmetric, regulatory measures, symmetric regulation, interim antitrust measures, etc.)","2746":"Furthermore, it is not clear what the early intervention refers to and how an extensive market investigation process with all the necessary checks and balances could allow for effective early intervention How will the Commission decide when the moment to intervene comes? Is it an early intervention based on the anti-competitive conduct of a company or is it an early intervention going beyond an individual conduct and addressing structural market failures? In the second case, there is a risk of legal uncertainty and regulatory overreach.We believe that tipping market situations created by a few digital platforms can be better tackled in many cases through a smarter and faster application of current competition tools, in particular the use of interim measures, supplemented by ex ante regulation for digital platforms as part of the DSA reform. A thorough review of competition law to adapt current toolbox to the Digital Economy is needed (e.g. Review of Market Definition Notice, Merger Control Review, Horizontal & Vertical Guidelines, Article 102 Enforcement Guidelines), as well as further use of current tools set out by Regulation 1\/2003 (sector-inquiries, more efficient use of interim measures and in extreme cases use of structural remedies in an ex-post intervention).\nAs also mentioned throughout the questionnaire, we consider that all alternative possibilities should be explored (modifying guidelines, interim measures, ex ante regulation, etc.). In particular, once the DSA has been implemented, and an appropriate period of time has elapsed, we see merit in the Commission reviewing the effectiveness of the DSA. Once all the alternatives have been considered, if there are still some structural competition problems that cannot be addressed by alternative, less intrusive measures, a new tool can be taken into consideration that will be applicable only to those situations where these problems are present (i.e. those markets characterised by the presence of gatekeepers). In this case, the new tool should be drafted respecting the letter and spirit of the principle of Proportionality as laid down in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. According to Article 5, \u201cthe content and form of Union action shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties\u201d. Accordingly, the characteristics and scope of application of the new tool, if any, will need to be designed taking in the utmost account the need to only address situations which: (a) respond to the specific need to achieve the objectives of the Treaties and, (b) cannot be addressed through existing or less intrusive measures. See also the response to question 9.1 above in relation to the procedural safeguards which would be necessary.The digital markets characteristics, in particular the strong network effects fuelled by data-driven innovations and economies of scale and the close connection between some markets, lead to situations of a certain market power by one or few players, which may lead to \u201cgatekeeping\u201d position vis-a-vis markets and consumers as well as conglomerate presence. ","2747":"Platforms are not new, but digitalzation made them highly scalable, allowed them to collect and analyse unprecedented volumes of data, and gave a boost to their network effects. The impact of their business models on markets is therefore much bigger and amplified.See answer to questions 5, 18.4 and others above.We believe that the features listed in the table are helpful to qualify large online platforms acting as gatekeepers. As we also stated in previous answers, those platforms often provide not only one service, but an entire ecosystem, in which the platform\u2019s own services are usually integrated more closely with each other than with competing services, and as a result users can become locked into one platform\u2019s ecosystem. ","2748":"We also take the chance, in conjunction with our response to the DSA consultation, to list other features that we believe are relevant:\n\u2022\tDirect and indirect network effects.\n\u2022\tHigh barriers to entry.\n\u2022\tFree provisioning of services (which may increase information asymmetries).\n\u2022\tRole of data. Data is characterised by increasing marginal returns and thus gives rise to significant economies of scale. Moreover, due to its nature, data can be easily leveraged and used in diverse markets, enabling large economies of scope. \n\u2022\tConsumer behavioural biases, such as consumers\u2019 preference for default options.\n\u2022\tFirm\u2019s size, its financial and innovation capabilities, its integration in an ecosystem can also contribute to increasing market power and raising entry barriers. \n\u2022\tLack of countervailing buyer power.","2749":"These characteristics allow online platforms acting as gatekeepers to rapidly enter a new market and capture it creating barriers of entry for others, jeopardising future market contestability, as well as evicting \/ marginalizing traditional actors.The so-called \u201cgatekeepers\u201d control the access to a large part of end-users, enjoying a market position which is increasingly difficult to replicate because of network effects. This position often allows them to expand in neighbouring markets where other players would in theory have a competitive advantage and\/or are already active. In these cases, if the other players do not manage to match the scale of gatekeepers\u2019 users\u2019 base (and\/or their geographic reach) which is difficult to achieve without cooperating with peers (in turn challenging from competition standpoint),, they will eventually need to partner with the global players thus facilitating the expansion of their market power to these markets. Even if the other players do agree to cooperate in an attempt to compete, a gatekeeper may still seek to foreclose competition by e.g. refusing inter-operability.","2750":"Often this leveraging of market power into neighbouring markets creates a \u201cmulti-platform\u201d or ecosystem with the supply of various services that allow the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to obtain almost unique amount and variety of data. Once this \u201cgatekeeper\u201d position is no longer contestable this should raise concerns from a competitive perspective. Such concerns may arise in particular if the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d position is used to engage in exclusionary and\/or exploitative conducts, such as leveraging, tying or price discrimination, or engages in self-preferencing. Gatekeeping position is also used to impose unfair terms and conditions to businesses using the platform with the view to preserve the gatekeeping role.\n \nAnti-competitive effects that might derive from the concentration of large quantities of data may reduce the incentive for the dominant undertaking to compete on that specific profile of quality. Also, the privacy policy of a dominant undertaking might become a source of illicit competitive advantage, if it imposes terms and contract conditions which enable it to gather even more data in order to acquire\/strengthen its market power or create or strengthen barriers to entry. Other strategies to exclude competitors from the access to data could also be considered, under certain conditions, as an anticompetitive conduct.We are convinced that in similar situations an intervention is needed. More specifically, online platforms with gatekeeper role that should be subject to additional targeted ex ante regulation as contemplated by the DSA reforms.\nSee 19.3 answer below.We believe that most issues that might arise in \u201cgatekeeper markets\u201d can be tackled through: (i) a smarter and faster application of current competition tools (a thorough review of competition law to adapt current toolbox to the Digital Economy is needed (e.g. Review of Market Definition Notice, Merger Control Review, Horizontal & Vertical Guidelines, Article 102 Enforcement Guidelines), as well as further use of current tools set out by Regulation 1\/2003 (sector inquiries, more efficient use of interim measures and in extreme cases use of structural remedies in an ex-post intervention)); and (ii) targeted ex ante regulation along the lines proposed in the DSA.In this context, having regard to the mentioned need to apply the proportionality principle, we reiterate that it is necessary to first evaluate the impact of the existing measures and\/or of the measures that the DSA will eventually introduce. \nOnly if these measures will reveal themselves insufficient to tackle all existing problems that a new tool should then be considered. Any such tool would of course need to be limited to tackle the outstanding problems (and we would therefore expect that it would have a much narrower scope of application than the one presently envisaged in the ongoing consultation). ","2751":"Therefore, it seems appropriate to complement competition rules with the targeted ex ante rules that will be included in the DSA framework.As mentioned throughout the questionnaire, structural competition problems  occur more prominently in digital markets \u2013 in particular those with gatekeeper platforms. We believe that structural competition problems in non-digital markets are well tackled by sector-specific regulation as it is aimed at doing so. Therefore, a \u201cnew competition tool\u201d, if needed, should be aimed at addressing competition problems in digital markets exerted by large gatekeeper platforms and would be a (less effective) substitute to the DSA\u2019s proposal on ex-ante rules for digital platforms. Again, we believe that the economic sector-specific proposal of DG CNECT would be enough to tackle market failures over digital (in addition to the current competition law regime). \nPlease see also answer to question 5 and others above.We are convinced that in similar situations an intervention is needed, however, we do not believe that a new competition tool, especially one that is not limited to pre-defined to digital actors for which the mentioned problems have been previously identified, is necessary. The need for such a tool should not be based on a \u201cgreenfield approach\u201d but should take into account the current competition law regime (which as explained above should be updated) and all the alternative means of intervention (e.g. ex ante, asymmetric, regulatory measures, symmetric regulation, etc.) In addition, any such tool should contain sufficient safeguards to ensure that enforcement powers do not overreach (see the response to question 33 below for more detail on the safeguards which would be needed).See answers to questions above.While Articles 101 and 102 TFEU have proven flexible in tackling many types of competition problem, we believe that their effectiveness can be improved by ongoing initiatives such as targeted ex ante regulation as per the proposed DSA, and a revised competition framework addressing the need for a quicker intervention on fast-moving markets (in particular: (i) revised market definition guidelines; (ii) widening and strengthening the applicability of interim measures and sector-inquiries; (iii) adapting the horizontal and vertical guidelines which would allow to increase the competitiveness of European firms that could challenge platforms in certain markets (iv) review of EUMR).n.a.See answer to question 22.1 and others aboven.a.The Commission should first continue with the ongoing review of the competition law framework before considering introducing any additional tools. However, there is a need to update and adapt the tools and methodologies of the current rules to the new digital environment. For example, the Market Definition Notice review should be carefully carried out taking into consideration the increasing digitalisation and globalisation of the economy. Competition rules have proven to be flexible enough in the past so their update and more efficient use should be enough to tackle most of the structural competition problems put forward in section C. The Commission should speed up antitrust processes and make more use of its existing powers to impose interim measures \u2013 like those imposed in October 2019 for the first time in nearly two decades- to ensure fast intervention and avoid irreparable damages to the market, consumers and competitors. In addition, as said in our joint response to the DSA consultation, the Commission should introduce ex ante regulation in the DSA in specific markets with gatekeeper platforms to address those problems that competition law cannot tackle (refer to the DSA response).  \nTherefore, the Commission should only consider introducing a new competition tool if, after the review, it is proven that the structural competition problems in C cannot be tackled by the current competition law or by the use of ex ante regulation in specific markets. \nAdditionally, it is not clear whether articles 103 and 114 TFEU provide an adequate legal basis for introducing such a tool. We believe that there is general consensus in the competition community, including within DG COMP, that article 103 TFEU could not be the legal basis for a competition tool operating outside 101 and 102 TFEU (i.e. options 3 and 4 in the Inception Impact Assessment). Moreover, it does not seem that article 103 TFEU would provide the adequate legal basis for options 1 and 2 either insofar as the tool seems to be aimed at creating competition and would apply (according to this questionnaire and the IIA) in the absence of a competition law breach.\nArticle 114 TFEU would be the legal basis for an internal market investigation tool, however, it is clear from this questionnaire as well as from the IIA that the new tool would deal with structural competition problems. Therefore, article 114TFEU does not seem to be the adequate legal basis for a tool following options 3 or 4). \nLast, even if Articles 103 and 114 would constitute an adequate legal basis  a thorough application of the Proportionality Principle should be at the basis of the scope of application of a new tool and a number of important safeguards along the lines of those referred to in response to question 33 below would be required. Accordingly, any new tool should be applied only to situations and enforcement gaps which cannot be adequately tackled by using other more proportionate and effective measureWe do not believe that the new tool is necessary for the reasons provided in response to question 24 (i.e. the Commission has already powers for early intervention under the current competition law regime through interim measures or by sector specific legislation) and can be supplemented by the targeted ex ante regulation along the lines of that proposed in the DSA. Even if the tool would not enable the Commission impose fines, it would enable the Commission to impose remedies (see also sections below) without first making a finding of an infringement of competition rules. \nIn this sense, and as it would be explained below, we believe that any potential tool should not be able to impose fines or penalties when there is no infringement of competition rules. Furthermore, the tool should not impose structural remedies as divestiture remedies can be drastic and fundamentally change market structure. Stopping company\u2019s business strategies or models when there is no breach of competition rules should in any case be considered as an intrusive penalty even if the monetary implications are indirect. \nAlso, it is not clear what the early intervention refers to and how an extensive market investigation process with all the necessary checks and balances could allow for effective early intervention: How will the Commission decide when the moment to intervene comes? Is it an early intervention based on the anti-competitive conduct of a company or is it an early intervention going beyond an individual conduct and addressing structural market failures? In the second case, there is a risk of legal uncertainty and regulatory overreach.\nFinally, it needs to be highlighted again that, in any case, a potential tool should not apply to markets that are already regulated. Any NCT that is launched by DG COMP should follow checks and balances similar to the CMA\u2019s Market Investigation tool to trigger the procedure (see please GSMA-ETNO\u2019s Annex and the following answers), and the scope of application should be limited to digital markets. We are convinced that likely structural competition problems in non-digital markets are well tackled by sector-specific regulation as it is aimed at doing so.\nHence, a potential tool\u2019s powers to impose remedies should be subject to limitations given that there is no proven-wrongdoing and therefore only be used if necessary and appropriate to eliminate competition concerns.As explained in questions 24 and 25 and other above, we do not believe that there is a need for a tool on any of the basis above. As it will be further developed below, any potential tool should only intervene to solve the problems mentioned in section C that are present in markets with gatekeeper platforms.","2752":"If a new tool in line with CMA\u2019s Market Investigation tool is considered necessary, it should only be triggered in a set of limited circumstances (see answer 27.1.) and applied to pre-defined actors. It is important to note that a with a wide intervention scope will lead to false positives and excessive intervention. We believe that limiting the scope of a potential tool as well as ensuring a proper system of checks and balances in the line of those mentioned in question 27 and others in this questionnaire would help in preventing these problems.  ","2753":"As explained above (questions 27 and 28.1), if at all it should be limited to new circumstances in digital markets. The structural problems identified in the present document are exclusively those related to certain characteristics of certain digital actors. These characteristics are often present in digital, data-driven, platform-based markets where digital actors are active. Accordingly, as the Commission is fulfilling its duty of motivating the need for this tool with exclusive reference to markets affected by digitalisation and their characteristics, it should coherently avoid including other categories of markets unless and until a similar motivation (which should be based on precedents and data on markets\u2019 performances) is added.If, having reviewed the effectiveness of a revised competition framework and the DSA over an appropriate period following implementation, the new competition tool is deemed necessary and limited in application to  markets affected by digitalisation, the Commission should be able to accept voluntary commitments and as well as to make the recommendations above and impose behavioural remedies only where the commission identifies a remediable adverse effect on competition to a sufficiently high standard of proof. ","2754":"As mentioned above, structural remedies would be disproportionate in circumstances where not all less invasive remedies have already been applied and where no infringement of competition law would need to be demonstrated. Moreover, if the Commission is ultimately given power to impose structural remedies under a NCT (if any), as structural remedies are very severe sanctions they should only ever be used as a last resort and subject to a very strict burden of proof i.e. necessity, proportionality, etc.As explained in the answers above, we believe that DG COMP should focus first on continuing with the ongoing review of the current competition law framework and the proposed ex ante regulation of gatekeeper platforms through the DSA. Only if these prove to be insufficient should the Commission consider the introduction of a new tool targeted to large digital platforms acting as gatekeepers. ","2755":"It would be of utmost importance that the tool\u2019s framework for intervention, its application, scope, authority(ies) involved and decision process are clearly defined and limited to situations which create structural competition problems and cannot be addressed under existing  tools, meaning digital platforms acting as gatekeepers. In particular, it would be key to include the adequate framework for checks and balances to grant the industry with the necessary legal certainty as explained in 27,28 and 33.","2756":"As detailed below, and in order to ensure the effectiveness of the tool, it would also be key to provide the Commission with the necessary powers. Equally, it would be key to provide the companies with the necessary time to provide input to the Commission.First of all, it would be key to define which authority(ies) can trigger and need to be involved to ensure legitimacy and proportionality. ","2757":"As initially stated in question 33.1, it would be key to provide the Commission with the necessary powers to effectively enforce such a tool, whilst ensuring that the process is transparent and that parties are given the opportunity to meaningfully engage with the Commission from an early stage and throughout the process. In particular, the Commission must:\n\u2022\tConsult with companies before issuing information requests to ensure that these are appropriately targeted and proportionate in scope.\n\u2022\tProvide the industry with the possibility to give input and feedback on the investigation and parties must be given access to and opportunity to respond to Commission working papers, issues papers, provisional findings, etc. before the Commission issues a final decision.\n\u2022\tIn order to be able to respond to information requests, give companies a reasonable timeframe for responding and the possibility to extend such a timeframe under certain conditions. \n\u2022\tComplement the new tool legislation with ad hoc guidance for the companies on how to respond to the Commission\u2019s requests as well as on the burden of proof.\n\u2022\tIntroduce the possibility of holding individual and multi-party hearings upon the interested parties\u2019 request. \n\u2022\tIn line with the CMA\u2019s approach, put in place a decision-making panel which is independent from the case team.","2758":"\nWe consider that it would be crucial for the Commission (and parties should they choose to do so) to engage and receive input from independent experts in the field. In fact, at least one of these experts should be part of the decision-making panel together with Commission officials in a model similar to the existing CMA market investigation tool.","2759":"Should a penalty or remedies system be imposed, this should include the possibility of timely judicial review. In particular, this review or appeal system should be available for challenging substantive findings made by the Commission, as well as procedural points, for example when deadline extensions have not been granted or to assess by independent experts the veracity or completeness of the responses to requests for information.Should the Commission introduce a tool, it would be key to give adequate legal certainty and clarity to the companies operating in the sectors being investigated. These companies would need to prepare for the investigations and to ensure that they allocate the necessary resources to it. As it could end up being an extremely costly exercise in terms of time and resources, it is important that the Commission\u2019s investigatory powers are limited in time (whilst ensuring that the parties have adequate time to respond to RFIs, working papers, put-backs, provisional findings, proposed remedies, etc.). On balance, the Commission should introduce at most an 18 month deadline for market investigations, which should be subject to a mandatory timetable binding on the Commission, and should include an emerging issues paper.If the Commission followed the proposal in question 34 and ensured the fast application of the tool, there should not be a need to impose interim measures. Giving the Commission the possibility to introduce such measures in the absence of a potential breach of competition law would not only fall outside article 8 of Regulation 1\/2003 but also leave the companies in an extreme uncertainty and can cause irreparable harm. ","2760":"To the contrary, as expressed in questions 9.3 and others above, subject to certain necessary updates, the current competition law regime, including interim measures during Article 101 or 102 investigations supplemented by targeted ex ante regulation of gatekeeper platforms along the lines proposed in the DSA constitute adequate alternatives to a new tool as they allow for fast intervention even when a competition breach has not yet been proven.Companies involved should have the right to propose voluntary commitments in order to solve the Commission\u2019s concerns. Again, this process and its timelines should be clearly defined in the legislation and include the assessment of an independent expert in the field. ","2761":"Additionally, if voluntary commitments are accepted, the Commission should be precluded from investigating the same markets within a certain timeframe.As already stated above and as in the CMA\u2019s market investigation tool, the companies involved should be given the right to comment during the process \u2013 in particular in response to working papers, written put-backs, provisional findings and draft remedies \u2013 before these are final. This step is crucial in order to allow the companies the opportunity to offer voluntary commitments.","2762":"As also expressed above, it would be absolutely necessary to give the companies a reasonable timeframe to respond to requests, provide information, respond to Commission findings and propose remedies.Companies operating in the markets concerned or those that would be potentially affected by the proposed remedies should be given the possibility to comment on the appropriateness of such remedies in a timely manner. As also stated above, even in this process it would be necessary to involve independent experts to analyse the remedies.As described in detail above, legal certainty, due process and checks and balances would be key for applying such a tool. The companies involved should have a clear view of the timelines and be given the opportunity to respond in a timely manner to the Commission findings as they emerge at various key stages of the process (see in particular the response to question 33.3 above). Additionally, it would be important for the parties for be able to challenge the process as well as the outcome via a fast-track appeal to the Court of Justice. In this regard, the grounds for review should be sufficiently broad, at least in the early years of its potential application, due to the novelty and potential intrusiveness of such a tool. This would be particularly important if the Commission is granted powers to impose remedies to the companies affected. ","2763":"Additionally, DG COMP should involve different departments with experts in the markets investigated (for instance, DG CONNECT for telecommunications or digital market investigations) and ensure that these departments can provide input throughout the process.As explained in the answers above, we believe that DG COMP should focus first on continuing with the ongoing review of the current competition law framework and on the DSA proposal for targeted ex ante regulation of gatekeeper platforms. Only if these two developments prove to be insufficient should the Commission consider the introduction of a new competition tool targeted to large digital platforms acting as gatekeepers. Any new competition tool should be limited to large online platforms acting as gatekeepers and carve out already regulated sectors that are subject to sector-specific regulation. We make some suggestions in the questionnaire and the Annex on how an NCT should look like.","2764":"More specifically, a framework allowing for the possibility to impose tailored remedies on individual large online platforms with gatekeeper power, on a case- by-case basis (option 3 in the table at question 25 in the DSA consultation) would be the most suitable to ensure competition and contestability in dynamic digital markets. This framework could be complemented by prohibitions generally applicable to all large online platforms with gatekeeper power (option 2 in the table at question 25 in the DSA consultation) as a baseline safeguard against some abusive behaviours. However, the latter option alone would be insufficient to address market failures related to large online platforms with gatekeeper role in a targeted and proportionate manner. Therefore, we strongly support the option 3 listed in the table at question 25 of the DSA consultation; a combination of option 3 with option 2 as a complement could also be suitable.","2765":"Finally, there is a risk of overlap and potential inconsistency between the regulatory framework allowing for a case-by-case imposition of targeted remedies under option 3, and the New Competition Tool. A single instrument that provided for imposing tailored remedies on individual large online platforms with gatekeeper power, if properly defined in its scope and through an efficient institutional setup, would be sufficient to tackle asymmetries and competition issues raised in the markets where digital platforms with a gatekeeper role operate, as it has been explained throughout this questionnaire.","2766":"Vinted marketplace is focused on women\u2019s, children\u2019s and men\u2019s clothes, shoes and accessories. Available on iOS, Android, and desktop browsers, Vinted provides private users a platform to sell and buy fashion items and ways to communicate with other members, namely using the forums and personal messages. In most of the markets Vinted offers integrated payment and shipping solutions, meaning that users can complete transactions without leaving the platform.Vinted categorises its services exclusively as falling under the \u2018e-commerce marketplace\u2019 category. Vinted\u2019s service is primarily tailored to second-hand fashion community and provides an environment facilitating successful transactions between private sellers and buyers. This might be achieved through features, such as integrated payments, integrated shipping, Value-added services (sellers\u2019 ability to promote and increase items\u2019 visibility to increase the probability of sale), etc.Please see above.Vinted relies on cooperation with digital services providers \/ digital operators and online platform providers to deliver value to customers and to ensure optimal service \/ product performance. We use many different digital services to provide our service, such as third party cloud storage solutions, digital advertising tools, sing in features, etc. Vinted understands that, in general, its use of digital services, in terms of range and intensity, does not materially differ from any other business. This is due to the fact that digital services have become a backbone infrastructure for almost all businesses.","2767":"Interaction and interoperability between different digital services providers ensures that customers continuously receive benefits arising from high quality experience and service quality \/ offering improvements, while using services rendered by different service providers at the same time. For example, we use social network platforms to raise awareness about our services, interact directly with our customer base through dedicated Vinted pages \/ profiles and, ultimately, advertise our services to our target audience through online display ads.","2768":"In the foreseeable future, we expect to use various digital services and, therefore, collaborate with various digital services providers. However, despite that some of the digital services are essential for our business, there are no such digital services providers that we would be very dependent on, meaning that, in our current view, they could be replaced by others and their digital services.Vinted is aware of the features\/elements listed as items A-Q under question 6 above to a different extent. We refer to items B, N, Q as being \u2018very important\u2019 because Vinted understands that, if faced directly, these features could potentially severely hinder the development of Vinted\u2019s services to the second-hand fashion community.","2769":"We mark items A, C-E, G-M, O-P as \u2018somewhat important\u2019 because we agree that, in theory, the individual or combined effect of these features have the potential to generate adverse market conditions which may result in reduced capability to offer competitive products \/ services. However, Vinted has not yet been exposed to such elements to a significant extent.","2770":"From our perspective, all market characteristics categorized by the European Commission as falling under \u2018structural risks for competition\u2019 or \u2018structural lack of competition\u2019 scenarios, listed as items A-Q, do not rise to the level of severity to be described as \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 necessitating regulatory intervention into the natural course of market development on the basis of ex ante rules.","2771":"Regulatory intervention against genuine \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 by way of enforcing established EU competition law rules is an effective tool to re-balance bargaining power or provide protection against discrimination or self-preferential practices of individual major online platforms which poses the risk of artificially diverting traffic away from Vinted apps \/ services (see our views on the introduction of general ex ante regime under section D below).","2772":"Whilst we acknowledge and share the view of the European Commission that individual markets may have features due to effect of which the main players in these markets face less competitive pressure, Vinted points out that such market deficiencies should be characterised as limited to a particular point in time (or prevalent in a more extended timeline), but not as always permanent, nor completely irreversible by way of natural market development.","2773":"The ecosystems in which digital service providers operate have enabled Vinted and other technology-based fashion e-commerce platforms to establish new business models in the market. This has facilitated the fashion community\u2019s transition from the location-limited and rather static world of \u2018yellow-pages\u2019, wallboard advertising and single-user fashion, to a world enriched by social interactions, unrestricted by location and encouraging of the sustainable repeat use of fashion items.","2774":"Incentives for e-commerce platforms to enter the market, invest heavily and compete depend on the possibility of becoming a very successful market player and receiving benefits associated with maintaining such position. In other words, incentives to enter into the market, invest and introduce game, changing innovations also largely depend on the possibility to generate adequate returns. Innovations and market entry are costly, hence, they require funding, but are also risky, as it is not possible to guarantee financial return beforehand. Further, the need for funding translates into the need to price the risk and reward, in the case investment is successful. From this financial risk pricing perspective, it is absolutely rational to incentivise investments on the basis of the prospect of high returns. ","2775":"The introduction of more regulation which has the power to artificially reshape markets and business models, could adversely affect the funding possibilities for new, or still developing products, which have the potential to outcompete existing products \/ services. Equally, such regulatory tools have the potential to place EU-based entrepreneurship in a disadvantaged position compared to the rest of the world. ","2776":"In light of all these risks, the mere market characteristics appear to be more associated with natural variation in market development, rather than being a \u2018competition problems\u2019, i.e. scenarios which could not remedy themselves through natural market development cycles. In broad terms, we understand that the European Commission suggests to re-qualify what is generally understood as \u2018competition deficiencies \/ competition restrictions \/ entry barriers\u2019 into \u2018competition problems\u2019, however, from our viewpoint, we do not see this move as sufficiently justified.We refer to items 1-2 as being \u2018very important\u2019, i.e. market power extension to related markets; and anti-competitive monopolisation based on capacity to put competitors at disadvantage in the market unfairly because recently we have observed similar scenarios emerging when one important digital player, holding access to its respective ecosystem, attempted to use its access to data in order to enter into new markets and rapidly gain market share.","2777":"We mark items 5-6 (\u2018gatekeeper scenarios\u2019 and \u2018tipping\u2019) as \u2018Important\u2019, because we agree that, in theory, these features have potential to generate adverse market conditions which may result in reduced capability to offer competitive products \/ services, however, Vinted has not yet been exposed to such elements to a significant extent. Further, \u2018gatekeeper scenarios\u2019 and \u2018tipping\u2019, in accordance with their definitions stated above, appear to be very similar in terms of effects to (i) market power extension; and (ii) anti-competitive monopolisation, as they ultimately result in foreclosure of other market operators.","2778":"We hold the view that although the market scenarios listed above could raise competition concerns, and therefore, may call for regulatory intervention by way of enforcing already established EU competition rules, these scenarios do not rise to the level of severity to qualify as what the European Commission calls \u2018structural competition problems\u2019. We also do not believe that these scenarios justify the introduction of an ex ante rules based regulatory regime.","2779":"In relation to \u2018structural competition problems\u2019, Vinted would like to point out to the European Commission that there is no settled answer on whether these problems, also seen as \u2018gap cases\u2019, exist in markets at all. This has even been admitted by the European Commission itself, in the Initial Impact Assessment (\u2018IIA\u2019). Vinted will now briefly address the presented market scenarios individually and explain why, in our view, these are not on the level of severity to qualify as \u2018structural competition problems\u2019, which need to be addressed by a tool as drastic as the ex ante regime.","2780":"Vinted believes that competition concerns arising from anti-competitive monopolisation and highly concentrated markets can be dealt with by the efficient and timely use of existing competition tools, namely Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. These tools are designed to deal with unilateral anti-competitive behaviour as well as part of coordinated behaviour forms and have proved to be highly adaptable and malleable through various shifts in markets.","2781":"Vinted wishes to note that it has not come across and has no relevant experience with \u2018pricing algorithms. Although these tools may be found in the advertising procurement context, in our main market \u2013 the second-hand fashion clothing e-commerce market \u2013 such tools are irrelevant, as most items sold by our customers are individual items listed on e-commerce \/ online classified ads platforms.","2782":"Further, Vinted would like to point out that there is no single definition of the term \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 in competition law. From the table above, it appears that the European Commission considers lack of multi-homing (situations where consumers use two or more competing products or services at once) to be the defining feature of a \u2018gatekeeper scenario\u2019. It is unclear to Vinted why a company should be considered a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 due to possessing some switching barriers.","2783":"In practice, many markets that are not perceived as prone to \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 lack multi-homing. Additionally, it is doubtful that lack of multi-homing can be perceived as a \u2018structural competition problem\u2019 in markets characterised by a zero-price environment, where consumers can switch between services or products easily if they feel unsatisfied with them, even if they use only one service or product at a time. However, please see answers to questions No 18-19 for the presentation of Vinted views regarding \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 concept in more detail.","2784":"Last, it is clear from the IIA that markets prone to \u2018tipping\u2019 is another focus area of the NCT. The table above defines \u2018tipping markets\u2019 as \u2018markets where the number of customers is a key element for business success\u2019. First, this focus on \u2018tipping\u2019 is problematic as it essentially equates successful business growth to something that is negative and should be avoided. Focusing on this notion of \u2018tipping\u2019 could stifle innovation, creativity and growth in the Single Market \u2013 all which competition policy should be designed to encourage. Second, there is no empirical evidence that supports the existence of the phenomenon of \u2018tipping' markets. Hence, it follows that there is an insufficient base to justify a tool as invasive as the proposed NCT.Vinted believes that the enlargement of offering is prevalent in digital sectors \/ markets just as much as in any given sector \/ market. We believe that the search for synergies and new business development opportunities is common practice in nearly all sectors, as this is an efficient use of existing company capital and time-tested business growth strategy. All companies, regardless of the sector \/ market they operate in, are constantly looking for synergies and new opportunities. Usually, the extension of market power into a related market \/ sector is the most rational move to achieve this. Thus, situations where companies extend their market power into related markets \/ sectors is prevalent in all sectors, and not only the digital sector \/ e-commerce sector.In most instances, leading companies use leveraging to expand their operations and improve the value of their offering by expanding their range. On face value, we view such extensions of operations as a reiteration of the same business model with another product.","2785":"However, we understand that leveraging practices, by employing artificial tying of \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018non-core\u2019 products \/ services could raise anti-competitive effects by diversion of traffic \/ sales from non-leading companies. Such harmful anti-competitive results could materialise if a market power-wielding firm employs its \u2018core\u2019 product in a way which eliminates customers from meaningful access to competitors\u2019 products (i.e. results in foreclosure).","2786":"However, in terms of legal remedies, Vinted does not identify legal and practical obstacles which indicate that Article 102 TFEU cannot be effectively enforced against leading companies, engaging in such anti-competitive leveraging or other types of anti-competitive market power extension strategies. Indeed, we hold that genuine competition concerns arise if leading companies engage in strategies which affect the \u2018playing field\u2019, i.e. limit competition \u2018on the merits\u2019.","2787":"In other words, maintaining the existing legal rulebook, in a way which confers Article 102 TFEU its effectiveness through more effective (and more intensive) enforcement, would in its own right contribute towards the elimination or minimisation of competition concerns, arising from leveraging strategies. Whereas the use of ex ante rules in form of NCT, could potentially disincentivise investments into advancement of innovation (see Vinted\u2019s answer to question No 6 above).","2788":"Please note that \u2018ex ante rules in form of NCT\u2019 refer to all Options 1-4 as distinguished in the European Commission\u2019s IIA].Vinted holds the view that the European Commission, at present, has the right to enforce TFEU Article 102, and thereby, to intervene in situations where structural competition problems arise due to repeated strategies by companies with market power to extend their market position into related markets.","2789":"Intervention addressing structural problems, e.g. imposing structural remedies on the basis of ex ante rules, raises risk that such decisions would largely be based on rather arbitrary assessment without due regard to legal certainty. The enforcement of EU competition rules is based on deliberate actions of individual firms \u2013 e.g., the conclusion of an agreement, conduct of a specific firm at a specific time. Whereas the imposition of structural remedies to address structural competition problems would largely be based on assessment conducted by a competition authority, detached from any particular \u2018triggering event\u2019.","2790":"While it remains to be seen if these goals are compatible, at this point there is a risk that these goals may contradict each other because the substance of the \u201cfair and undistorted competition\u201d policy goal is not defined. Also, there appears to be no clear demarcation of when and under what circumstances the European Commission suggests that it should have the powers to intervene against attempts by companies with market power to extend their market position into related markets. Indeed, there is a risk that the NCT could be used to avoid the burden of proof, legal and procedural guarantees, and other elements of the established EU competition rules enforcement framework that limit the extent of the European Commission\u2019s investigative powers.","2791":"More transparency on the objectives of NCT and measures envisaged to rectify different competition tools would better inform stakeholders about the contemplated breadth, effects and impact of NCT on the EU competition policy.In line with our answers above, the design of TFEU Article 102 is specifically aimed at addressing not what could be described in broad terms as mere competition imperfections or adverse market conditions, but indeed competition problems, causing direct harm to the competitive process and, from a long-term perspective, causing net negative effects to consumers.","2792":"In this light, the use of ex ante rules in form of NCT to address anti-competitive market power extensions, could potentially disincentivise investments advancing innovation (see Vinted\u2019s answer to question No 6 above).In our knowledge, there is a possibility that players in the digital services sector could have been using content (data), generated by its e-commerce partners, to propel their own similar services. However, we have not yet observed any market practices based on anti-competitive monopolisation strategies, entailing imposition of unfair business practices or by limiting access to key inputs, such as data.Please see our answer to question No 8.2.","2793":"Vinted shares the view that anticompetitive monopolisation, as described by the European Commission above, has potential to foreclose access to the market and to consumers which would be the result of competition \u2018not on the merits\u2019. For this reason, we agree that anti-competitive monopolisation warrants regulatory intervention on the basis of established EU competition rules, i.e. by way of enforcement of Article 102 TFEU.Consistently with our position stated above, we maintain that the European Commission could intervene to address anti-competitive monopolisation by actively enforcing Article 102 TFEU. Using this tool, instead of ex ante rules in form of NCT, to address anti-competitive market power extensions, would preserve the incentivisation of investments, and thus, facilitate advancement in innovation (see Vinted answer to question No 6 above).In line with our answers to questions 7.1., 8.2., 8.7., 17.1., 17.3., 19.1., 22.1., 22.2, Vinted believes that any competition concerns arising from anti-competitive monopolisation and highly concentrated markets can be dealt with through the efficient and timely use of existing competition tools, namely Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. ","2794":"These tools are designed to deal with unilateral anti-competitive behaviour and various forms of coordinated behaviour between undertakings. Vinted believes these tools have proved to be highly adaptable and malleable through various shifts in markets, and therefore, can deal with any \u2018structural competition problems\u2019, if and when these arise and rise to the severity that presents a need for intervention. ","2795":"Further, Vinted believes that the usage of current competition tools \u2013 Articles 101 and 102 TFEU \u2013 brings more legal clarity for companies operating in the Single Market. The introduction of the NCT, or any new competition mechanism \/ tool, would threaten legal clarity, as it would raise a number of questions, such as the availability of judicial review, appropriate safeguards and procedure \u2013 all questions that are difficult to answer, considering there is no judicial precedent on the NCT.Vinted would have wanted to press \u201cno\u201d as an option but also to add some explanations.  As there was no option for additional explanations when pressing \u201cno\u201d, Vinted pressed \u201cyes\u201d to provide the explanation why we choose \u201cno\u201d option.","2796":"Vinted doubts whether there is even a possibility of coordinated actions between competitors competing in the online second-hand fashion category. This is because it would be very difficult to reach understanding on common strategy in the online second-hand fashion market, as well as alignment on various competition \u2018points\u2019 \/ parameters. Therefore, Vinted believes that the situations and actions described above do not apply to the markets it operates in.","2797":"Therefore, in practical terms, any coordination would necessitate some platforms to change business models, for which there is hardly any tangible incentive. Also, in connection with said considerations, it is very doubtful if any companies in the online second-hand fashion segment could possess market power due to existing market structures, let alone abuse this market power. Therefore, in the online second-hand fashion sector Vinted does not observe any characteristics of structural risks, nor structural lack of competition.","2798":"Vinted would like to highlight that it has not come across and has no experience with \u2018pricing algorithms\u2019. Although these tools \/ use of such tools may be observed in the advertising procurement context, in our main market \u2013 the second-hand fashion clothing e-commerce market \u2013 such tools are irrelevant. This is because most items on our platform are sold by our customers. These are individual items, i.e. various fashion goods which are described on the basis of individual features (e.g. different levels of wear and tear, quality, completeness) which are listed on e-commerce \/ online classified ads platforms. The prices for the listed items are determined by the sellers themselves and not the marketplace. Thus, such \u2018pricing algorithms\u2019 do not apply to the market Vinted operates in.","2799":"We are aware that pricing algorithms are being used in digital sectors \/ markets.Since Vinted does not interact intensively with the effects or use of pricing algorithms, we cannot provide further evidence on competition concerns arising from the use of pricing algorithms.Vinted would have wanted to press \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d as an option but also to add some explanations.  As there was no option for additional explanations when pressing \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d, Vinted pressed \u201cyes\u201d to provide the explanation why we choose \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d option.","2800":"Vinted would like to highlight that it has not come across and has no experience with \u2018pricing algorithms\u2019. Although these tools \/ use of such tools may be observed in the advertising procurement context, in our main market \u2013 the second-hand fashion clothing e-commerce market \u2013 such tools are irrelevant, as most items sold by our customers are individual items listed on e-commerce \/ online classified ads platforms. As Vinted does not have any experience regarding pricing algorithms, we are not in position to present a detailed opinion on whether such intervention by the European Commission is indeed needed to preserve \/ improve competition.","2801":"In the digital services sector it is fairly common that the network effects and economies of scale tip the market towards market leaders. However, such tipping is connected with the utility that individual customers receive due to the number of other customers using the platform, i.e. the larger the number of customers that use the platform, the higher the utility an individual customer receives and benefits from.","2802":"For more details on features of the online second-hand fashion segment, please see answer to question No 42 below.We consider these features to be relevant to describe a market in a specific phase of its development in accordance with the established economic thinking.See answer to question 16.2. above.Vinted has not closely observed such effects taking place in the markets where Vinted is present, therefore Vinted is not the best place to accurately rate the individual importance of such effects.Although Vinted recognises the existence of \u2018tipping\u2019 in certain markets, we believe that there is no need for the Commission to inhibit the natural course of market development with intervention.Vinted holds the view that there are no robust economic grounds justifying intervention into the natural course of market development. We consider the notion of a \u2018tipping market\u2019 to be a natural phase of a market. Therefore, an intervention into such market phases may destroy incentives for new entrants which would otherwise be willing to enter and disrupt the market with a new value proposal (in terms of value transferred to consumers).Vinted holds the view that the existing regulation, in form of Article 102 TFEU, has sufficient legal power to prevent anti-competitive outcomes arising in connection with \u2018tipping market\u2019. In our understanding, the European Commission has no lack of legal competence to intervene and enforce Article 102 TFEU in a wide variety of situations, which, i.a., involve usage of market power geared towards foreclosure or elimination of competitors or distortion of competition conditions. Therefore, in our opinion, there is no extra \u2018need\u2019 for the European Commission to intervene in \u2018tipping\u2019 market scenarios. Vinted believes that such interventions by the European Commission are likely to have a counter-intuitive effect, stifling creativity, innovation and reducing intensity of competition. There would also be significant potential overlap between the NCT, allowing for pre-emptive intervention in \u2018tipping markets\u2019, and existing competition tools. This would undoubtedly give rise to over-regulation and legal uncertainty.Also, importantly, at this point it is not clear what would be the objective of such intervention by the European Commission \u2013 raising \/ protecting consumer welfare or targeting any other objective.In light of these highlighted concerns connected with the introduction of NCT, before proceeding with the introduction of any new ex ante regulation, we would first welcome more Article 102 TFEU enforcement aimed towards anti-competitive behaviour originating from the formation of \u2018tipping market\u2019. Such enforcement would create important precedents and after judicial review, these precedents would contribute to \u2018the rulebook\u2019. We are strong believers in the existing EU competition law framework. While attempting to realistically assess NCT, we understand that such novel regulation would inevitably introduce less legal clarity. Further, the judicial review before EU courts of this instrument is very likely to result in the introduction of additional regulatory layers, in order to reconcile the NCT with the \u2018ordinary\u2019 EU competition law framework.We also draw attention to the fact that, in contrast to existing EU competition rules, intervention addressing \u2018tipping market\u2019 problems would be based on market assessment detached from deliberate actions\/events, thus involving a degree of arbitrariness.On the basis of considerations set out in Vinted\u2019s answer to question No 17.1, Vinted reiterates its position that Articles 101 \/ 102 TFEU are sufficient to address competition issues related to \u2018tipping markets\u2019. ","2803":"Based on our understanding, the vague rationale behind intervention whose object is to prevent \u2018tipping markets\u2019, as a method to spur competitive process, resonates with the rationale behind Article 102 TFEU, which protects consumers from the effect of unilateral behaviour of market power wielding firms aimed at anticompetitive foreclosure \/ elimination of competitors or abusive exploitation of market power, resulting in negative effect on consumer welfare.","2804":"However, we draw attention to the fact that there appears to be stark differences in terms of stated policy objectives between NCT and Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. Whereas protection consumer welfare appears to be at the epicentre of contemporary EU competition law, IIA states \u201cfair and undistorted competition\u201d as the goal for NCT. While it remains to be seen, if these goals are compatible, at this point there is no clear demarcation of when and under what circumstances the European Commission suggests that it should have the powers to intervene and thus prevent \u2018tipping market\u2019.","2805":"In case the European Commission arrives at the conclusion that the new ex ante regulation originating from NCT consultation is necessary, Vinted would encourage limiting the scope of such regulation on sector-to-sector basis so that the broad online marketplaces and online classified ads platforms sector \/ market would be left out.","2806":"As a result, at present Vinted does not identify any particular national market where any market operator(s) would possess market power to the extent that such market would be characterised as a \u2018tipping market\u2019. Hence, there is hardly any evidence to support a need for new ex ante regulation addressed to online marketplaces or online classified ads with an objective to prevent \u2018tipping markets\u2019 from materializing.  ","2807":"Rather than introducing an NCT, which could, as already discussed, create a plethora of issues, we urge the European Commission to consider more efficient use of existing tools, namely Article 102 TFEU, to address issues relating to \u2018tipping markets\u2019. Vinted believes that coupled with more efficient case-management, streamlining of operations and timely intervention, Article 102 TFEU gives the European Commission sufficient legal power to preserve and improve the competitive structure of markets, whilst not intervening to the point of diverting the natural course of the market.We observe that in the digital sector, there are particular services rendered only by a few companies \/ platforms capturing the majority of traffic and user generated content in the area of social networks, online search, online video sharing \/ streaming, digital advertising and related services. Owing to the fact that such platforms capture most of the traffic and user-generated content, users also spend a lot of time in respective ecosystems originating from \u2018anchor\u2019 services interconnected by what the European Commission suggests to call a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019. ","2808":"The importance of digital services could be illustrated by reference to digital advertising. Different from TV \/ print, or any other non-digital forms of advertising, we observe that digital advertising allows us to measure our advertising effort, change advertising campaigns in real-time and, more importantly, users are usually actively searching for specific services \/ products or actively engage with advertising content.Vinted would have wanted to press \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d as an option but also to add some explanations.  As there was no option for additional explanations when pressing \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d, Vinted pressed \u201cyes\u201d to provide the explanation why we choose \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d option.","2809":"Although it is possible to recognize the \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 concept in non-digital advertising or other non-digital areas, at present Vinted has no sufficient information on other sectors or markets, to be able to identify particular sectors \/ markets as being exposed to \u2018gatekeepers\u2019.From Vinted\u2019s experience in e-commerce and the European Commission suggested features of a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 under question No 18 above, in business terms a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 could be any business partner having access to a large and important audience and input (e.g. payments, shipping, IT infrastructure, etc.). For this reason, any important business partner providing service \/ product, which is hard to be replaced without a negative financial, service quality, or mere time resources implications on our service could be perceived to be a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019.","2810":"However, from a legal perspective, we understand that a business partner\u2019s importance to another economic operator is a relative factor, i.e. we doubt if this category could be objective enough to become a legal category. Indeed, the ability to resort to alternatives, the ability to manage business partner risk and the overall diversification requires management effort. From this perspective, similar competing firms may have different ability to switch, not because of market realities, but because of investments (in terms of time, infrastructure, etc.) made to address business partner risks.Vinted is focused on e-commerce in the second-hand fashion category and in this category we do not observe any firms possessing \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 features.Vinted would have wanted to press \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d as an option but also to add some explanations.  As there was no option for additional explanations when pressing \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d, Vinted pressed \u201cyes\u201d to provide the explanation why we choose \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d option.","2811":"The existing regulation, in form of Article 102 TFEU, has sufficient legal power to prevent anti-competitive outcomes arising in connection with \u2018gatekeeper scenarios\u2019. European Commission has no lack of legal competence to intervene and enforce Article 102 TFEU in a wide variety of situations, which involves the use of market power geared towards foreclosure or elimination of competitors or distortion of competition conditions. This means that the European Commission already in its \u2018toolbox\u2019 has instruments which are capable of addressing anti-competitive behaviour (which also mean market failure). Thus,  objectively, there is no extra \u2018need\u2019 for the European Commission to have any additional tools to meaningfully address anti-competitive outcomes arising from \u2018gatekeeper scenarios\u2019. ","2812":"We are strong believers in the existing EU competition law framework. While attempting to realistically assess NCT, we understand that such novel regulation would inevitably introduce less legal clarity and, furthermore, the judicial review before EU courts of such instrument is very likely to introduce additional regulatory layers in order to reconcile NCT with \u2018ordinary\u2019 EU competition law framework.Since the concept of \u2018gatekeeper scenarios\u2019 could be distinguished as relating only to the use of market power, in this sense we understand that NCT essentially attempts to extend the scope of Article 102 TFEU beyond the abuse of dominance.","2813":"Based on our understanding, the rationale to intervene against \u2018gatekeeper platforms\u2019, based on their importance and the need to protect non-discriminatory access to these platforms, replicates the rationale behind Article 102 TFEU, which protects consumers from the effect of unilateral behaviour of market power wielding firms aimed at anticompetitive foreclosure \/ elimination of competitors or abusive exploitation of market power, resulting in negative effect on consumer welfare.","2814":"On the basis of considerations stated in the answer to question No 19.1 above, we suggest as a more rational course of action, to increase Article 102 TFEU enforcement. Adoption of such an approach would ultimately result in balancing the need for better economic outcomes for consumers against the need to ensure legal certainty and preserve market-based incentives to stimulate innovation.","2815":"Our suggestion would help to avoid less than optimal allocation of limited resources of the European Commission. As with any other new regulation, significant effort is necessary to shape the NCT idea into actual regulation and afterwards test it before EU courts, all of which could result in an unpredictable outcome.","2816":"As a result, at present Vinted does not identify any particular national market where any market operator would possess market power and thus could be characterised as a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019. Hence, there is hardly any evidence to support a need for new ex ante regulation addressed to online marketplaces or online classified ads with an objective to prevent \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 from engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.Vinted would have wanted to press \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d as an option but also to add some explanations.  As there was no option for additional explanations when pressing \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d, Vinted pressed the first option to provide the explanation why we choose \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d option.","2817":"As a result, at present Vinted does not identify any particular national market where the market characteristics would expose Vinted \/ other market players to genuine competition problems. To the contrary, the new regulation based on NCT could render the competition among market players less intense, because the constraints imposed on market leaders reduce incentives for new market players to attempt in challenging market leaders and thus generate benefits arising from market benefits.","2818":"Taking into account the definitions provided by the European Commission, we understand that \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 originate from the use of market power which, due to the market features, enable leading market players to entrench their position. In this light, competition problems arising from unilateral behaviour of firms in the market should be distinguished from artificial market power creation through cartels \/ agreement \/ concerted actions.","2819":"Often cartel infringements are distinguished as \u2018by object\u2019 infringements, which do not require proving anti-competitive effects, therefore the application of Article 101 TFEU is not specifically designed to address genuine structural competition problems. However, in relation to pan-industry \/ pan-market infringements, as a side-effect, the application of Article 101 TFEU may facilitate \/ help resolve structural competition problems in case parties to infringement terminate their behaviour which could otherwise have contributed to creation \/ preserving structural competition problems.","2820":"Regarding the highlighted need to address structural competition problems, please see Vinted answer No 6 above.Vinted has not identified the market situations and problematic conducts which prevent, restrict or distort competition and which could not be effectively addressed by existing EU competition rules, including Article 101 TFEU.Vinted believes that Article 102 TFEU is a legally effective and sufficient tool which can be used to address any competition problems arising in markets. As Article 102 TFEU prohibits any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position, this regulation catches what the European Commission calls \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems, when they rise to the severity, in terms of anti-competitive economic effects, that actually calls for intervention.","2821":"From a legal perspective, Article 102 TFEU, together with years of CJEU jurisprudence, has an established and defined framework, which is targeted at protection of consumer welfare what, in turn, enables Article 102 TFEU to limit regulatory intervention only to expressed anti-competitive conduct. As a result, Article 102 TFEU allows to avoid unwarranted intervention into natural market development.","2822":"Please also see answer to question No 6 above.Not applicable.Vinted believes that there is no need for a new competition tool to deal with what the European Commission calls \u2018structural competition problems\u2019. We take this position because (i) we believe the described \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 often do not rise to the level that necessitates regulatory intervention and (ii) when these problems genuinely rise to the level that they give rise to anti-competitive outcomes, this virtually always constitutes an abuse of a dominant position or restriction of competition which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition, and thus, actions which are caught under Articles 101 \/ 102 TFEU or in the case of a merger which is liable to create a significant impediment to effective competition \u2013 the EU Merger Regulation.","2823":"First, in relation to point (i), Vinted has given its view on the issues that the European Commission believes qualify as \u2018structural competition problems\u2019 in its answer to question No 7. In short, in our view, the various competition issues that the NCT seeks to address, do not exist in markets to the level which merits legal intervention on the basis of introduction and afterwards enforcement of ex ante regulatory regime. This can be illustrated by various examples that the NCT focuses on, namely: \u2018gap cases\u2019, \u2018tipping markets\u2019 and \u2018gatekeeper scenarios\u2019. ","2824":"The NCT has a heavy focus on addressing the \u2018enforcement gap\u2019 or \u2018gap cases\u2019 that, in the European Commission\u2019s view, cannot be addressed by Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. However, as admitted by the Commission in the IIA and highlighted by Vinted in previous answers, there is no clear consensus over whether such \u2018gap cases\u2019, that cannot be addressed by the efficient use of current competition tools, exist at all. ","2825":"A similar issue arises with the notion of \u2018tipping\u2019 markets. Again, the NCT focuses on addressing the phenomenon of \u2018tipping\u2019 markets, but artificial intervention against \u2018tipping\u2019 could stifle growth, as intervention would most likely hinder the organic growth of companies \/ markets. This creates a scenario where a competition policy generates a negative net anti-competitive outcome.","2826":"The examples discussed in answers above show that the issues that the European Commission identifies as \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems do not actually rise to the level of severity as to actually give rise to anticompetitive results in a market which could not be rectified by natural market development. Even further, many of these \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems appear to be based on characterisation of natural market phases as being \u2018problematic\u2019. Therefore, Vinted believes that until the European Commission clearly identifies competition issues that rise to the level of such severity, to be classed as \u2018structural\u2019 competition issues, a new competition tool should not be introduced.Continuing our answer to question No 24.1., Vinted supports the efficient and timely usage of existing competition tools, namely Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and the EU Merger Regulation, to address any competition problems in markets.  In relation to point (ii) raised in answer to question No 24.1., when and if the \u2018structural\u2019 competition problems, listed above and in the IIA, rise to such a level of severity that they actually generate anti-competitive market outcomes, such behaviour will be caught under Articles 101 \/ 102 TFEU or the EU Merger Regulation, without risking irreparable harm to natural market development.","2827":"Vinted holds the view that ex ante rules are designed to address well-defined, clear and recurring issues in specific already developed sectors (i.e. telecoms, energy, transport, banking, etc). Since the New Competition Tool (\u201cNCT\u201d) focuses on issues which have not been under scrutiny of EU competition rules, such as structural competition problems, the role of \u2018gatekeepers\u2019, etc., these issues also have not been scrutinised by EU courts. For these reasons, it is especially difficult to define well-grounded, clear and exhaustive ex ante rules. ","2828":"Specifically, in relation to early intervention, inability to impose clear rules in relation to structural problems may be illustrated by reference to \u2018tipping\u2019. There is no exact point \/ date at which it could be stated that \u2018tipping\u2019 took place. Until \u2018tipping\u2019 has occurred, there appears to be no credible economic rationale for intervention. Indeed, pre-\u2018tipping\u2019 intervention by introduction of \u2018tipping\u2019-preventive measures would, in fact, mean supporting less efficient market operators.","2829":"Vinted is dedicated to long-term progress of the market and long-term value maximisation for consumers, rather than short-term profits. Therefore, we firmly believe that, on balance, regulatory intervention aimed at what may be perceived as \u2018structural competition problems\u2019, on the basis of ex ante rules, would be unwarranted and the net effect of such interventions may negatively affect innovation and market development.As discussed above, Vinted does not see a need or a sufficient justification for the introduction of the NCT, as we believe any current competition problems that arise in markets can be remedied by the efficient and timely use of existing competition tools \u2013 Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.","2830":"However, if the European Commission was to decide that this new competition tool is needed, we urge the European Commission to limit the tool\u2019s scope to only cover the conduct of dominant companies in specific sectors \/ markets which are characterised by structural competition problems, such as markets with a monopoly and high entry barriers (naturally, as we understand, in this case the NCT would not cover the second-hand clothing e-commerce market that Vinted operates in because dominance-related concerns are not characteristic to this market). As discussed to a further extent in our answers to questions Nos 12.2. and 42, the online second-hand fashion segment is a very dynamic, competitive and growing segment which enables vibrant competition between different business models and many players. ","2831":"The NCT\u2019s objective, as stated by the European Commission in the IIA, is to \u201censure fair and undistorted competition in the internal market\u201d. The NCT, if enacted, should not cover the online second-hand fashion segment, as this market does not possess features which would allow the sector to be characterised as being \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cdistorted\u201d, i.e. what the NCT seeks to remedy.","2832":"Although Vinted does not support the introduction of a new competition tool for reasons extensively stated above, if the European Commission was to adopt this initiative, Vinted would urge the European Commission to ensure that the tool is limited in scope to specific sectors \/ markets, where structural competition problems are the most prevalent and \/ or most unlikely to be remedied by innovation.","2833":"As discussed to a further extent in our answers to questions No 12.2. and 42, Vinted would like to restate that the online second-hand fashion segment is a very dynamic, competitive and growing segment which enables vibrant competition between different business models and many players. Even the same format platforms have unique features and distinct value propositions.","2834":"Vinted contends that the scope of the NCT should be limited to markets \/ sectors that are not characterised by dynamic competition. As the general objective of the NCT, as stated in the IIA, is to \u201censure fair and undistorted competition in the internal market\u201d, Vinted believes it would not make sense to apply the NCT to markets with dynamic competition, where no or little structural competition problems exist. ","2835":"Therefore, naturally, as discussed in the answer above and answers to questions No 12.2 and 42, Vinted reasserts that the online second-hand fashion segment is a very dynamic, competitive and growing segment. Thus, it would not make sense to apply the NCT to the online second-hand fashion segment and similar segments, where dynamic competition exists.Vinted would have wanted to press \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d as an option but also to add some explanations.  As there was no option for additional explanations when pressing \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d, Vinted pressed \u201cno\u201d to provide the explanation why we choose \u201cnot applicable\/no relevant experience\u201d option.","2836":"Vinted believes that competition issues can arise in various markets \/ sectors, regardless of whether they are affected by digitisation or not. However, it is important to note that competition policy experience shows that most markets up to now (except natural monopolies with high barriers to entry) have functioned and developed naturally well, without any need for ex ante regulation. Therefore, Vinted does not see any reason why this cannot be the case moving forward and why there is this perceived need for ex ante regulation by the European Commission.","2837":"However, if the European Commission were to decide to enact the NCT, Vinted urges the European Commission to ensure this tool is limited in scope. As the objective of the NCT is to ensure undistorted competition, Vinted believes the application of the NCT should be limited to markets with a natural monopoly, high entry barriers and little probability of new entry in the short-term, regardless of whether this market is affected by digitisation or not.Vinted is against NCT, including granting the enforcement body with the powers mentioned above.See answers above.","2838":"If the NCT was to be adopted, Vinted believes there must be clear legal deadlines for the usage of the tool that are binding upon the European Commission. This would ensure that companies, operating in the European Union, have greater legal certainty regarding the NCT and its applications.Vinted strongly opposes the possibility to impose interim measures under the NCT. The NCT, as currently defined by the European Commission in its IIA, already has an expansive scope, allowing for the imposition of remedies without any prior finding of wrongdoing by undertakings. In light of the NCT\u2019s proposed expansive scope, it is crucial the European Commission ensures procedural fairness and appropriate safeguards for companies that operate in the Single Market and could be subject to this new tool. Therefore, no remedies or even interim measures should be imposed without a thorough analysis of the relevant market and a final conclusion on the findings of the investigation.In case the European Commission adopts NCT, the possibility to accept voluntary commitments by the companies operating in the markets under investigation, would allow to find most optimal solutions tailored to the competition problems and the market realities \u2018on the ground\u2019, thus ensuring the least negative effect on the healthy aspects of the market environment.Vinted maintains that companies operating in the markets concerned, suppliers and customers should have the possibility to comment on the findings of the European Commission before the final decision. ","2839":"Although Vinted opposes the introduction of the NCT, if this tool was to be enacted, it is important that the market investigations conducted through it are as thorough and accurate as possible. This is especially important in light of the proposed expansive scope of the NCT, which allows the European Commission to impose remedies without any finding of wrongdoing by a company. We believe the comments of other companies, suppliers and consumers would help the European Commission to ensure, as much as possible, that the findings of the investigation are accurate, and no companies suffer from inaccurate findings and inappropriately imposed remedies, without having infringed any competition rules.Vinted maintains that companies operating in the markets concerned, suppliers and customers should have the possibility to comment on the appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies by the European Commission.","2840":"Vinted wishes to reiterate that it opposes the introduction of the NCT. However, in the event that the European Commission deems it is necessary to adopt the NCT, we believe it is crucial to keep the expansive scope of the proposed tool in mind whilst deciding what remedies should be imposed, and how they should be imposed. As the NCT would allow the Commission to impose remedies that affect companies operating in a relevant sector without any finding of a breach of competition rules by the said companies, the remedies imposed should be absolutely necessary, proportionate and designed to address competition issues in markets without destroying the natural course of development of the market, in order to be appropriate. Vinted believes this could be best achieved through consulting other companies, suppliers and consumers on the appropriateness and proportionality of the proposed remedies.In the event the NCT is adopted, Vinted would welcome the introduction of adequate procedural safeguards, including judicial review. The procedural safeguards and judicial review should ensure the protection of personal and individual human rights, access to legal and judicial remedies \u2013 all imperative to ensuring the rule of law and overall legal transparency and clarity in any given market.","2841":"As discussed in questions above, the expansive scope of the proposed NCT means it is imperative that there are appropriate checks and balances that ensure the procedural propriety of the market investigations conducted through the NCT. Unfortunately, the IIA makes no mention of any procedural safeguards to be imposed alongside the NCT. Therefore, Vinted urges the European Commission to consider how it will ensure procedural fairness and access to judicial review.","2842":"Vinted takes the view that the NCT framework must set out clear provisions guaranteeing a fair process which safeguards companies\u2019 right of defence and appeal rights, as this is currently not found in the IIA. In this context, the United Kingdom Market Investigation regime should be considered as a \u2018blueprint\u2019.Vinted does not see sufficient economic and legal grounds to justify the introduction of NCT.","2843":"In case the European Commission arrives at conclusion that the new ex ante regulation originating from NCT consultation is necessary, Vinted would encourage limiting the scope of such regulation on sector-to-sector basis so that the broad online marketplaces and online classified ads platforms sector \/ market would be left out.","2844":"The Federation of Finnish Enterprises is the largest and most influental federation in Finland. Today our membership consist approximately 115,000 SMEs representing different fields of business. FFE plays an active role in improving the environment where small and medium-sized enterprises operate in. We also provide information to the public to help influence opinions and raise public awareness of entrepreneurship in Finland.","2845":"The existence of these above elements does not always indicate a structural competition problem. As these elements could be a part of a structural competition problem, there might be other countervailing elements that allows the proper fuction of the markets. It is also possible that these elements are temporary and will dissapear within certain period of time. It must therefore be borne in mind that the markets can remedy itself - at least from time to time - and intervention is not always necessary. For example, the mere fact that there are few players on the market (element A) does not as such mean that a structural market failure is imminent if new entrants are likely to enter the market within a certain period of time. However it must be stated that when several of these elements are present in the market concerned, the more likely it is that there is or will be a structural competition problem in the market.\nIn our view, the most serious structural competition problems relate to situations where only one or few major market player distorts the competition on the market by placing its competitors at a disadvantage. When such market player has acquired sufficient market power it can act independently of its competitors and define market dynamics for all market players. Competitors must therefore act on the terms of that economic operator. The situation may also mean that once this economic operator has achieved this position, the competitors will no longer be possible to challenge it. Achieving such a position may be faster in the digital markets. ","2846":"The markets are digitalized at a rapid pace and this pace has been accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis. It is therefore important to pay attention to all the factors that hinder the SMEs possibility to enter the digital market and their potential to reap the benefits it brings. More effort in needed to improve SMEs participation in the digital trade.","2847":"Experience has shown that tipping or winner takes most -markets emerge in a platform economy where a few leading players can dominate entire global markets. The platforms can be, for example, platforms for online advertising, marketplaces, operating systems or search engines. The phenomena of market tipping to a single player is due to the global nature of the platforms and their inherent lock-in and network effects.The benefits of network effects production are typical for tipping markets. As a new user adds value to the network to other users, new users are increasingly likely to join as the network grows. Once the platform has reached the optimal scale, it may be impossible for the competing platforms it to compete with it. This may ultimately lead to market foreclosure. Once the platform has acquired this position it may control the playing field to a significant extent and may use the market it controls to expand and strengthen to other areas or to make its dominant position more permanent.The phenomenon of tipping markets occurs especially in the platform economy. However, predicting this phenomenon in advance may not always be straightforward. There are examples in the platform economy where platforms can thrive at the same time, as well as examples where the market has tippet in favor of one player. In general, it can be stated that different customer needs can prevent markets from tipping.If the tipping phenomenon is accompanied by foreclosure and customer lock-in strategies, there is a risk that effective competitors will have to leave the market. As one player embraces substansial part of market for itself, incentives to innovate may decrease. As the competition decreases so does the customers options which allows the company to raise its prices.","2848":"As dominance or the acquisition of a dominant position is not in itself prohibited, competition law cannot effectively address the problem of tipping markets. Under the current means, intervention is only possible on an ex post basis if the dominant undertaking abuses its position. \nGatekeeper scenarios are particularly evident in the platform economy. This is due to factors specific to the platform economy, such as strong network effects and the important role of data.","2849":"Usually the Gatekeeper does not have a real competitor and is able to foreclose other competing platforms from the market (4). Gatekeeper scenarios are also featured by enhanced dependency (4) since such large online platforms has large user base and connects many businesses and consumers. It is also typical  that the gatekeeperes have substantial data assets which they can take advantage of as they spread to new areas of activity (4).Due to its wide geographical coverage, the gatekeeper can determine the market dynamics in a significant area. Bargaining power imbalance between the user ja the gatekeeper may lead to a situation where the users (businesses and consumers) have to accept unfavourable contractual conditions defined by the online platforms. \nIt is important that the markets remain fair and contestable for innovators, businesses, and new market entrants and this requires that the gatekeeper scenarios are addressed.Addressing gatekeeper scenarios that raise competition concerns could be in some cases possible under Article 102. The prohibition of the abuse of a dominant position means an ex post intervention. This is insufficient in a situation where there is risk that the economic operator will achieve dominant position but has not yet achieved it. The concepts of dominance and gatekeeper are close to each other, which is why the relationship between these should be further clarified.","2850":"Much can already be achieved with the right targeting of the existing competition law. Competition law is intended to be flexible and has in the past been able to adapt to changes in the economy and markets. Flexible competition law is a better option than  additional regulation, which should always be complemented as markets evolve and change. Dynamic markets, especially digital markets, reformes at a rapid pace, which means that new regulation may no longer be effective as markets reform. However, it is true that it may not be possible to address all structural competition problems effectively with existing competition law tools. The biggest concern seems to be the incapability to early intervention.-The rapid digitalization of the economy and markets creates new risks to effective competition. In the digital market network effects can lead to a few top players dominating the entire market. Today\u2019s competition law tools seems to be in some cases too limited to deal with structural competition problems at least effectively or in a timely manner. The biggest concern seems to be that as the existing tools do not always allow timely intervention this may lead to distortions of competition which are difficult or even impossible to remedy.In practice it is very difficult to predict and assess the emergence of a potential structural competition problem in the markets concerned. Intervention at the earliest possible stage is, in principle favorable. It can prevent market failures from ever materializing and thus ensure that healthy competition is maintained and prevent adverse effects in the market. However, there are certain problems with early intervention. First, it would be difficult to determine when the intervention threshold would be met in a way that the intervention under new competition tool would be justified. In addition, it is difficult to predict market developments exhaustively. The possibility of an erroneous intervention should be identified. ","2851":"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to maintain competition in the market. There is a risk that a tool that would be applied too widely will jeopardize legal certainty and predictability. The use of the tool should therefore be limited to what is necessary and should be proportionate to the objectives pursued. Limited scope based on dominance would increase legal certainty and predictability, since companies could assess whether they are dominant and thus potentially the target of an intervention. Market structure-based competition tool could have detrimental effects on incentive towards innovation and investment due to the uncertainty caused by the wide scope.","2852":"The new the competition tool should have a clear scope and it should focus on areas where competition concerns have been identified. As this would mean a new type of ex ante intervention in competition law, it is appropriate to limit its use, at least as a first stage, to sectors where competition problems have arisen. Extending the use of the tool should be considered at a later stage, once there is more evidence of its impact to the market.","2853":"Imposing remedies should always be a last resort, and limited only to situations where a structural competition problems causes significant disturbances in the market. There should be clear criteria for imposing remedies, that would ensure legal certainty for companies.Structural remedies constitute a drastic intervention in an activity which does not as such infringe the rules of competition law. The imposition of structural remedies should be a last resort and should always be based on careful investigation. The emphasis should remain on the use of existing competition law tools. A possible new competition tool should therefore complement the existing competition law.","2854":"Allowing voluntary commitments by companies is important in order to implement the principle of proportionality. It is in the interest of market participants to seek redress through voluntary measures, before resorting to more drastic interventions, as voluntary commitments can  limit unnecessary harm to the company. Volutary commitments can also help to achieve faster results in the market. Keeping in mind that the aim is to eliminate a structural competition problem and not to punish an established infringement, avoiding additional harm should be the main approach principle.","2855":"The new competition tool would allow remedies to be imposed without a finding of an infringement and thus differs significantly from the current approach of competition law. Therefore it is particularly important that the tool is accompanied by appropriate safeguards, rights of defense and due process.The ex-ante instrument and the New Competition Tool intents to achieve very similar objectives. It would therefore be necessary to examine whether two separate legislative instruments are necessary. Overlapping to existing competition tools and ex-ante regulation under consideration should be avoided in order to achieve the objectives of better regulation.","2856":"Confederation  of  Finnish  Industries  (EK)  is  the  leading  business  organisation  in \nFinland.

","2858":"EK supports the protection and promotion of effective competition in all markets. For \nthe sake of European economy, effective competition and level playing field within \nthe internal market must be safeguarded. Realistic market access must be ensured \nand  new  entrants  must  be  able  to  operate  in  the  market  without  the  risk  of  being \nhampered by market players distorting competition. EK therefore  understands and \nsupports  the  Commission's  aim  to  address  all  harmful  competition  problems. \nHowever, EK emphasizes that the problems related to alleged structural competition \nproblems  should  not  be  addressed  hastily  or  in  a  fragmented  manner.  When \nconsidering instruments to address specific competition concerns, it is important to \nfirst evaluate and define thoroughly the nature and effects of the alleged problems in \nrelevant  markets.  Following  this  assessment,  the  Commission's  various  regulatory \nproposals and their effects should be considered as an ensemble. Increase in ad hoc \nregulation can be a threat to the coherent, fair and effective application of competition \nrules and thus, to the level playing field.  ","2859":"EK  is  concerned  that  the  Commission  is  currently  considering  several  proposals \nlinked  either  directly  or  indirectly  with  competition  law.  Thus,  it  is  challenging  to \nevaluate  in  advance  the  combined  effect  of  all  proposals  to  market  operators.  In \naddition to the proposed new competition tool, the Commission is currently evaluating \nthe need for a new ex ante -regulatory framework regarding large online platforms as \nwell  as  reviewing  the  market  definition  notice.  In  the  field  of  industrial  policy  the \nrecently published White Paper on Foreign Subsidies contains elements referring to \ncompetition  law.  In  addition  to  the  ongoing  consultations,  the  ECN  +  Directive \n(2019\/1)  promoting  effective  enforcement  of  competition  law  is  currently  being \nimplemented in the Member States.

","2860":"The  current  competition  regime  has  been  established  over  decades.  The  ground \nrules of the current competition regime have proved their worth and are applicable \nas such in different markets. Thus, a potential reform of established competition rules \nor  increase  in  regulation,  must  be  approached  with  caution.  In  EK's  view,  the \nstructural competition concerns raised by the Commission can be largely addressed \nby the current rules and, if needed, by updated or new sector-specific guidelines or \nnotices  given  by  competent  authorities.  EK  underlines  that  the  growth  potential  of \nEuropean companies should not be unduly restricted by reforms which unnecessarily \ntighten current regulations. However, we find it equally important to protect especially \nSMEs against unfair competition. ","2861":"In all options of the Commission's proposal for a new competition tool, the discretion \nand  competence  of  competition  authorities  increase  significantly.  To  balance  this, \nappropriate and effective legal measures are needed to protect those operators who \nwould be subject to the use of the competition tool. In this respect, the Commission's \nproposal is incomplete and needs to be clarified. We underline that the content and \nlimits  of  the  competition  authorities'  discretion  and  powers  should  be  defined  in \nadvance  in  a  transparent  and  clear  manner.  The  term  \"structural  competition \nproblem\"  and  the  criteria  for  identifying  these  kinds  of  problems  need  also  to  be \ndefined. In addition, all corrective measures should be proportionate  and their use \nshould be based on a thorough economic analysis. EK is especially critical of the use \nof  structural  remedies  in  situations  which  would  not  require  a  finding  of  an  actual \ninfringement.  Structural  remedies  have  far-reaching  consequences  from  the \ncompanies'  point  of  view  and  an  appropriate  appeal  process  must  be  ensured.  In \npractice an appeal process would delay the use of the competition tool and thus, it \nwould not be a quick-fix to the structural competition problems. EK therefore invites \nthe  Commission  to  consider  more  thoroughly  the  appropriateness  of  structural \nremedies as a corrective measure.   ","2862":"EK welcomes the idea that the use of the competition tool would be based on a proper \nmarket functioning test. However, the proposal is unclear about the contents of the \ntest and whether the results of the ongoing market definition consultation will be taken \ninto account in further consideration regarding the proposed competition tool. At a \ngeneral level, EK states that the test must be realistic, transparent, predictable and \ntake into account the characteristics of the market in question. A thorough economic \nanalysis is an essential part of the test as well as a detailed market investigation.  It \nis important that companies are able to evaluate in advance the scope of application \nof the competition tool. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that all markets are \ndifferent  and  it  would  be  challenging  to  create  a  tool  which  would  be  applicable \nhorizontally without problems. ","2863":"EK  understands  that  there  may  be  a need  for  a  new  competition  tool  in  situations \nwhere effective competition is limited, but the situation cannot, for some reason, be \naddressed  by  existing  competition  rules.  However,  it  should  be  examined  further \nwhether  there  really  are  potential  gaps  in  existing  competition  rules.  The \nCommission's current proposal regarding the new competition tool is not sufficiently \nthorough in this respect. The proposal needs to be defined more clearly as all risks \nto  legal  security,  coherent  and  equal  application  must  be  avoided.  EK  therefore \nencourages the Commission to further explore the need for a new competition tool \nand  to  pay  particular  attention  to  at  least  the  following  issues  in  its  further \npreparations: ","2864":"b.  It is important to maintain in force the existing, well established competition \nrules  and  principles.

The  Commission  should \nproduce  a  definition  of  Systemic  Digital  Platforms  that  is  neither  under-  nor  over-\ninclusive, i.e. that captures those (but only those) platforms whose systemic role in the \ndigital economy is such that their conduct threatens the fairness and openness of EU \nmarkets,  without \nimposing  unnecessary  regulatory  burdens  on  other  market \nparticipants.

Instead  of  laying  down  highly  detailed  and \nprescriptive  rules,  the ex ante  regulation  should  set  out  core  principles,  which  are \nfleshed out in an accompanying guidance paper and further developed through the \nenforcement  process.  More  specifically,  we  believe  that  these  principles  should \naddress several practices that are particularly detrimental to the travel industry and \nwhich  may  also  affect  other  industries,  including  the  ability  of  Systemic  Digital \nPlatforms  to:  (i)  engage  in  self-preferencing,  e.g.  when  Google  discounts  organic \nsearch results in favor of its own products or advertising; (ii) internal combine and use \ndata across products and services; (iii) impede multi-homing to entrench the Systemic \nDigital Platform\u2019s position by \u201clocking in\u201d users and erecting barriers to entry.

","2878":"Enforcement of the ex ante rules. Enforcement could be based on a system of parallel \ncompetences between the Commission and national authorities, drawing inspiration \nfrom the mechanism in place for the enforcement of EU competition law according to \nRegulation 1\/2003. Were similar principles to govern the enforcement of ex ante rules, \nwe would typically expect the Commission to be the authority \u201cwell placed to act\u201d, as \nthe practices of large digital platforms are usually cross-border in nature and affect \nseveral Member States at once. The competent authority should be vested with the \npower to take all necessary measures to ensure the effet utile of the ex ante rules, lest \nwe end up with toothless regulation. ","2879":"Digitization  has  changed  profoundly  the  way  people  live,  communicate  with  each \nother  and  travel.  For  instance,  digitization  has  seen  the  rise  of  certain  large  digital \nplatforms that intermediate between a variety of businesses and consumers. This has \ngiven rise to new dynamics and in some cases new competitive challenges.  Protected \nby significant  barriers to entry (strong  network  effects and  economies of scale  and \nscope,  marginal  costs  often  close  to  zero,  primarily  single-homing  customers,  wide \naccess to competitively relevant data, etc.),3 a small subset of platforms have become \n\u201cdigital gatekeepers\u201d to markets, customers and information, thus putting in danger \nthe fairness and openness of EU markets.4 There is already evidence of how Systemic \nDigital  Platforms  can  use  their  systemic  role  to  cement  their  market  power  and \nleverage it into new markets, as well as to impose unfair conditions on their business \ncustomers (e.g., excessive data extraction). Once a market has tipped in their favor, it \nbecomes extremely difficult  for both existing rivals and new entrants to compete. This \nstifles innovation and harms consumers. ","2880":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe travel sector is no exception, as it has grown heavily dependent on \u2013 and exposed \nto the problematic conduct of \u2013 one of these gatekeepers, namely Google, on which \nthis  paper  will  focus.  Yet,  our  concerns  are  far  from  being  specific  to  the  travel \nindustry.  Indeed,  similar  concerns  about  Google\u2019s  conduct  have  been  voiced  by \ncompanies operating in many other sectors (e.g., comparison shopping services, news \npublishing, etc.). This serves to illustrate how the issues posed by Google\u2019s conduct are \nat  their  core systemic  and structural:  they  stem  from  Google\u2019s  abuse  of  its  quasi-\nmonopoly in general search (and related advertising), which act as a gateway for user \ntraffic to online businesses. ","2881":"At the same time, our concerns are not necessarily limited to Google. Rather, Google\u2019s \npractices  should  be  regarded  as  examples  of  how  a  large  tech  firm  may  use  its \ngatekeeping role to gain anticompetitive advantage in new markets and\/or entrench \nits  position  on  existing  markets.  Indeed,  companies  in  similar  gatekeeping  positions \nengage  in  similar  practices.  For  this  reason, ex ante  regulation  should  not  refer  to \nnamed undertakings, but should focus on the conduct of gatekeepers that threaten \nthe openness and fairness of EU markets. ","2882":"The  Commission  is  well  aware  of  Google\u2019s  quasi-monopoly  over  general  search:  at \nleast since 2008, Google has consistently held remarkably high market shares across \nall  27  EU  Member  States,  in  most  cases  exceeding  90%,  while  no  effective  entry  has \ntaken  place.5  Coupled  with  strong  barriers  to  entry  such  as  network  effects, \neconomies  of  scale,  access  to  click-and-query  data,  and  the  need  for  significant \ninvestments,6  this  means  that  Google\u2019s  position  is  virtually  incontestable.  That  has \nenabled Google to become the gatekeeper of user traffic flowing through its search \nengine. ","2883":"Naturally, that has not left the travel sector unaffected. Like most online businesses, \nmany  OTAs  and  MSEs  \u2013  even  those  with  a  highly  recognizable  brand  and  a  strong \ndirect  relationship  with  consumers  \u2013  are  reliant  on  Google  for  a  material  portion  of \nuser traffic, be it organic or paid. In many cases, customers begin their journey with \nGoogle  Search.  This  control  of  the  top  of  the  customer  purchase  funnel  enables \nGoogle to act as  a  bottleneck,  by  e.g.,  diverting traffic from OTAs and MSEs into  its \nown vertical search products, to the detriment of OTAs and MSEs.  Indeed, Google has \nsystematically engaged in such practices in order to promote its own vertical travel \nproducts, namely Hotel Finder (accommodation), Google Flights (flights) and VR finder \n(vacation rentals).  ","2884":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFor  instance,  when  a  user  searches  for  a  hotel  in  Brussels,  Google  automatically \ndisplays the \u201cHotel search unit\u201d, a box with hotel listings that when clicked on leads \nthe user to Google\u2019s hotel vertical,7 see Figure 1. The Hotel search unit is prominently \nfeatured on Google\u2019s SERP with a rich and attractive display format, setting it apart \nfrom  rival  verticals  displayed  significantly  further  down  the  page,  below  \u201cthe  fold\u201d, \ndespite the fact that these rivals are highly ranked organic results. Over the years, the \nHotel  search  unit  has  captured  an  increasingly  large  portion  of  the  SERP,  pushing \norganic  results  ever  further  down  the  page  (and  below  the  fold).  If  the  search  is \nconducted  on  a  mobile  device  \u2013  as  is  increasingly  the  case  \u2013  where  screen  size  is \nlimited, the Hotel search unit will typically push organic results down so far that the \nuser will have to scroll down to find them. Yet the average user rarely scrolls down the \nSERP.  ","2885":"Even  when  a  user  clicks  on  a  listing  displayed  within  the  Hotel  search  unit,  Google \ninterposes itself between the OTA or MSE whose listing is clicked on and its customers. \nWhen  a  user  clicks  on  a  listing  in  the  Hotel  search  unit  display  (see  Figure  1),  he  is \nreferred  to  Google\u2019s  Hotel  Finder  vertical,  not  to  the  OTA  or  MSE  whose  listing  he \nselected,  see  Figure  2.    The  user  then  inputs  her  search  details  into  Google\u2019s  Hotel \nFinder  (e.g.,  dates,  star  rating,  budget,  services  such  as  Wi-Fi).  In  effect,  the  Hotel \nsearch  unit  that  is  displayed  on  the  SERP  (Figure  1)  is  a  \u201cbait  and  switch\u201d  \u2013  the  user \nthinks  that  he  will  be  taken  to  the  listing  he  clicks  on,  but  in  fact,  regardless  of  the \nlisting on which he clicks, he is taken to the Hotel Finder page (Figure 2).  ","2886":"Google  then  displays  the  offers  made  by  OTAs,  MSEs  and  hotels  that  have \nparticipated in the auction run by Google to populate its Hotel Finder results page, see \nFigure  3  (which  shows  the  screen  the  user  sees  when  it  clicks  on  one  of  the  hotels \nlisted). Only then will the customer be able to choose an OTA or MSE to complete her \nbooking. ","2887":"Consumers  are  thus  pushed  further  down  Google\u2019s  purchasing  funnel  before  they \ninteract with the OTA or MSE that they initially chose back on the SERP. This reduces, if \nnot eliminates, the ability of OTAs or MSEs to differentiate themselves other than on \nprice (as only their logo appears next to a price), stifling innovation, disincentivizing \ninvestments  in  quality  enhancements  and  harming  consumers.9  At  the  same  time, \nOTAs  and  MSEs  have  to  pay  significant  amounts  to  be  displayed  in  Google\u2019s  Hotel \nFinder results. In addition, to be able to participate in the Hotel Finder auction, OTAs \nand MSEs, hand over valuable data to Google, through a live feed, which Google uses \nto populate its Hotel Finder results.10 Google has not entered into contracts with tens \nof thousands of hotels and hotel chains in the way that OTAs have. ","2888":"10   This is a broader concern about Google, i.e. that it may collect through its various business-user services \n(e.g., advertising or analytics services) data not strictly necessary for the provision of its services, which \nit may then use to develop competing products.

While  initially \nthe  Commission  took  issue  with  Google  using  its  dominance  in  search  to  favor  a \nnumber  of  its  verticals,  including  travel,  it  eventually  only  addressed  one  of  the \naffected  verticals,  namely  comparison  shopping  services  in  the  case  AT.39740  \u2013 \nGoogle Search (Shopping).  In  the  meantime,  Google  has  been  free  to  engage  in \nabusive practices that are comparable to, and have created consumer harm of the \norder  of,  the  conduct  condemned  in Google Shopping in  order  to  favor  its  travel \nverticals.17 ","2896":"In the third place, even when lengthy investigations conclude, the remedies imposed \nmay do little to facilitate the restoration of competition. For example, rival comparison \nshopping  services  have  long  complained  that  the  remedy  implemented  in Google \nShopping has had little to no impact.18 In November 2019, more than two years after \nthe decision was adopted, Commissioner Vestager observed in an interview that the \nremedy generates \u201cvery little\u201d traffic to rivals.19 In the case of Google Android,20 rival \nsearch  engine DuckDuckGo  recently  criticized  the proposed auction-based  remedy \nfor  both  favoring  Google21  and  being  \u201crigged in favor of big companies and search \nengines with intentionally ad-heavy search results.\u201d22 ","2897":"17   For instance, in the case of Google Flights or Google Hotel Finder, there is a valid argument that Google \nhas engaged in an unlawful tie of its travel vertical to its general search services. Once the user enters a \ntravel-related query on Google Search, Google will automatically display its OneBox (e.g., Hotel search \nunit or Flights unit). There is no way for the user to access Google Search and avoid Google\u2019s verticals.  \n18   See  e.g.,  R.  Toplensky  and  M.

We  agree  that  the  regulation  should  cover  \u201conline platforms, i.e. digital \nservices that facilitate interactions via the Internet between two or more distinct but \ninterdependent sets of users\u201d,29  including  \u201conline marketplaces, app stores, search \nengines, social media and platforms for the collaborative economy.\u201d30 ","2912":"The  first  condition  requires  that  ex ante  regulation  should  only  capture  digital \nplatforms whose activities extends \u201cacross a significant part of the internal market\u201d, \nhence avoiding local actors from being caught by ex ante regulation.

That  is  the  case  when  one  user  group \n(typically consumers) single-homes, to the effect that the other user group (typically \nbusinesses)  relies  on  each  platform  with  single-homing  consumers  to  reach  those \nsingle-homers.36  ","2914":"Third,  this  position  can  also  enable  the  platform  to  control  access  to  users  in  an \nadjacent market (\u201cgatekeeper\u201d role), enabling it to charge a premium for such access \n(e.g., in the form of high fees or other onerous terms).37 They are also able to dictate \ntheir  rules  to  competitors  in  such  adjacent  markets,  which  are  dependent  on  their \nplatforms  to  reach  consumers,  hence  acting  as  private  regulators.

This  enables  the  digital  platform  to  rapidly  become  dominant  in  new \nmarkets,  while  at  the  same  time  entrenching  its  position  on  its  core(s)  market(s), \nreinforcing its gatekeeper role.38 ","2915":"36   See also Autoriteit & Consument Market, \u201cMarket study into mobile app stores\u201d, Report, 11 April 2019, \navailable  at  https:\/\/www.acm.nl\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/market-study-into-mobile-app-stores.pdf, \npage 56, describing how single-homing of one user group enables the platform to become a bottleneck \nfor  the  multi-homing  side:  \u201c[s]ingle-homing  and  a  lack  of  switching  opportunities  mean  consumers \ncannot effectively be reached by the multi-homing side in  any other way, and the platform becomes a \nbottleneck for reaching the single-homers.

The authority enforcing the rules could thus have regard to the fact that \nthe  platform  is  a  digital  gatekeeper,  which  can  act  as  a  private  regulator,  and \nleverage its market position into adjacent or other related markets, as well as other \nfactors  (such  as  the  digital  platforms\u2019  access  to  competitively  relevant  data,  its \nfinancial strength, etc.).39  ","2918":"We  note in this respect that the  ToR of the Impact Assessment Study mentions that \nthe authors of the study should elaborate a set of \u201cmainly quantitative indicators (and \nunderlying methodology for setting those) on the basis of platforms\u2019 characteristics \nsuch as number of unique users, number of visits, the amount of gathered data, time \nspent on the platform, network effects and drivers of growth, main source of income, \nmulti-platform  integration,  third  parties\u2019  turn-over  realised  on  a  platform  or \ngeographic coverage, number of transactions, etc.\u201d  While  we  believe  that  these \nquantitative criteria may play a role in identifying the platforms that should be subject \nto ex ante regulation, they should be combined with the qualitative criteria suggested \nabove.

That is in line \nwith the proposals in the Furman Report (whereby the proposed Digital Markets Unit \nwould have to first designate the companies holding \u201cstrategic market status\u201d), and \nthe  German  draft  bill  (whereby  the  Bundeskartellamt  would  have  to  first  issue  a \ndecision declaring that an undertaking is of \u201cparamount significance for competition \nacross markets\u201d).40 ","2920":"39   See  also  the German draft bill  to amend GWB,  which provides  that \u201c[i]n  determining the paramount \nsignificance of an undertaking for competition across markets, particular account shall be taken of: 1. \nits dominant position on one or more markets, 2. its financial strength or its access to other resources, 3. \nits vertical integration and its activities on otherwise related markets, 4. its access to data relevant for \ncompetition, 5. the importance of its activities for third parties' access to supply and sales markets and \nits related influence on third parties' business activities.\u201d ","2921":"In this Part, we propose the principles that should apply to Systemic Digital Platforms \nin  order  to  ensure  the  fairness  and  contestability  of  EU  digital  markets.  Instead  of \nlaying down highly detailed and prescriptive rules, the ex ante regulation should set \nout core principles, which are fleshed out in an accompanying guidance paper and \nfurther developed through the enforcement process.41  ","2922":"The  principles  would  limit  or  prohibit  Systemic  Digital  Platforms  from  engaging  in \nconduct considered to be particularly harmful, such as self-preferencing or reducing \ninteroperability with competing products or services. Of course, such practices may \nwell be prohibited under Article 102 TFEU. However, given the potential for harm when \nsuch  Systemic  Digital  Platforms  engage  in  such  conduct, ex ante  regulation  would \nintroduce  a  reversal  in  the  burden  of  proof,  whereby  such  practices  would  be \npresumed unlawful.42 It would then be for the Systemic Digital Platform to prove that \nits  conduct  does  not  have  adverse  effects  on  competition.  The  Systemic  Digital \nPlatform should also have the right to provide an objective justification for its conduct \nor point to demonstrable efficiencies that are passed on to consumers that outweigh \nanti-competitive  effects.  That  would  ensure  that  ex  ante  regulation  does  not \ndiscourage pro-competitive practices. We now turn to particular practices that could \nbe addressed with the ex ante rules. ","2923":"A particular type of vertical leveraging that should be regulated is self-preferencing \nby Systemic Digital Platforms, namely using market power in one market to favor their \nposition in an adjacent or related market at the expense of their rivals, e.g., by giving \npreferential  treatment  to  their  own  products  and  services.43  There  is  growing ","2924":"43   According to the context, self-preference tactics may come in different shapes and forms, e.g., a systemic \nplatform operating a search engine or an online marketplace may modify its ranking algorithm to give an \nadvantage to its own products or services (e.g., in the form of a more prominent position in the results or \na visually richer and more attractive format). ","2925":"As observed above, one clear example of harmful self-preferencing is when Google \nplaces  its  \u201cHotel  search\u201d  or  \u201cFlights  search\u201d  units  above  all  higher  ranked  organic \nsearch  results,  hence  discounting  organic  search  results  in  favor  of  its  own  travel \nproducts.  Users  will  be  drawn  to  these  Google  travel  products  not  because  they \nprovide superior services, but because they are guaranteed a privileged position by \nGoogle  on  top  of  the  SERP.  These  products  are  prominently  featured  on  the  SERP \nbecause  Google  determine  where  its  page  placement  algorithm  displays  its  own \nvertical product relative to the organic results produced by its search engine, which it \ncan  do  because  of  the  lack  of  competition.  In  this  case,  self-preferencing  hurts \ncompetition, innovation and consumer choice.  ","2926":"This self-preferencing problem is further aggravated when organic search results are \nalso discounted by advertising as organic search almost entirely disappears from the \nscreen. This forces travel tech operators to buy expensive advertising, which \u2013 while \nbeing  extremely  profitable  to  Google  \u2013  increases  their  cost  of  customer  acquisition \nand distribution, and squeezes their margins. ","2927":"In addition to pushing organic search results from the screen, Google is able to funnel \ntraffic  to  its  own  vertical  search  product  through  a  \u201cbait and switch\u201d  mechanism, \nWhen a user clicks on a listing in the Hotel search unit display, the user thinks that he \nwill be taken to the listing he clicks on, but in fact, regardless of the listing on which he \nclicks, he is taken to the Hotel Finder page, not to the listing he selected \u2013The user then \nseparately inputs her search details into Google\u2019s Hotel Finder on this separate page \n(e.g., dates, star rating, budget, services such as Wi-Fi) for a new search. \nAs long as Google is allowed to give preferential treatment to its own products on the \nSERP, as well as to load the top of the SERP with ads discounting organic traffic, market \nplayers such as the members of EU travel tech will have to spend more while getting \nless  traffic  and  conversion  on  its  ad  spend.  This  hurts  growth,  innovation  and \nconsumer choice.  ","2928":"As explained above, the ability to internally combine and  use data across products \nand  services  may  enable  a  platform  like  Google  to  engage  in  \u201cenvelopment\u201d \nstrategies aimed at conquering new markets through cross-subsidization. This is, for \ninstance, illustrated by the Google Flights service, which Google does not monetize by \ncharging a fee, but by collecting data that it will monetize through search or display \nads.  An  appropriate  response  would  be  to  place  strict  limitations  on  the  Systemic ","2929":"In  the  alternative,  and  in  order  to  preserve  efficiencies  stemming  from  data  cross-\nusage, the Systemic Digital Platforms could be prohibited from using data collected \nfrom one product or service in order to improve advertising for another product.45 That \nwould be especially the case where the data is provided by business users for the sole \npurpose of servicing the business user\u2019s advertising, but where the business user has \nno option to limit the ability of the Systemic Digital Platforms to use this data for other \npurposes.  ","2930":"Multi-homing has the potential to enable new entrants to build a sufficiently large user \nbase  and  eventually  challenge  the  Systemic  Digital  Platform,  introducing  much-\nneeded  competition  \u201cfor\u201d  the  market.  As  a  result,  measures  impeding  multi-homing \nentrench  the  Systemic  Digital  Platform\u2019s  position  by  \u201clocking  in\u201d  users  and  erecting \nbarriers  to  entry.  For  this  reason,  it  is  important  that  Systemic  Digital  Platforms  be \nprohibited  from  taking  measures  that  impede  multi-homing,  such  as  reducing  user \ndata portability.46  ","2931":"46   Of the same view the authors of the Cr\u00e9mer Report, page 57 (\u201cit is important to ensure that multi-homing \nis possible and that dominant platforms do not impede its practice\u201d) and page 58 (\u201cwe feel that a measure \nby which a dominant firm impedes multi-homing is suspect and an efficiency defence would be needed\u201d). \nSee also German draft bill to amend GWB, according to which undertakings with paramount significance \nfor  competition  across  markets  should  be  prohibited  from  making  the  interoperability  of  products  or \nservices or data portability more difficult and thereby impending competition.

To this end,  the Commission  should \nadopt a threshold for interim measures that is lower than the one currently contained \nat  Article  8(1)  of    Regulation  1\/2003,  which  requires  a  \u201cprima facie\u201d  finding  of \ninfringement and an urgent need for interim measures to avert the risk of \u201cserious and \nirreparable\u201d damage to competition.

","2947":"Eu travel tech fully shares the assessment made by the European Commission of the need \nto  bring  changes  to  the  current  competition  rules  to  allow  for  enforcement  action \npreserving the competitiveness of markets. Indeed, these last years have been the stage \nof a  broad policy  debate on this  matter,  stirred  by  the  emergence of a subset of large \nconsumer-facing  digital  platforms  active  in  several  markets  whose  systemic  role \nthreatens the fairness and openness of EU markets.  ","2948":"In the attached paper, eu travel tech sets out its views on how to complement the existing \nEU competition law toolbox in order to guarantee fair and undistorted competition and a \nlevel  playing  field  in  the  internal  market.  Digital  platforms,  including  eu  travel  tech \nmembers1,  provide  consumers  with  significant  benefits  and  account  for  around  60%  of \nprivate consumption of digital goods and services2. Yet, the growth of  a subset of large \ndigital platforms and their increasing tendency to move into new and unrelated markets, \nas well as to show preference to their own products and services to exclude rivals, has \ndemonstrated the increased importance to have specific regulation that prevents abuse. \nIntervention based on competition law alone may not be sufficient to address and deter \nsuch conducts.  ","2949":"Rather, we believe that existing ex post enforcement should be complemented by an ex \nante  framework,  which  could  address  certain  limitations  of  antitrust  enforcement, \nensuring  EU  markets  remain  fair  and  contestable  to  the  benefit  of  consumers.  In  this \nregard, we support the general objective of this initiative: ensuring fair and undistorted \ncompetition  in  the  internal  market  by  complementing  traditional  antitrust  enforcement \nwith a new tool.

","2951":"The  current  tools  are  effective  against  collusions,  other  restrictive  conducts,  as  well  as  abuses  by \ndominant firms. Particularly, art. 102 TFEU clearly identifies the prohibited conducts against freedom of \ncompetition  in  case  of  dominant  position.  The  choice  to  limit  the  prohibition  of  these  conducts  to \ndominant undertakings lies in our view in the need to allow all undertakings, including the smallest one, \nto  grow  and  actually  compete  on  the  market,  also  against  the  biggest  ones,  such  us  dominant \nundertakings. To that purpose (i.e. ensuring free and effective competition) only dominant undertakings \nbear the limitations of article 102 TFEU. Therefore, we believe that the possibility for the Commission to \ntake actions for preventing non-dominant undertakings from growing should be avoided, provided that in \ncase such growth leads to a dominant position, art. 102 TFEU shall apply.  ","2952":"In  our  view  the  fact  that  the  NCT  would  broaden  the  Commission\u2019s  scope  for  intervention  in  business \nactivities of non-dominant players \u2013 that, up to now, is regarded as entirely legitimate and lawful \u2013 would \nclash with the well-established legal EU framework and case-law according to which holding or acquiring \na dominant position is not per se unlawful under EU competition law, i.e. it is not an offence in itself for a \nfirm to have a dominant position. What is offensive is to abuse of the position of dominance (see para 1 \nof the Communication from the Commission \u2014 Guidance on the Commission's enforcement priorities in \napplying  Article  82  of  the  EC  Treaty  to  abusive  exclusionary  conduct  by  dominant  undertakings).  As  is \nwell known, the legal expression \u201cdominant position\u201d is a binary term: either an undertaking is dominant \nand therefore subject to art. 102 and the \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d not to hinder competition on the market \nthat it entails; or it is not, in which case its unilateral behavior is not subject to competition law scrutiny \nat all.  By  imposing  possible  far  reaching  behavioral and\/or  structural remedies  on  non-dominant  firms, \nthe  Commission  would  attribute  to  every  market-player  that  \u201cspecial  responsibility\u201d  which  has  been \nroutinely repeated in the judgements of the EU Courts and the decisions of the Commission on art. 102 \nand  always  attributed  to  dominant  players  only.  The  NCT  could  therefore  become  a  notable  departure \nfrom decades of competition law enforcement. ","2953":"Furthermore, if EU competition rules are applied too aggressively, by making them over-inclusive (as the \nNCT  seems  to  propose),  firms  might  refrain  from  conducts  which  are  pro-competitive.  In  this  respect, \naction against any alleged detrimental effects on the market due to a lack of competition would have to \ntake account of any risks related to over-enforcement and a higher likelihood of false positives. ","2954":"Finally, acting against unilateral conducts of non-dominant firm would affect the ultimate function of the \npublic enforcement of competition law, namely safeguarding the process of competition as a means of \nenhancing  consumer  welfare  (see  SPEECH\/05\/537  23.09.2005  of  former  Commission  Neelie  Kroes), \nwhich would turn into protecting competitors, including inefficient ones.    ","2955":"Needless  to  say,  as  for  the  agreements  between  competitors  (horizontal)  or  between  non  competing \nundertakings (vertical), art. 101 TFUE and the Commission\u2019s communications and case law clarify already \nthat those may be triggered not only by an actual contract or an informal arrangement between those \nundertakings. Even an exchange of commercially sensitive information, or a unilateral disclosure of such \ninformation may fall within the restrictions (and sanctions) set forth by art. 101 of the Treaty (and the \nsubsequent  sanctions).  Therefore,  it  would  be  hard  to  understand  in  which  extent  such  tools  already \nprohibiting any kind of collusion between undertakings may be further enlarged. ","2956":"be a legal basis for introducing new conducts, i.e. to punish behaviours falling outside arts. 101 and 102 \nTFEU: in fact, the NCT would go beyond arts. 101 and 102. As a result, if the proposed competition new \ntools have to be given to the Commission, arguably this will need an amendment to the Treaty.  ","2957":"Since, as said above, the proposed new rules, introducing the NCT, may leave room for uncertainty and \nunpredictability  of  the  application  of  competition  law,  this  could  expose  DG  Comp  to  a  lot  of  pressure \nfrom  public  and  private  powers.  In  fact,  (i)  it  would  be  hard  to  understand,  ex  ante,  which  conduct  is \nantitrust compliant and which is not, and (ii) in any case of alleged market failure, DG Comp would be \ncalled to \u201center the arena\u201d and fix it. \nCompetition  law  if  not  a  tool  for  the  optimization\/fine-tuning  of  market  outcomes:  the  proposed  NCT \ncould change this, having an impact on the nature itself of competition law. One could want this or not, \nyet it is necessary to understand that the introduction of such a tool could have this effect. ","2958":"In  our  view,  in  certain  markets  it  is  quite  hard  to  figure  undertakings  causing  themselves  \u201cstructural \ncompetition problems\u201d, which are not holding a dominant position on the market. Should such situation \nhappen, i.e. non-dominant undertakings affect directly the market causing, or relying on, such \u201cstructural \ncompetition problems\u201d, we observe the following: ","2959":"in  the  lack of  a  dominant position, the  commercial conducts  of  undertakings  willing  to  extend \ntheir market position to related markets, increase their  market power or market share, develop \nnew  or  innovative  products  (also  relying  on  new  technologies),  rely  on  economies  of  scale,  or \noffering lower prices etc. which naturally harm competitors, should not be considered unlawful, \nas the will of market operators to grow and strengthen their business cannot be considered anti-\ncompetitive, unless this leads to the abuse of a dominant position pursuant to art. 102 TFEU; ","2960":"the opportunity envisaged by the Commission to impose behavioural or structural measures on \nundertakings in the lack of an abuse of dominant position pursuant to art. 102 TFEU appears to \nbe  an  excessive  remedy.  On  the  one  hand,  such  measures  could  affect  the  undertakings \nconcerned  beyond  the  intentions  of  the  Commission,  with  the  potential  exclusion  of  efficient \nmarket  players  from  the  market;  on  the  other  hand  such  measures  may  advantage  other \nundertakings, which could then be subject to the same measures, thus leading to extra-regulated \nmarket, to detriment of the principle of freedom of competition on the merits. ","2961":"In addition, we remark that the enforcement of EU competition law by the Commission goes in parallel \nwith the enforcement made by national authorities and local applicable laws to protect fair competition \non the market. In this respect, we deem worthy to mention that in Italy the rules on \u201cabuse of economic \ndependence\u201d pursuant to art. 9 of the law n. 192\/1998, already address those concerns raised by the NCT \non abusive conducts put in place by non-dominant undertakings. In particular, this provision prohibits the \nabuse by one or more companies of the state of economic dependence, defined as \"situation in which an \nundertaking  is  able  to  cause,  in  its  commercial  relations  with  another  undertaking,  an  excessive \nimbalance of rights and obligations. Economic dependence shall also be assessed taking into account the \nreal possibility for the party subject to abuse, to find satisfactory alternatives on the market. Abuse may \nalso  consist  in  a  refusal  to  sell  or  a  refusal  to  buy,  the  imposition  of  unjustifiably  onerous  or \ndiscriminatory contractual conditions, or the arbitrary interruption of existing commercial relations\". The \nrules on abuse of economic dependence award to the Italian Competition Authority the power to activate \nits  investigation  powers  and  impose  sanctions.  According  to  the  national  case-law,  the  \u201cabuse  of \neconomic  dependence\u201d  has  general  application,  suitable  for  including  any  asymmetrical  negotiation \nrelationship between companies, without the need to assess the existence of a dominant position. ","2962":"Moreover,  as  said  already,  as  for  the  agreements  between  competitors  (horizontal)  or  between  non \ncompeting  undertakings  (vertical), art.  101  TFUE  and  the  communications  and  case  law  clarify  already \nthat those may be triggered not only by an actual contract or an informal arrangement between those \nundertakings. Even an exchange of commercially sensitive information, or a unilateral disclosure of such \ninformation may fall within the restrictions (and sanctions) set forth by art. 101 of the Treaty. Therefore, \nit  would  be  hard  to  understand  in  which  extent  such  tools  already  prohibiting  any  kind  of  collusion \nbetween undertakings may be further enlarged ","2963":"If there is a problem with antitrust tools being insufficient to address problematic digital \nplatform markets, then the first approach must be to fix antitrust, rather than create a \nnew  layer  of  market  supervision.    DG  COMP  has  not  clearly  identified  the  gaps  in \ncompetition law, nor why antitrust economic tools cannot be adapted to solve these \nissues.  We make some proposals in this regard; Telefonica believes that antitrust can \nbe adapted to capture problematic digital platform markets. ","2964":"\u2022  The evidence contained in the IIA does not support DG COMP\u2019s assertion that there are \nmore  general  market  concentration  problems  in  the  economy.    The  referenced \neconomic papers, in particular from the OECD, contradict the narrative put forward in \nthe IIA.  The Commission has not done enough to justify a horizontal tool that covers \nthe whole economy, there simply isn\u2019t the economic evidence of a problem. ","2965":"\u2022  Telefonica believes that there are competition problems in digital platform markets, but \nwe believe that an ex-ante framework is the better approach to deal with these digital \nplatform  markets  \u2013  as  happens  in  other  sectors  which  require  systematic  targeted \nintervention.    So  we  are  strongly  supporting  DG  CNECT\u2019s  parallel  proposal  3b  as  an \nalternative to any NCT. ","2966":"\u2022  The legal basis given in the IIA to justify the need of the NCT are  misconceived: the \nNCT takes the form of an \u201cex-ante\u201d intervention, yet explicitly the need for an NCT is \nbased  there  being  no  breach  of  antitrust  rules  under  the meaning of  Art.  101 &  102 \nTFUE.  It follows that the NCT cannot be justified based on Art. 103 TFUE.  ","2967":"\u2022  The UK\u2019s market investigation tool is seen as a model for the NCT, at least by DG COMP.  \nThe  CMA\u2019s  MI  tool  has  a  number  of  important  checks  and  balances,  in  particular  in \nrelation to the selection of markets for review and the separation of the investigation \nfunction  from  the  CMA  executive.    Telefonica  believes  that  a  limited  NCT  might \ngenerate wider support if the Commission is clearer on how the application of any \nnew rules would be triggered and controlled. ","2968":"\u2022  Similarly, clarity of scope will be important if the Commission is to develop its case for \nan  NCT.    Any  NCT  proposed  by  the  Commission  will  only  deal  with  Single  Market \nproblems, rather than national markets.  Telefonica believes that any NCT should not \nadd regulation to already economically regulated sectors, especially in light of the lack \nof evidence presented for a general weakening of competition.  Existing laws are more \nthan enough for those already regulated ex-ante. ","2969":"To answer these questions a thorough and rigorous economic analysis of the impact on social \nwelfare would be required, something that is lacking at the moment. Absent this analysis, the \nCommission should opt for the least intrusive of the proposed measures. And if, as it seems, the \nwelfare problem is confined to a certain set of businesses of well-known features, then the tool \nshould be limited also to that scope. ","2970":"Use the existing Article 17 sector-inquiry power to improve the regulatory framework \nor feed into regulatory initiatives: a further use of sector inquiries would help to solve \n(if any) likely structural market failures in traditional sectors, having DG COMP making \nsuggestions to regulators with the \u201cex-ante remedies\u201d power left to the discretion of \nthe sector specific regulator; ","2971":" \n \n \n \n \n\fIn  addition,  the  current  reviews  on  the  Horizontal  and  Vertical  Guidelines  and  the  Market \nDefinition Notice should be clearly focused on the Digital Economy, in order to respond to the \nchallenges and new types of agreements emerging from the digital sector; as well as to address \nhow the presence of digital platforms should be taken into account defining a relevant product \nmarket.  ","2972":"If there are problems with antitrust methodologies that make it difficult to deal with competition \nproblems in digital markets, then DG COMP should seek to improve and update the defective \nmethods  \u2013  rather than propose  an incremental layer of  market  regulation.    If your car stops \nworking at the side of the road, you don\u2019t immediately buy a new one.  You see if you can fix up \nyour car and go on your way.  Telefonica has long argued that antitrust rules require updating \u2013 \nthey do not need to be superseded by a New Competition Tool. ","2973":"Finally, an ex-ante framework is better suited to deal with sector specific market failures than a \nNew Competition Tool.  In our response to DG CNECT\u2019s parallel consultation, we show how its \nOption 3b \u2013 a full ex-ante regulatory framework, could be made tractable.  There is no need to \nduplicate supervision through a sector specific NCT as well. This is especially true given the lack \nof academic consensus and the principle of proportionality when establishing new rules. ","2974":"Indeed, we note that DG COMP wants to ensure that overlap with the proposals of DG CNECT is \nminimised, similarly it should also be seeking to remove any conflicts with general competition \nlaw and sector specific regulation for other industries.  This is best undertaken in the round, \nduring the review of competition law, rather than as an adjunct to the proposals of DG CNECT.   ","2975":"\u2022  The  problems  in  digital  markets  will  affect  all  markets,  because  all  markets  will \neventually become digital.  This claim is obviously not true, or at least presents a gross \nsimplification  of  how  the  interfaces  between  digital  platforms  and  the  rest  of  the \neconomy work.  Just because Uber uses a digital platform to compete with taxi firms, \ndoes  not  make  the  entire  taxi  or  personal  transportation  sector  \u201cdigital\u201d.    It  is  the \nintermediation service of the platform of Uber that is \u201cdigital\u201d, not the act of paying a \ntaxi fare in exchange for transportation.

It is important to examine the profits of all firms, rather than \na subset; and\/or ","2977":"(2)  The next question to ask is whether \u201csupernormal\u201d profits are a transitory feature or \nnot?    In  contestable  markets  with  freedom  of  entry  and  exit,  it  is  the  presence  of \nsupernormal profits that encourages entry and innovation by rivals, which eats into the \nprofit taking by the established firms, returning profitability back to the efficient level.  \nThe transitory existence of higher profits is an economic signal for more competition to \ntake place, not a signal for regulation. ","2978":"It is only where markets are not contestable, there is limited or no entry and exit,  and where \nsupernormal profits persist for a protracted period that, from an economic point of view, there \nmight be a competition problem.  Digital markets are often said to exhibit such features, but it \nis the contestability that should be tackled in our view, not the profit margins which are just a \nsymptom.  This is why Telefonica supports an ex-ante regime based on securing contestability, \nlike Option 3b proposed by DG CNECT. ","2979":"Returning to the justification for a horizontal new competition tool, the Commission quotes its \nown  Single  Market  Performance  Report  20192  as  showing  that  there  is  \u201ca  growing  body  of \neconomic evidence in the EU  suggesting increasing  market  concentration  and increasing firm \nprofitability levels\u201d [our emphasis].  Firstly, Telefonica notes that the relevant passage from the \nreport runs to just one page out of sixty-two.  On page 25 of the Staff Working Document, the \nCommission\u2019s analysis of \u201csigns of weakening competition\u201d is as follows: ","2980":"\u201cFollowing a period of relative stability, indicators of competition have deteriorated after \nthe [2008 financial] crisis. These trends are less pronounced in Europe than in US but still \nclearly detectable [\u2026..] The observed patterns include industry-level concentration which \naccording  to  OECD  data  climbed  over  the  past  20  years  in  both  the  US  and  Europe. \nPossible explanations include structural changes in the economy, in particular the rise of \nnew  technologies  with more efficient  production methods,  as  well as  a weakening of \ncompetition.\u201d [our emphasis] ","2981":"\u201cIndustry  concentration  is  related  to,  but  distinct  from,  the  concept  of  market \nconcentration. Industry concentration measures the extent to which economic activity is \nconcentrated within a small number of large companies or business groups within an \nindustry.  Market  concentration,  instead,  describes  the  weight  of  leading  firms  in  a \nmarket for particular products or services that are close substitutes. Accordingly, market \nconcentration  is  a  far  narrower  definition  than  what  is  typically  reflected  in  industry \nconcentration  measures.  The  fact  that  a  large  share  of  industry  activity  is  due  to  a ","2982":" \n \n \n \n\fhandful  of  large  firms  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  product  markets  within  that \nindustry are highly concentrated.

It has failed to demonstrate a relationship between industry concentration and \nmarket concentration, as well as failing to demonstrate that market concentration (which it has \nnot measured) leads to the creation of market power.  Finally, as Bajgar highlights, concentration \nmight just be a \u201csign of competition in action\u201d, rather than a priori a competition problem.  ","2985":"The  referenced  Staff  Working  Document  posits  that  efficiency,  new  technology,  structural \nchange  and\/or  a  weakening  of  competition  could  all  be  \u201cpossible  explanations\u201d  for  higher \nindustry (sic) concentration.  Being just one of many \u201cpossible explanations\u201d is not a sufficiently \nrobust basis on which to make proposals to regulate competition in the entire economy through \na  New  Competition Tool.  Furthermore,  this  evidence  relates only  to  industry concentration, \nrather than demonstrating cause and effect \u2013 that increased industry concentration has led to \nnegative  consequences  for  consumers  in  terms  of  price,  quality  and  choice.    It  is  a  factual \nobservation about industry concentration made in the paper, not a determinative point about \npersistent supernormal profits of firms in more concentrated product markets.

","2986":"\u201cThe  trend  involving  higher  concentration  ratios  and  markups  is  also  reflected  in \nincreased market  power, especially among larger firms.  Possible explanations  include \nchanges  in  business  dynamics  and  structure  of  markets.  This  concerns  winner-takes-\nmost  outcomes,  also  referred  to  as  the  \u201csuperstar  firm\u201d  hypothesis,  where  the  more \nproductive firms increasingly reap the benefits of network effects and scale economies.\u201d \n[our emphasis] ","2987":"\u201cThe digitalisation of the economy increases the importance of knowledge assets.

Regulation, \nwhile  instrumental  in  certain  professional  services,  can  often  be  associated  with  significant \neconomic costs through limiting market entry and competition.\u201d  In some services at least, the \nsolution is deregulation, not more regulation.

It should be ensured that DG COMP allows for this \ncontinuous feedback during the procedure until the final result when the Market Study \nturns to \u201cPhase 2\u201d with the Market Reference where there is a higher likelihood that \nremedies might be imposed. ","2999":"We also see that there is a potential overlap with competition law, in particular  with merger \nprocedures.  One feature of merger analysis is to understand whether theories of harm related \nto the merger could be tackled by the specific sector regulatory regime.  It follows that DG COMP \nwill need to determine whether, in any given merger scenario, the NCT would be able to deal \nwith the competition problem it foresees.  This is just one example, but it shows that given the \nnature of the tool, the NCT should really be considered in relation to competition law overall, \nrather than just the overlap with a potential sector specific ex-ante tool proposed by DG CNECT.  ","3000":"The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to \nthe European Commission on the New Competition Tool. While doing that, we will make  reference to \nrelevant aspects presented in the separate Inception Impact Assessment on the New Competition Tool \nthat  the  European  Commission  published  when  launching  the  DSA  consultation.  ITI  is  also  submitting \ncomments separately to the parallel questionnaire on the broader DSA issues and the gatekeeper aspects.  ","3001":"As the global voice of the tech industry, ITI strongly supports free and undistorted competition as key to \npromoting innovation and consumer welfare. Together with our member companies, that include leading \ninnovation players with worldwide value chains and active through all the segments of the technology \nsector, we are committed to addressing challenges potentially arising from digitalisation globally and in \nthe EU.  ","3002":"ITI is resolutely in favour of this reflection process as part of a broader policy debate about the need for \nchanges  to  the  current  competition  law  framework  in  order  to  allow  interventions  that  preserve \ncompetitive markets. We strongly believe that proportionate instruments that ensure a consistent policy \napproach and fair competition should be considered wherever necessary.  ","3003":"With  this  goal  in  mind,  grasping  differences  in  business  models  and  user  interaction  across  digital \nplatforms is key to gauging potential non-competitive conduct and properly addressing any challenges. As \nthe notion of platform refers to very different business models, policymakers should consider the role \nthat specific companies play in the markets they operate in, the value they create, their relationship to \ncustomers and competitors, and the possible alternatives. The goal should be to ensure market access for \ninnovative challengers, ensure consumer welfare and economic efficiency, and focus on resolving proven \nmarket failures.  ","3004":"ITI  believes  that  any  remedies  would  have  to  focus  on  the  specific  situation,  and  be  preceded  by  a \nconsideration  of  whether  other,  less  radical  alternative  approaches  would  be  effective.  It  would  be \ndifficult to enact a one-size-fits-all approach across all types of situations. Policymakers should consider \nhow to ensure that new market entrants are able to succeed, while not imposing rigid rules that disrupt \nthe consumer experience or value that they receive from a platform. ","3005":"With regard to Question no. 6, the Commission links the need for a New Competition Tool (\u201cNCT\u201d) to the \nexistence of structural competition problems that cannot be tackled under the EU competition rules while \nresulting in inefficient market outcomes. We recommend that the Commission provides more evidence \nin  support  of  this  statement,  also  considering  that  while  competition  challenges  may  exist,  further \nconsideration should be given to the fact that by reducing entry barriers and making it easier for small \nsuppliers to reach new customers, innovative technologies and businesses benefit consumers by offering \nnew services and increasing competition and economic efficiencies in innumerable fields. By doing so, \nthey offer major opportunities to start-ups and SMEs, who can grow more and faster than they would \notherwise do, underpinning future European prosperity.  ","3006":"We would welcome a deeper reflection by the Commission on the problem definition and market analysis \nto support the introduction of new measures (such as those described in the IIA). Among other aspects, \ndeeper  analysis  of  network  effects  is  needed  \u2013  markets  are  not  necessarily  less  competitive  or  less \ninnovative, as there are several medium and smaller platforms that continue to help customers reach a \nwide range of goods and services. This is particularly relevant as regards the statement in the IIA on the \nNCT that intervention at national level would not be effective, as it is not infrequent that the competitive \nbalance varies significantly in some Member States\u2019 markets where local platforms play a very strong role.  ","3007":"Competitive dynamics across platforms offering different core services to the same customers should also \nbe assessed. Grasping differences in business models and user interaction across digital platforms is key \nto  gauging  potential  non-competitive  conduct  and  properly  addressing  any  challenges.  Enforcement \nshould focus on a company\u2019s conduct and not on structural issues, like the amount of data a company \nholds, or its size. Nevertheless, all of the options under consideration in the IIA would allow the European \nCommission  to  impose  behavioural  or  structural  remedies  even  in  absence  of  any  infringement.  In \naddition, the IIA does not provide any indication as to what kind of behavioural or structural remedies \nwould be deemed appropriate for application to a business that has not been infringing any rules.   ","3008":"As a  minimum, if a new tool were to be introduced, it should be subject to the highest threshold of burden \nof proof,  demonstrating that any remedy is underpinned by robust economic analysis. Competition policy \nenforcement  should  focus  in  particular  on  consumer  welfare,  not  on  protecting  competitors.  For \nexample, artificially constraining the size of a company or network may appear to increase competition, \nbut it could also reduce consumer welfare. Policymakers should consider how to ensure that new market \nentrants are able to succeed, ensuring markets remain open to innovative challengers, while not imposing \nrigid rules that disrupt the consumer experience or value that they receive from a business, therefore \nkeeping consumer welfare and economic efficiency as final objectives.  ","3009":"In addition, platforms play a beneficial role as engines of the digital marketplace, not least by facilitating \ninformation and communication and helping match offer and demand in the Digital Single Market and \nglobally. Platforms make it easier for consumers to buy online, compare products and their prices, learn \nfrom other consumers\u2019 experiences. In e-commerce, they are one of the main channels for cross-border \ntransactions, allowing SMEs to compete beyond their national market and grow more, or more rapidly, \nthan they would without an online intermediary. Consumers greatly benefit from the resulting increase \nin competition, variety and offer. ","3010":"Most  discussion  of  antitrust  issues  and  platforms  seems  to  focus  on  large  companies.  While \nefficiencies  of  scale  and  network  effects  may  push  toward  concentration,  this  is  not  always  the \nnecessary  outcome  and  careful  analysis  of  the  network  effects  as  applied  to  different  markets  is \nneeded \u2013 they will not necessarily be less competitive or less innovative. Furthermore, a concentrated \nmarket  does  not  in  itself  present  a  structural  competition  problem  as  long  as  competition  among  the \nexisting players results in competitive prices, quality, choice, and innovative products and services. Market \ndefinitions  should  better  reflect  the  competitive  dynamics  in  the  sectors  (for  example  competition \nbetween  online  and  offline  operators  in  a  certain  market).  Also,  these  markets  are  increasingly \ncompetitive and innovative, as medium and smaller Internet platforms continue to play important roles \nin helping match suppliers and customers for a wide range of goods and services. In addition, the presence \nof large platforms can increase competition by making it easier for users to reach a vast range of suppliers \nand find the best offers. ","3011":"First, a high degree of vertical integration in itself does not represent a structural competition problem \nand might in some instances increase competition. The benefits of vertical integration are recognized in \nthe Commission\u2019s Guidelines on Non-Horizontal Mergers: the elimination of double-marginalization and \nbetter alignment of incentives as regards the development, production and marketing of new products \nand services. They can also be consumer welfare enhancing, by improving user experience and increase \nuser safety.  ","3012":"It is important to consider how gatekeeper definitions may apply to companies with multiple verticals. For \nexample, a company may have a  dominant position in  one area, such as  social media, ecommerce, or \nmusic streaming, but also compete as a smaller player with large platforms that dominate other verticals. \nThe Commission should focus on specific conduct and actions, rather than the size of one or more business \nunits. Furthermore, the variegated nature of online platforms and the incentives driving specific decisions \nby platforms must be taken into account when assessing conduct. An incentive to protect the user against \nfraud, data violations or security threats might be to the immediate detriment of specific business users, \nwhile sustaining consumer trust to the benefit of all users. ","3013":"Consideration of issues related to switching, access to data and portability  (also addressed in Q. 18.9) \nwould  necessarily  have  to  focus  on  the  specific  platform  and  data  concerned,  and  the  available \nalternatives. It would be difficult to enact a one-size-fits-all approach to these issues across all types of \nplatforms. Relatedly, bundling between operating systems and applications could on the one hand limit \nchoice, while on the other benefit consumers, for instance by offering mobile devices working right out \nof the box.  ","3014":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fOne the one hand, proposals to artificially constrain the size of networks might increase competition while \nreducing consumer welfare. Moreover, users may even benefit from concentration, as it enables them to \nrely  on  one  (or  few)  platform(s)  for  each  specific  service  or  activity,  be  it  shopping,  social  interaction, \ntransportation or accommodation among others. This should not necessarily lead to competition concerns \n\u2013 when a new, more innovative and competitive alternative will come along, it will supplant the current \nincumbent  platforms  as  users  will  migrate  towards  it  for  either  one  or  all  aspects  of  a  given  service. \nFurthermore, network effects can go both ways \u2013 they can reinforce a company\u2019s market position but also \nweaken it \u2013 if users no longer trust the platform on one side, the other side will also look elsewhere. ","3015":"On the other hand, network  effects may however disincentivise switching between platforms, thereby \npossibly diminishing choice and effective competition (see also Q. 18.9). This could be reinforced in some \ncases  by  lack  of  interoperability.  In  this  context,  better  understanding  how  certain  company  practices \nimpact a specific market and correcting potential imbalances and failures may be useful, as long as such \ntools and rules are carefully assessed in order not to negatively impact consumer choice, innovation, and \nrapidly evolving markets and business models.  ","3016":"This issue is also referred to in Q. 6. Big data generates substantial innovations and efficiency gains, many \nof which are passed on to consumers, who are offered new products and services often free of charge. In \naddition, controlling large datasets does not necessarily lead to market power, as most digital markets are \ncharacterised by vigorous dynamic competition. As with many other assets, data could potentially be used \nin anticompetitive ways: large network effects can potentially diminish consumer choice and effective \ncompetition. This could be reinforced by lack of interoperability and the possibility to exert filtering power, \nwhich grows with size. ITI believes that competition policy can currently deal with these situations, and \nthe existing European legal framework gives competition and data protection regulators abundant tools \nto  protect  markets  and  consumers  when  needed.  At  the  same  time,  intervention  should  focus  on  a \ncompany\u2019s conduct and not on structural issues as such, like the size of a company or the amount of data \nit  holds  or  collects.  In  most  cases  the  acquisition  and  use  of  data  does  not  represent  a  threat  to \ncompetition \u2013 and large amounts of data, including personal information, are increasingly a vital input for \nsome of the economy\u2019s most important innovations, in healthcare, safety, transport and environmental \nprotection just to name a few. In this context, independent data analysis solutions play an important role \nin helping provide transparency to the market.  ","3017":"As regards the issue of extension in related markets (referred to in Qs. 7A, 8) platforms can also extend \ninto other markets with their own applications that compete with other providers, sometimes leveraging \ntheir pre-existing position from one market to another. While this should be closely monitored, it could \nhave pro-competitive effects: by reducing entry barriers and making it easier for small suppliers to reach \nnew  customers,  platforms  increase  competitive  pressure  on  traditional  industries  like  transport, \ncommunications,  or  tourism,  to  the  benefit  of  consumers.  Regulators  should  in  these  cases  focus  on \nconsumer welfare, not on protecting competitors. Platforms that provide more choice and lower prices \nusually lead to some disruption on more traditional competitors in the market. Any potential intervention ","3018":"The survey also asks whether large amount of data have an anti-competitive role when a company with \nmarket power in a core market may apply repeated strategies to extend its market position to related \nmarkets (question 8). We believe that value of data depends on its commercial use and generally does \nnot  raise  special  antitrust-related  concerns,  as  in  itself  it  neither constitutes  a  barrier  to  entry,  nor  by \ndefault grants a competitive advantage in the market. In fact, holding a certain amount of data can often \nlead to a competitive advantage if a business is also able to analyse and extract value from it, which is \noften passed on to consumers through new applications. Moreover, the amount of data is infinite, and \ndata is non-rivalrous in that it can be simultaneously collected and use by multiple firms, and consumers \ncan  use  or  share  their  data  multiple  times.  When  acting  as  an  antitrust  enforcer,  we  recommend  the \nCommission  therefore  assess  data  under  the  existing  competition  framework  as  any  other  asset  that \ncompanies compete with in the market.  ","3019":"Question 14 refers to pricing algorithms, as automated tools that allow very frequent changes to prices \nand other terms taking into account all or most competing offers on the market.  Big data and artificial \nintelligence  technologies  are  rapidly  changing  the  way  strategic  market  decisions  are  made.  An  issue \nwhich is often referred to is the potential for market distortion of pricing algorithms. The fact that pricing \nalgorithms are used or not should not change an antitrust enforcement agency\u2019s conclusion in relation to \ncertain conduct. Still, increasing use of these algorithms raises enforcement questions as it might facilitate \ncollusion, or make detection of collusive behaviour more difficult. However, concepts such as \u201cmachine-\nto-machine\u201d have not been established.  The use or misuse of pricing algorithms always requires human \ninput and thus existing tools under Article 101 are sufficient. ","3020":"The uncertainty surrounding AI technologies and the applicable rules may lead to concerns among those \nbusinesses considering the use of pricing algorithms. This would not be a desirable outcome, since there \ndo  not  seem  to  be  default  antitrust  concerns  that  would  justify  sacrificing  the  potential  economic \nefficiency brought about by AI. We therefore encourage the Commission to evaluate existing policy tools \nand use caution before taking measures that may inadvertently or unnecessarily decrease competition \ninstead of fostering it.  ","3021":"The section of the questionnaire addressing structural competition problems also addresses the issue of \ntipping markets in question 17, and the possible need to intervene \u201cearly\u201d in tipping markets to preserve \nor  \u201cimprove\u201d  competition.  In  parallel,  the  objectives  of  the  IIA  refer  to  the  importance  of  restoring \nundistorted competition. In both cases, the policy approach presented \u2013 and developed in the IIA\u2019s policy \noptions \u2013 seems to  address situations where competition has not been distorted yet, and would rather \nrequire  regulators  to  predict  the  future  development  of  a  market,  based  on  the  assumption  that \ncompetition law remedies aimed at addressing an illegal conduct that has actually taken place would not \nbe sufficient.  ","3022":"Question 18 and following address the issue of gatekeepers, which ITI is also addressing in our separate \nsubmission to the first DSA questionnaire on e-commerce issues and gatekeepers*. In our view, the nature \nof  a  platform  and  its  size  should  not  automatically  be  perceived  as  harmful,  particularly  given  the \ndemonstrated  benefits  the  platform  economy  brings  to  all  users,  including  to  deliver  trust,  reach  and \nefficiencies.    We  therefore  encourage  the  Commission  to  consider  focusing  the  scope  and  test  for \nintervention on particular actions and conduct, rather than companies. The characteristics of a market, \nspecific  activities  by  a  platform,  and  interactions  with  other  platforms  and  with  users  will  be  more \nindicative of a potential market failure than just the characteristics of a particular platform, such as market \nshare, number of users, or number of services offered.  ","3023":"In relation to question 19 on the potential need to intervene, we recognize the challenge in introducing \nnew restrictions or limitations, as the Commission does not want to create unintended consequences that \ncould needlessly hamper innovation, consumer experiences, or business growth. Carefully considering the \nimpact  of  potential  limitations  is  crucial  in  order  to  prevent  any  regulatory  failure  from  overbroad \ninstruments or poorly tailored requirements. Any potential limitation to behavior or business practices \nshould be narrowly focused to achieve the intended goal.  ","3024":"In addition, a company should not be singled out based exclusively on size (market share, number of users, \namount of services\u2026) or impact. It would be helpful to better clarify the potential consumer harm caused \nby certain platforms becoming or acting as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d and how this approach would help alleviate \ncompetitive concerns that cannot already be addressed by existing instruments. To the contrary, there is \na risk of discouraging growth beyond a certain threshold due to the increased burden of compliance with \nadditional legal obligations. ","3025":"This issue is addressed by several questions in relation to various situations (e.g. Qs 9.2, 15.2, 17.2, 19.2, \n21.2).  Also,  All  of  the  options  in  the  IIA  would  constitute  a  major  shift  from  the  current  European \nCompetition law setting based on the framework provided by articles 101 and 102 TFEU, which has served \nthe European single market well for the past nearly 60+ years, during which it has undergone deep scrutiny \nby  the  European  Courts,  demonstrating  it  is  both  durable  and  sufficiently  flexible  to  address  new \nchallenges.    ","3026":"In  the  case  of  specific  concerns  is  referred  to  in  the  survey  -  like  tacit  collusion,  or  the  growing \navailability of algorithm-based technological solutions that may facilitate the monitoring of competitors\u2019 \nconduct \u2013 we believe these could and should be addressed by more targeted measures. In any case, we \nfundamentally believe any remedy should seek to address specific unlawful conduct or a systemic problem \nin the market, not focus on the actors and the characteristics of a type of company. ","3027":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAmong  others,  the  survey  mentions  the  concept  of  \u201cearly  intervention\u201d  to  prevent  structural  risks  to \ncompetition, presumably in the future and particularly for tipping markets (for instance in question 25). \nITI believes it is difficult to conceive how this type of intervention by a public enforcement authority, in \nabsence of a well-identified infringement of existing laws, would not be too interventionist in a market \neconomy.  ","3028":"It is also our perspective that, if such a tool would ever be enacted, it should be strictly dominance-based \n(question 27). Provided that all of the options in the IIA are in our view unjustified given the potential \napplication absent any infringement, options 3 and 4 appear to be particularly problematic as they would \nallow  the  Commission  to  apply  behavioural  and  structural  remedies  even  without  a  requirement  to \ndemonstrate dominance \u2013 dominance and abuse should remain fundamental preconditions for antitrust \nintervention.  ","3029":"As regards the scope (question 28), also based on the current level of development of thinking in the IIA, \nthe  difference  between  horizontal  (options  1  and  3)  vs  limited  scope  does  not  seem  particularly \nmeaningful, since even when the scope would be limited in principle, the tool could be applied to digital \nmarkets, as well as other markets identified by the Commission. This being said, it is our perspective that \nif such a tool would ever be enacted, it should be based on rigorous application across all sectors so that \nany potential benefits apply across various markets.   ","3030":"The  need  for  remedies  should  be  evidence-based,  and  should  be  effective  and  proportionate.  Any \nremedies  should  be  objectively  justified  and  proportionate  (i.e.  requiring  the  minimum  action  that  is \nnecessary to address the problem identified). The tool  should offer the possibility to submit voluntary \ncommitments at an early stage, particularly given its non-punitive nature.  ","3031":"Finally, particularly in light of the potential to impose far-reaching behavioural remedies on non-dominant \nfirms,  any  potential  implementation  of  a  new  tool  should  contain  strong  procedural  safeguards \nguaranteeing enhanced due process and rights of defence, including a straightforward and predictable \ntest to trigger an investigation  and possible  subsequent intervention, based on clear criteria,  with the \nenforcement authority carrying the burden of proof.   ","3032":"The Commission should take into account the overall proportionality of the parallel consideration of both \nan ex ante regulatory intervention about \u201cgatekeepers\u201d and the potential introduction of broad-ranging \nex-post remedies, that are meant to address similar concerns. While in principle ITI would rather be in \nfavour  of  a  targeted  approach,  addressing  specific,  individual  situations  that  are  negatively  affecting \ncompetition, we do not believe the current options  as described in the IIA  can provide an appropriate \nbasis  for  that  approach.  We  stand  ready  to  work  with  the  Commission  to  better  scope  any  emerging \nchallenge and identify the most appropriate way forward.  ","3033":"With  our  economy  and  society  moving  to  digital  and  with  the  COVID  crisis  accelerating  this  trend,  it  is \nessential  to  ensure  that  the  online  world  remains  competitive  and  contestable.  Online  platforms  have \ncontributed  positively  to  our  society  by  offering  goods  and  services  in  a  convenient  way  that  appeals \nsignificantly to consumers while also facilitating businesses\u2019 access to global markets.  ","3034":"However, the gatekeeper role that some large online  platforms have acquired over the last +10 years has \nalso  led  to  certain  substantial  concerns,  to  the  detriment  of  the  European  Union  innovation  and \ncompetitiveness,  as  well  as  consumers\u2019  choice.  Those  issues  have  been  at  the  heart  of  the  European \nCommission  and  National  Competition  Authorities\u2019  actions  over  the  last  years  with  several  decisions \ntackling  abusive  behaviours  of global  digital  players.  Though  those  decisions  have  shown  that  the \nauthorities  can  intervene  and  sanction  certain  illegal  practices ex post,  they  have  also  demonstrated  that \ncompetition enforcement may be challenging in a fast-moving digital economy.  ","3035":"Against this background, Orange considers that competition law is overall \"fit for purpose\" and there is no \nneed to fundamentally modify it. However, to ensure fair competition within the online world, it is necessary \nto improve the current framework and develop new targeted intervention tools to efficiently tackle structural \ncompetition problems exerted by large digital platforms acting as gatekeepers. ","3036":"Structural  competition  problems  concern  practices  such  as  tying\/bundling,  leveraging  power  from  one \nmarket to another, imposing unfair business terms due to bargaining power imbalances,  imposing \"take it \nor  leave  it\"  conditions  through  retaliation  measures,  self-preferencing  and  discrimination,  priority \nplacements\/pre-installation  of  applications,  default  settings  distorting  purchasing  decisions,  imposing de \nfacto standards and abusive conditions on IP policy, creating obstacles for interoperability and for solutions \nallowing  a  sufficient  level  of  open  sources\/APIs,  imposing  proprietary  services,  restricting\/discriminating \naccess to inputs critical to compete, etc. ","3037":"When assessing a need for intervention, it is of utmost importance to clearly define the scope. On one side, \nthe  definition  of  large  digital  platforms  acting  as  gatekeepers  should  capture  activities  such  as  operating \nsystems, search\/voice assistants, marketplaces\/application stores, online advertising, content sharing and \ncloud services. Also, promising markets for the future should be looked at such as health, home security, \nentertainment,  augmented  reality,  voice  and  image  recognition,  gaming,  online  payment,  identity \nauthentication, IoT and other products and services based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. ","3038":"Orange therefore proposes to define a large digital platform acting as a gatekeeper as a company operating \na structural digital platform and fulfilling the three following mandatory cumulative criteria: \n\uf0a7  Plays an unavoidable trading partner role by controlling the access to markets, services\/inputs and\/or \nusers,  or  by  significantly  affecting  the  functioning  of  markets  where  it  operates  through  exercise  of \ninfluence on third parties\u2019 business activities ","3039":"\uf0a7 \n\uf0a7  The company\u2019s financial value is high and\/or has a strong financial capacity \n\uf0a7  Third parties depend on the platform for their activity  \n\uf0a7  Business model is based on collecting, processing, editing and further monetizing data \n\uf0a7 \n\uf0a7  Has powerful negotiation position creating bargaining power imbalances \n\uf0a7  Consumer decision making is limited due to imposed default settings and conditions \n\uf0a7  Competes with its own business users to supply via its platform \n\uf0a7 ","3040":"Even  though  competition  law  has  proven  to  be  flexible  to  properly  address  different  situations  over \ndecades, it now needs to evolve to be adapted to the specificities of the digital economy so as to efficiently \nand in a timely manner tackle competition problems proper to large digital platforms acting as gatekeepers. ","3041":"In  this  context,  Orange  welcomes  the  European  Commission\u2019s  initiatives  to  review  the  Guidelines  on \nHorizontal  Agreements  and  Vertical  Restraints  as  well  as  Notice  on  Market  Definition.  In  addition,  the \nGuidelines on Non-Horizontal Merger and the Communication on the Commission\u2019s Enforcement Priorities \nin  Applying  Article  102  TFEU  should  be  updated.  Also,  the  Commission  should  develop  new  theories  of \nharm adapting them to the digital platform economy and use existing tools, such as interim measures more \nefficiently.  ","3042":"However,  Orange  acknowledges  that  the  review  of  the  competition  framework  has  its  limits  and  all  the \naforementioned  structural  competition  problems  might  not  be  possible  to  tackle  under  the  existing  tools. \nIndeed, in the digital economy it can be quite challenging to define markets and assess dominance, as large \ndigital platforms have distinctive features, are often present across diverse markets and are integrated in an \necosystem linked through common inputs (data, customer base, technical modules, etc.).  ","3043":"Any  fundamental  change  to  competition  law  as  suggested  in  the  NCT  Inception  Impact  Assessment  (IIA) \nwould be a disproportionate and inappropriate reaction to identified structural competition concerns with a \nrisk to modify the burden of proof, procedural safeguards and even render existing tools redundant. It also \nrisks creating legal uncertainty and regulatory overreach across sectors. In addition, it could be questioned \nwhether Articles 103 and 114 TFEU provide an adequate legal basis for such a tool.  ","3044":"More  specifically,  the  proposal  targets  not  only  large  digital  platforms  to  which  structural  competition \nproblems relate but includes other situations \u2013 including oligopolistic markets - without a solid justification \nas to the inefficiency of the existing tools for such cases. Indeed, oligopolistic markets are not problematic \nper se  as  they  do  not  result  in  inefficient  market  outcomes  by  default.  Potential  competition  concerns \nrelated  to  oligopolistic  markets  are  not  new  and  are  efficiently  addressed  under  the  current  framework. \nAlso,  oligopolistic  markets  do  not  create  structural  competition  problems  such  as  monopolization, \ngatekeeping or tipping and they do not have most of the features defining large digital platforms. ","3045":"Orange  believes  that  a  proportionate  and  efficient  set  of  measures  to  tackle  structural  competition \nproblems  deriving  from  large  digital  platforms  acting  as  gatekeepers  could  be  based  on  the  following \napproach. Such an approach would ensure a smooth interplay between different measures proposed under \nthe NCT and DSA packages as well as consistent and non-contradictory outcomes.  ","3046":"Orange believes that an ex ante tool should be introduced through a list of prohibited practices applied to \nlarge digital platforms acting as gatekeepers.  Such an ex ante regulation would clarify the rules applied to \nlarge digital  platforms and forbid certain  practices which could be  problematic per se when employed by \nsuch actors. This tool, corresponding to Option 3a  of the IIA on the DSA, would be enforced at European \nlevel.  ","3047":"Such  a  list  of  prohibited  practices  could  include  self-preferencing,  pre-installation  of  applications  and \npriority  screen  placements,  discriminatory  access  to  platform  components,  imposition  of  default  settings, \nde facto standards or restrictions on IPR policy, etc. In these cases, the burden of proof would be inversed \nand the conduct would be forbidden per se unless the large digital platform could prove the contrary.  ","3048":"As a necessary complement to competition law enforcement and to the list of prohibited practices, a more \nadapted  intervention  tool  targeted  to  structural  competition  problems  exerted  by  large  digital  platforms \nacting  as  gatekeepers  could  be  introduced.  This  tool  (corresponding  to  Option  3b  of  the  IIA  on  the  DSA) \nshould  include  a  case-by-case  assessment  related  to  competition  problems  deriving  from  large  digital \nplatforms  acting  as  gatekeepers  and  an  imposition  of  tailor-made  remedies,  when  necessary.  Under  this \nnew intervention, no infringement would  be established and no fines would  be imposed. To guarantee an \noverall coherence with the competition doctrine when tackling competition problems proper to large digital \nplatforms, this tool should be introduced through an extension of DG Competition powers. ","3049":"Possible remedies could refer to imposing neutrality between OS\/software and platform services, imposing \ninteroperability  (negotiations  based  on  fair  terms,  unified\/open  APIs  and  open  sources,  personal  data \nportability,  etc.),  forbidding  unfair  business  practices  (tying\/bundling,  exclusivities,  MFN,  abusive  or \nunilateral \"take it or leave it\" conditions, etc.), forbidding leveraging of data\/customer base if not replicable \nand certain practices of third party data accumulation, etc.  ","3050":"EMISA aims to give independent operators a voice, in order to achieve fair competition and a \nlevel playing field in the marine diesel engine and related equipment markets.

However, \nthese  OEMs  are  obviously  no  neutral  experts.  They  are  market  players  with  their  own \ncommercial interests.

This  is  fundamentally  threatening  the  very  existence  of  the \nindependent aftermarket.

","3062":"European  retail  markets  are  in  a  delicate  position  where  the  advancing  use  of  retail \ntechnology  and  the  increasing  reliance  by  consumers  on  online  retailing  pose  a  significant \nrisk  to  the  structure  and  competitiveness  of  markets  that  could  quickly  tip  towards  being \nhighly concentrated and dominated by technology giants and very large retail players with \nstrong omnichannel retail capabilities.  This tippy market challenge is new to retailing, where \ntraditionally market structures change slowly depending on the flow of store openings and \nclosures.    However,  in  this  New  Retail  era,  retail  growth  or  demise  can  be  sudden  and \ndepend fundamentally on the appeal of online operations.   ","3063":"In such circumstances, small differences in competitive positions can be magnified and there \nhas never been a greater need to ensure a level playing field where all retailers are able to \ncompete  on  even  terms  and  are  not  competitively  disadvantaged  by  the  way  that \ncompetition  policy  operates.  Unfortunately,  current  EU  competition  policy  does  not  allow \nfor such a level playing field because of the way it risks curtailing the competitive behaviour \nof  independent  retailer  groups,  which  are  an  important  economic  force  across  European \nretail markets helping to ensure that consumers are well served and benefit from effective \ncompetition.   ","3064":"In  the  new  retail  era  independent  retailer  groups  will  need  to  operate  more  as  cohesive \nretail  organisations  and  unified  systems  when  competing  directly  with  fully  (vertically  and \nhorizontally)  integrated  retailers.    However,  EU  competition  policy  treats  independent \nretailer  groups  -  unless  they  constitute economic  units  -  differently  because  the  individual \nretail  outlet  operations  belonging  to  the  relevant  groups  are  owned  and  controlled  by \nindependent SME retail entrepreneurs rather than being centrally owned and managed.  The \nresult  is  unfair  and  discriminatory  policy  treatment  that  tilts  the  playing  field  in  favour  of \nintegrated retailers and retail technology giants. The effects of the difference in treatment \nare  amplified  in  the  New Retail era where  online  and  omnichannel  retailing  have  come  to \nthe fore.

Principally, as interpreted in the EC guidelines, \nArticle 101 (1) TFEU  prevents  independent retailer groups  from  using common pricing  and \nother coordination practices open to integrated retailers online.  In the New Retail era, these \nlegal  obstacles  serve  to  distort,  restrict  and  prevent  competition  in  favour  of  integrated \nretailers  and  retail  tech  giants  to  a  much  higher  degree  than  before  because  they  are \nessential to an efficient, fully coordinated, data analytic driven multichannel retail system.

Specifically,  in  comparing \noffers across different retailers, consumers want to be able to search easily for the best price \nand  value,  so  having  a  consistent  and  clear  price  is  critical  to  aiding  the  consumer  search \nprocess.    Helping  clarify  to  the  consumer  a  single  price  on  offer  helps  the  retailer  secure \nsales  while  also  allowing  for  rapidly  adapting  the  price  to  cater  for  changing  competitive \ncircumstance and promoting a consistent price image for the group.  For practical purposes, \nhaving a common price also helps the group to appear in online search price rankings while \nensuring that store prices match consumers\u2019 expectations based on the online information, \nagain  facilitating  the  consumer\u2019s  search  process.

Permitting  independent  retailer  groups  to  set  common  uniform \nprices for online (and, where necessary, offline) sales would help improve brand consistency \nand  give  consumers  the  assurance  of  obtaining  the  best  price  from  the  store  network.  \nSimilarly, allowing independent retailer groups to share information on sales and prescribe \nproduct  ranges  would  help  improve  the  efficiency  of  logistics,  stock  replenishment  and \nsupply operations along with assuring local product availability for the benefit of consumers.

Instead, an independent retailer group is restricted in these \naspects  even  if  the  group  serves  as  a  single  coordinated  organisation  or  unified  system \nbecause  of  the  separate  legal  ownership  of  the  stores  or  the  businesses  run  from  the \nindividual stores.  The result is unfair and discriminatory policy treatment in respect of how \nEC  competition  law  rules  are  applied  to  these  independent  retailer  groups  vis-\u00e0-vis  the \nliberal approach afforded to integrated retailers and retail tech giants.

The common \nelement is that members have a dual role as both customers of the cooperative (in \nbuying  goods)  as  well  as  co-owners  (through  share  ownership).    Such  groups  are \nimportant  in  France  (e.g.  E.  Leclerc,  ITM  Intermarche,  and  Syst\u00e8me  U)  and  in \nGermany (e.g. EDEKA and REWE Group).

The  latter  is  common,  for  example,  in \nthe  car  sector  where  specific  competition  policy  and  block  exemption  rules  apply  to \nselective and exclusive distribution arrangements involved in car supply  and distribution \nin the EU.  More generally for franchising arrangements, the franchisor grants permission \nfor the franchisee (the independent retailer) to sell its products or services as a means of \nselective  distribution.    The  franchisor  also  provides  a  proven  method  of  trading,  plus \nsupport  and  advice  in  setting  up  and  operating  the business  (e.g.  Benetton,  Body  Shop, \nMango,  and  Swarovski).    The  contractual  arrangement  allows  the  franchisor  to  obtain \ndistribution at the retail level through its dealers while maintaining vertical control in how \nthe retail service and its goods are merchandised. Even so, franchisors may be limited in \nthe extent  to which they can exercise  complete  control over franchisees.  Thus, while  a \nfranchisor may be able to impose certain restrictions on a franchisee to protect property \nrights  and ensure  necessary  investments  are made, it cannot  legally tie  the purchase  of \ninputs  to  use  of  the  franchise.    Equally,  while  the  franchisor  may  specify  the  quality  of \ninputs to be used, a franchisee must be free to buy from a third party that can meet the \nspecific standards of the inputs.

Designed to protect smaller retailers, the \u2018Royer\u2019 law ultimately \ncontributed  to  the  rise  of  discount  stores.

Centralising online sales on a platform managed by the group is just one of the \nmany areas of progress essential to surviving in a highly competitive market. ","3186":"\u25a1 \nInitial  conclusion:  This  quick  historical  recap  shows  that  individual  independent \nretailers have had no choice but to form groups and continually adapt them to changing \nmarket circumstances in order to grow and succeed in a competitive market.  The actions \nthey have taken as part of a group allowed them to survive in highly competitive markets ","3187":"Fragility of the groups linked to the free right of withdrawal of the shareholder trader \nIndependent retailer groups are inherently fragile organisations because each shareholder \ntrader  has  the  free  right  to  exit  the  group.    In this  regard,  traders  belonging  to  a  group \nhold capital shares in the group (or social shares in the case of groupings in cooperative or \nmutual form).  Through shareholder status (or as a cooperating partner or member), each \ntrader benefits from the activities of the group.  As the trader is independent, it is free to \nwithdraw, to obtain the refund of its social shares or capital shares, and therefore to leave \nthe group and its network, at any time.

Similarly, franchise-type contractual distribution \nnetworks,  which  are  made  up  of  independents,  are  also  not  in  the  same  situation  of \nfragility because the loss of shareholder\/partner status breaks the contract, regardless of \nits duration, and the franchisor can seek to find a replacement franchisee. ","3190":"Validation of the mechanisms limiting the right of withdrawal \nIn  order  to  reassure  their  suppliers  and  their  banks,  while  deploying  the  investment \nstrategies  necessary  to  remain  competitive,  traders  within  the  same  group  generally \nagree  to  limit  their  own  right  of  withdrawal  by  committing  themselves  to  remain  a \nshareholder\/partner  for  a  certain  duration.    When  exercising  their  right  of  withdrawal \nbefore this agreed deadline, they pay compensation. ","3191":"French  case  law  validates  this  mechanism  for  limiting  the  right  of  withdrawal  of  the \nshareholder  trader.    The  law  recognises  that  the  departure  of  a  trader  weakens  the \ncapacity  of  the  group,  and  leaves  to  other  merchant  traders  to  cover  the  share  of  the \nexpenses and the financing of the investments that the retiring or excluded trader will no \nlonger assume, and from which it benefited. ","3192":"It  therefore  appears  normal  and  legitimate  that,  in order to  ensure  the sustainability  of \nthe  group\u2019s  membership,  the  group  should  set  up  compensatory  mechanisms,  namely \nthat the trader who withdraws offsets the consequences of its premature departure and \nthus preserves the other traders from the consequences of this departure.  This principle \nemerges  clearly  through  case  law  (e.g.  Paris,  2  October  2008,  5th  Ch.B,  n  \u00b0  06\/15.920; \nVersailles,  12  June  2001,  12th  Chamber  Section  1,  RG  n  \u00b0  99\/03314;  Versailles,  12th \nChamber 2nd Section, 27 March 1997, RG No. 5279\/95; Reims, Civil Chamber, 1st Section, \nMarch 5, 2003, RG 98\/1404; Versailles, 12th Chamber 2nd Section l, October 26, 1995, RG \n8143\/94, 8865\/94, 8916 \/ 94).

This  article  puts  an  end  to  the  practice,  denounced  by  the  French \nCompetition  Authority,  for  franchise  contracts  whose  \"cross-duration\"  prevents  the \ntermination  of  the  relationship,  with  intention  to  promote  competition  and  provide \ngreater protection for franchisees, as perceived vulnerable parties.

For  this  reason,  any  such  contracts  concluded  between  the  group  and  its \nmembers are also of indefinite duration or tacitly renewed.   The legislator has taken into \naccount  this  specific  characteristic  of  groups  of  independent  traders  by  excluding  the \napplication  of  the  rule  of  common  expiry  of  the  \"contract  of  association  and  the  civil, \ncommercial or cooperative association contract\" (C. com., L. 341 -1, paragraph 3).

They have accelerated the dissemination of various kinds of problematic content such as some forms\nof \u2018hate speech\u2019 and \u2018disinformation\u2019.","3212":"In addition, the major social media platforms act as gatekeepers in the social media markets.  They control\neconomic  actors\u2019 access  to  the  users  and  are  able   to  raise  barriers   to  entry   for  competitors.  As  such,  they\ndetermine the competition dynamics in the market and in the aftermarkets. On the one hand, economic actors\nthat want access to the users have to accept the conditions imposed by the gatekeepers; on the other hand,\ngatekeepers deprive users of viable alternatives.","3213":"ARTICLE 19 is particularly concerned by the fact that social media gatekeepers act not only as \u201ceconomic\u201d\ngatekeepers, but also as \u201chuman rights\u201d gatekeepers, with particular impact on the right freedom of expression\nand information, and the right to privacy. This manifests itself in two ways. First is the companies' ability to\ndictate standard terms of service (ToS) for their users and to implement content moderation policies that are\ncritical in terms of freedom of expression standards. Second, it also raises concerns where governments are able\nto pressure these gatekeepers into changing their ToS or policies in way which is not compliant with human\nrights.","3214":"Moreover, at a community level, social media platforms with high market power can exert decisive influence on\npublic debate, which raises issues in relation to diversity and pluralisms in the online environment.

Therefore, our\nproposal aims to fix challenges with content curation by diminishing concentration of power in the market and\nby lowering barriers to entry for alternative curation services.","3216":"Although hosting and curation activities are currently provided as a bundle by the vast majority of social media\nplatforms, this does not need to be the case, and it is not something irreversible.

This would oblige social media platforms with\nsignificant market power to unbundle hosting and content curation activities, and allow third parties to offer\ncontent curation to the platforms\u2019 users. As a way of example, what we envisage is that a user that creates or has\na profile on Facebook would be asked by the platform whether they want the content  curation  service to be\nprovided by Facebook itself, or by other players to be freely selected. The option to stay with the dominant\nplatform   should   be   presented   as   opt-in,   rather   than   opt-out.   We   believe   that   opt   in  default   is   more   pro-\ncompetitive and reduces switching costs (and therefore also  avoid that platforms undermine the effects of the\nunbundling by making the switching hard for users and by nudging them towards a locked-in situation).","3219":"ARTICLE 19 calls for an asymmetric remedy. We believe that such remedy should be imposed on platforms that\nhave a gatekeeping position or a position of market strength that, irrespective of whether it can be defined as\ndominance under competition rules,  it  allows   the  platform  to  raise  barriers  to entry,  determine   competition\ndynamics in the market, and deprive users of viable alternatives.","3220":"We recommend a form of functional separation, not a structural one. In addition, the platform that provides the\nhosting should remain free to offer content curation too. What changes is that the platform should keep the two\nservices   separate   and   provide   competitors   the   possibility   to  offer  the  curation  service   on   its  platform;  the\nplatform must also allow users to freely choose among service providers.","3221":"The unbundling remedy should be designed to address the contractual layer (contractual agreements between the\nplatforms with significant market power and the alternative players that provide content curation services to the\nplatforms' users) and the technical layer (how to make this technically possible while ensuring data protection,\nconsumer protection and security).","3222":"\uf0b7 For the technical layer, we believe the more efficient solution to be that platforms should open a curation\nApplication Programming Interface (API) to potential competitors. As such, the efficacy of the unbundling\nremedy   is   based   on   the  adoption   of   interoperability   solutions,   whose  details   should   be   defined   by   the\nregulator, guided by independent experts with the relevant knowledge and in cooperation with the platform\nin   order   to   deal   with   the   substantial   information   asymmetries   in   the   market.   Indeed,   as   explained   by\ndistinguished  academic experts,  various  types  of   interoperability  exist, and  each of  them   could best   fit\ndifferent situations and needs2.","3223":"ARTICLE 19 suggests that unbundling is  a  highly pro-competition  remedy:  it opens the market for content\ncuration and relies on competition among players to deliver more choices and better-quality services to users.\nTherefore, the unbundling is also capable of addressing the market failures mentioned above. Furthermore, the\nremedy we suggest is not a novelty in the history of economic regulation; on the contrary, it has been often used\nin network industries, and especially in the telecom sector, in order to enhance competition and stimulate market\nentry.","3224":"Moreover, the unbundling is less invasive or paternalistic than other instruments to address challenges related to\ncontent curation, such as imposing specific curation policies or establishing \u2018must carry\u2019 obligations. It interferes\nonly limitedly on  digital platforms' freedom of economic activities and  it empowers users to make their own\nchoices, rather than imposing strict standards on the market.","3225":"\uf0b7 We suggest  an asymmetric obligation, to  be imposed  on social  media platforms  with  a gatekeeping\nposition or a position of market strength;\n\uf0b7 The unbundling should  be coupled  with  the   obligation  to  provide   access  based  on  fair,  reasonable,\ntransparent and non-discriminatory grounds, and with the necessary interoperability requirements;\n\uf0b7 The remedy should allow users to freely select the content curation provider of their choice.","3226":"The European Shippers\u2019 Council represents the interests of more than 75.000 cargo owners in the \nEuropean Union, both SMEs and large multinational companies.

Indeed,  it is conceivable that the market share of a consortium may exceed the BER \nthreshold on a given trade lane and at the same time, be below the threshold on another \ntrade lane. This poses the question if a consortium may credibly claim the benefits of the BER \non the trade lane where its market share is below the BER threshold; whilst operating outside \nthe BER. Additionally, subject to Article 101 TFEU on the trade lane where its market share \nexceeds  the  BER  threshold,  it  is  also  necessary  to  clarify  the  provision  on  exceeding  the \nthreshold longer than what the regulation mentions as two consecutive calendar years. ","3239":"Consortia members will have necessarily acquired  significant knowledge  of business sensi-\ntive information and practices of each other when operating on a given trade lane under the \nbenefits of the BER and this fact makes it difficult to accept that they compete at arm\u2019s length \nagainst each other on the trade lane where the BER threshold requirement is not met.   In \nsuch circumstances, it would strongly appear that the benefit of the BER should not be avail-\nable  to  consortium  members,  also  with  regard  to  the  trade  lane  where  the  consortium\u2019s  \nmarket share satisfies the BER requirements.

Namely, these two forms were structural risks for competition (e.g., network and lock-in effects, tipping markets) and the structural lack of competition (e.g., oligopolistic market structure with an increased risk of tacit collusion. \nAs previously mentioned, the App Association represents over 5,000 small and medium-sized app developers operating in the highly competitive market of the global app economy. A recent study showed that the app economy generated 187\u20ac billion in direct and indirect revenues just in the European Union. 86\u20ac billion of this revenue benefitted app developers directly (https:\/\/actonline.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Deloitte-The-App-Economy-in-the-EU-2020.pdf). \nThe market structure of the app economy is complex and involves few large players operating app stores, through which both our members and their customers are able to connect. The App Association believes that such a market structure enhances competition and consumer benefits. In fact, in the case of the app economy, structural market elements such as concentrated markets (A), large economies of scale and scope (J), strong direct and indirect network effects (K and L), and significant financial strength (O) ultimately boost competition and innovation and help the app economy thrive. \nIn the app ecosystem, the market feature of strong indirect network effects (L) is vital for both consumers and app developers. It allows both respectively to enjoy a broad choice of services and reach a broad consumer audience. Similarly, large economies of scale (J) in the app stores have impacted app developers very positively. With their low entry barriers, platforms help app makers to reach international markets and to gain consumer trust instantly, despite small developers' often limited resources. This ability to scale up is particularly important for those small businesses that cannot afford costly and complex business strategies, payment structures and marketing. \nThe App Association further underscores that these market features result in enhanced competition and innovation at all levels of the market. Both small and large players are constantly challenged to innovate in order to retain competitiveness and consumer trust in the app economy.The App Association is concerned by several of the characterisations above. The question assumes a structural competition problem. Some of the definitions are reductionist and simplify highly complex market dynamics too much. We will proceed by addressing each scenario briefly below. ","3247":"First, we do not consider the fact of extending core market activity into adjacent markets as an inherent cause of structural competition problems. On the contrary, the ability for a company to extend its activities into related markets is more likely to indicate a healthy ecosystem, with innovation and competition at its core. Companies that are 'not necessarily dominant' are, therefore, more likely to bring benefits to the market than harm. Similar behaviour by dominant companies is also unlikely to result in structural competition problem. As it is understood in European competition law, the concept of dominance indicates that a company has the capacity to distort competition, especially in narrow market segments. However, it is only the abuse of dominance that is likely to bring harm. The European Commission already has a number of tools at is disposal to address such abuses. It is, therefore, also unlikely that a company abusing a position of dominance would be bale to generate structural competition problems before being held to account. The App association, thus, maintains that there is no reason to believe this market scenario inherently qualifies as a structural competition problem.","3248":"Second, the App Association finds concern with the definition used by the Commission to describe anti-competitive monopolisation. Namely, the definition as a situation in which one market player is able to rapidly acquire market share due to its 'capacity to put competitors at a disadvantage in the market unfairly' risks legal uncertainty. Specifically, we believe that the concept of fairness is ambiguous and should be defined further by the Commission. We are also under the impression that the described situation is already captured by current competition rules. Anti-competitive monopolisation is, therefore, unlikely to result in structural competition problems before the responsible company is brought to account. ","3249":"Third, behavioural alignment occurs in all sorts of markets and is the natural result of companies monitoring their competitors in order to offer the most desirable products to consumers. When such alignment occurs through unilateral conduct, it is not anticompetitive. The situation differs considerably if companies are engaging in collusion. However, this issue is also already captured by the existing tools of the European Commission. The remainder of this market scenario seems to suggest that highly concentrated markets on their own may lead to structural competition problems. However, the App Association believes that even in highly concentrated markets, such as app stores, competition and innovation thrive. We question the presumed relationship between highly concentrated markets and the alignment of market behavior. The App Association considers neither scenario to be likely to create structural competition problems. ","3250":"Fourth, the App Association understands that a situation in which a single company is able to unilaterally determine market dynamics may lead to competition problems. However, it is unclear how realistic such a concern may be. Even the most powerful companies do not exist in a vacuum and must compete against each other as well as new market entrants. Therefore, even if a significant number of consumers choose to single-home, there are likely external dynamics that act as a check on a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019s\u2019 power. Also as previously noted, in multi-sided markets like the platform economy, just the threat of a small group of consumers leaving increases competitive pressures. Additionally, single-homing can be beneficial for consumers as it can increase consumer welfare. We suspect that such scenarios will require case-specific analysis in order to determine the degree to which \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 could cause structural competition issues. ","3251":"Last, the App association does not consider 'tipping markets' to be problematic in the context of the app ecosystem. One incentive for small developers to spend money on growth and innovation is the promise of subsequent recovery of funds once sufficient scale is achieved. Additionally, as previously stated, the strong cross-side network effects of the app stores are a key element of the multi-sided app economy and they benefit not only the app stores but developers and consumers as well. We advise the Commission against taking too broad of an approach to this and the previous market scenario, as they will need to be evaluated thoroughly on a case-by-case basis that takes into account the unique and complex dynamics of each sector.When it comes to the digital economy, the list of companies employing such strategies is considerably smaller, and their efforts are not always effective. Consider, for example, the invite-only Google+ platform, launched by Google in June 2011. This platform included typical features of social networks, in an effort to compete with Facebook, among other sites. However, in 2018, Google+ disappeared from the internet, following low usage and engagement from consumers, and its general inability to compete with other companies in this market segment. Apart from highlighting how the extension of market power into adjacent sectors is not always effective, this example also demonstrates that 'relying on large amounts of data' does not necessarily benefit companies that wish to expand, since even with all the data at its disposal, Google was unsuccessful in this venture. ","3252":"It is also worth recalling that it is common for smaller - and certainly not dominant - companies in the digital economy to diversify their services in an effort to increase their likelihood of successful market entry. The European Commission itself noted in its 2019 report on 'Competition Policy for the Digital Era', that 'competition comes through niches as a new platform offers some services which are not offered through a dominant platform, operates in adjacent markets, or, when technically possible offers services which complement those of the main platform' (p. 37). It is thus by expanding into adjacent markets that small. market players may successfully challenge larger ones.As previously outlined, the App Association believes that when a firm has transferable skills and resources, leveraging those skills to enter related markets leads to increased competition and better outcomes for consumers. We believe that the use of existing competences leads to enhanced innovation and would urge the Commission to encourage the development of such transferrable skills, particularly for start-ups and SMEs, rather than inhibit such practices.The App Association does not consider that repeated strategies by companies with market power to extend their market position into related markets leads to structural competition problems. If the European Commission is concerned about problems that may arise due to a company's abuse of its dominant position, then it already has adequate tools under the existing competition framework to address any perceived harms before they cause structural damage to the market.Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) prohibits the abuse its dominant position by a company. Art. 102 TFEU does not attempt to exhaustively list potential abuses and provides the Commission and jurisdictions a margin of maneuver and flexibility when addressing anti-competitive behaviour. This flexibility is important in order to permit a case-by-case analysis of potential abuse which is necessary to determine whether specific conduct may be pro- or anti-competitive. \nThe Commission has a already demonstrated the efficacy of Art. 102 TFEU when it comes to the digital sector. On 27 June 2017, the Commission sanctioned Google for na abause of dominant position in the framework of Art. 102 TFEU, upon determining that Google favoured the positioning anode display of its own comparison-shopping service on its general search pages (Case AT. 39740 - Google Search (Shopping), Commission Decision of 27 June 2017). More recently, on 18 July 2018, the Commission found that Google abused its dominant position again in the framework of Art. 102 TFEU by tying its Google search app to its Play Store (Case AT 40099 - Google Android, Commission decision of 18 July 2018). In the same decision, the Commission also qualified Google's conditional licensing of the Play Store and the Google Search on hardware manufacturers as an abuse of dominant position. \nEven Executive Vice President of the European Commission Margrethe Vestager, in her speech on Defining Markets in a New Age (https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/commissioners\/2019-2024\/vestager\/announcements\/defining-markets-new-age_en), underlined the sufficiency of existing enforcement tools. She said: 'That\u2019s not to say that we need fundamental changes to the rules themselves. [\u2026] The fundamental motives, like greed and fear, that tempt companies to harm competition are the same as they\u2019ve ever been.' Against this background, the App Association would recommend that the Commission should exercise caution before deciding that a New Competition Tool is actually needed.As mentioned previously in our consultation responses, the App Association is concerned by the definition used by the Commission to describe anti-competitive monopolisation. Specifically, we are concerned that defining this scenario on the basis of fairness risks significant legal uncertainty. ","3253":"That said, the App Association is aware of some past anti-competitive cases more generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector. Case COMP\/39.839 - Telefonica\/Portugal Telecom is one example. However, our understanding is that when such anti-competitive conduct has been determined, the European Commission has been successful at addressing it using existing competition tools. For example, in the Google Android case, the Commission found that Google had abused its dominant position by tying its Google search app to its Play Store under the framework of Art. 102 TFEU (Case AT 40099 - Google Android, Commission Decision of 18 July 2018) and then took appropriate steps to remedy the situation.Please see response to question 10.2The digital sector - and the online platform ecosystem more specifically - is characterised by immense dynamism and change. While some players may appear to be monopolies in a given moment, frequently evolving market dynamics make it incredibly difficult for would-be monopolisers to consolidate power in any lasting way. Facebook, for example, has already forfeited some of its popularity to TikTok, particularly among the younger generation. Meanwhile Twitter, Snapchat and other services provide additional sources of competition for Facebook. Unexpected events, such as COVID-19, may also serve to reorganise the online platform ecosystem. Travel-based websites such as TripAdvisor or AirBnB have suffered marked decreases in internet traffic since the start of the pandemic, while services like Zoom, WebEx, and Houseparty have emerged as new competitive players. This ecosystem is also rife with the memories of fallen giants, such as Blackberry, AOL, or MySpace. This reinforces the notion that players that seem invincible at present may naturally wane as they fail to innovate or compete with new market entrants and\/or foreign competitors. As such natural market changes have been the only constant feature in an ecosystem full of change, the App Association believes that the competition threat of anti-competitive monopolisation actually carries very little weight in the digital sector.If a company acts in an anti-competitive and monopolistic way by imposing unfair business practices or limiting access to key inputs, it naturally raises competition concerns. This should come as no surprise, as such conduct is already captured and addressed by current competition rules. Specifically, anti-competitive agreements are already captured by Art. 101 TFEU, while other practices that may systematically put competitors at a disadvantage in the market could result from an abuse of dominant position (captured by Art. 102 TFEU). The App Association agrees, therefore, that already prohibited anti-competitive practices raise significant competition concerns. We consider the market fortunate that the European Commission already has effective tools at its disposal to address such issues efficiently.The App Association supports the European Commission\u2019s commitment to safeguard competition in the internal market. If anticompetitive monopolisation is observed, the App Association endorses the Commission\u2019s efforts to use the tools already at its disposal to intervene before structural competition problems become entrenched. However, the App Association is concerned about such intervention occurring ex ante without a thorough grasp of competing market dynamics and the unintended consequences that may arise from premature intervention. The App Association would also like to remind the Commission that even the most well-intentioned interventions are often likely to have harmful consequences that trickle through the rest of the digital economy.Please refer to our response to question 10.7The App Association\u2019s members operate in a complex sector of the digital economy that involves different market structures, including highly concentrated app stores. However, the App Association has not observed a situation in which competitors in this market 'move together'. Conversely, the app stores distinguish themselves on their differences, including the app review process, security, and pricing models. While the App Association condemns coordinated behaviour that may turn a few sizable firms into anticompetitive cartels, we do not believe that oligopolistic markets are inherently poised to tip towards tacit collusion due to their concentrated market structure. ","3254":"The App Association considers that a one-size-fits-all approach to the imposition of structural remedies across the digital ecosystem cannot grasp the subtle nuances of complex and interacting modern markets and economies. The currently applicable competition framework, providing for a case-by-case approach, allows considerably more flexibility while providing both legal and economic certainty and visibility. The App Association is concerned that additional intervention in this area may result in unintended consequences for both small companies and the consumer. The present high competition standards of the EU are a major incentive for businesses to establish themselves in Europe and compete on the internal market. Changes to these high standards will likely result in legal and economic uncertainty that would ultimately harm the consumer whom competition rules are designed to protect. For our members, the existing cooperation between developers and platforms represents a symbiotic, mutually beneficial relationship. Maintaining the level-playing field between big and small-sized developers helps to ensure a healthy, competitive, and innovation-friendly ecosystem.The App Association disagrees with the notion that high concentration levels in a market automatically indicate an oligopoly. The ability of competitors to monitor each other\u2019s behaviour may inspire them to develop new products or offer more competitive services. In this respect, the App Association would like to again stress that according to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), unilateral conduct by companies operating in highly concentrated markets is not anticompetitive as such, as opposed to tacit collusion. We believe that even in highly concentrated markets, such as the app stores, competition and innovation thrive, and broad-based regulatory intervention could result in negative, unintended consequences for both small companies and the consumer. While the App Association would be concerned by markets with high entry barriers, little innovation (homogeneity of products), and when consumers are being shown biased information that disrupts the level playing field on which app developers compete, none of these characteristics are currently present in the app economy.The App Association considers that oligopolistic markets as defined by the Commission are more common in other sectors than the digital economy. To mention a few, oligopolistic markets may be observed across value chains, from wholesalers (e.g., tire manufacturing) to retail activities (e.g., grocery retailing), to commoditized industries (e.g., steel), to services (e.g., credit rating), as well as branded goods (e.g., alcoholic beverages). They may also be found in both small, local markets (e.g., retail oil distribution) as well as large ones (e.g., consumer electronics). ","3255":"The App Association notes further that oligopolistic markets are multi-faceted and involve a large diversity of firms, including those that are labour-intensive (e.g., mail-delivery operators) to ones that are capital-intensive (e.g., pharmaceutical industry, banking sector). Moreover, such firms may be vertically integrated (e.g., movie production and distribution) or non-vertically integrated (e.g., athletic sportswear). In brief, oligopolistic markets are ubiquitous and generally not subject to issues of tacit collusion that cause harm to consumer welfare.The App Association supports the Commission\u2019s action to ensure fair competition in the internal market. However, we believe that any form of intervention in a given market on the basis of its market structure is inappropriate, especially if it may reduce the safeguards for companies under the EU competition framework. The App Association considers that the framework of Articles 101 and 102 are sufficiently effective to address potential competition issues arising in oligopolistic markets.","3256":"The App Association would like to again stress that according to the case law of CJEU, unilateral conduct by companies operating in highly concentrated markets is not anticompetitive as such. Indeed, a company cannot be subject to any form of remedy if explicit collusion has not been demonstrated. Once collusion is demonstrated, Articles 101 and 102 provide the appropriate tools to address it. ","3257":"The App Association does not consider that tipping markets are problematic in the context of the app ecosystem, especially as one incentive for small developers to spend money on growth and innovation is the promise of subsequent recovery of funds once sufficient scale is achieved. Plus, as previously stated, the strong cross-side network effects of the app stores are a key element of the multi-sided app economy, benefitting not only the stores but developers and consumers as well. ","3258":"We note further that tipping markets are notoriously difficult to identify ex ante. The App Association would be interested in learning how the European Commission might intend to assess whether a market is in the process of tipping before it actually has, particularly since the critical range for tipping is often a moving target as market potential continues to change as firms grow  (see, for instance, Nicolas Petit, 'Are \u2018FANGs\u2019 Monopolies? A Theory of Competition under Uncertainty', Working Paper, 10.10.19).Many of the above features are characteristics of the app ecosystem. For SMEs and start-ups, strong direct and indirect network effects are particularly beneficial, allowing small developers to reach thousands of new consumers instantly across borders. Instead of making the app market less competitive, a few concentrated app stores, therefore, facilitate market entry and competition between smaller players. This practice is ultimately of greatest benefit to consumers who are able to access millions of very inexpensive or often free apps without needing to search dozens of separate websites. The strong network effects of larger app stores also make it possible for them to invest substantial resources into research and development, allowing them to offer high-quality programming and advertising integration tools, ready-to-use payment and billing services, and other advantages to developers (https:\/\/actonline.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Deloitte-The-App-Economy-in-the-EU-2020.pdf). The level of continued investment in keeping developers engaged shows that there is a high-level of competition in the market from both the platforms' and the developers' point of view.\nSingle-homing can generate consumer welfare as well as it ensures customer trust, a good user experience, high levels of security which are key for consumers and developers. Additionally, since these are multi-sided markets, even if one side of consumers single-homes, if the other set of user(s) multi-home - like developers do on app stores - that generates competitive pressure for online intermediaries to get the best content on their platform. Thus, the combined threat of even a small number of users being ready to switch and multi-homing creates competitive pressure.The App Association stresses that tipping markets as described by the Commission are merely the result of companies successfully competing on their merits and growing organically through innovation. Such markets can accordingly be found in large segments of the economy, including the food service sector (McDonald\u2019s, KFC, or Burger King) or the gaming hardware sector (Nintendo or Sony), and do not necessarily result in a \u2018winners takes most\u2019 scenario. On the contrary, these market structures result in increased investments in innovation and lower prices for the consumer.The App Association does not believe that tipping markets as described by the Commission lead to above listed competition concerns. Please refer to our answers to questions 16.2, 16.4 and 16.6 for details.The App Association considers the notion that certain markets are inherently prone to tipping and result in \u2018winner takes most\u2019 scenarios as described by the Commission to be particularly speculative for the introduction of new legislation. We remain strongly committed to the application and enforcement of currently applicable competition rules prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and abuses of dominant positions. The App Association believes any intervention by the European Commission in such a broad range of sectors and industries is likely to stifle competition between companies in evolving and innovative markets and may create unintended consequences for small- and medium-sized developers. Only anticompetitive practices in the framework of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are able to create sufficient consumer harm to warrant an intervention. Moving the focus of competition policy away from abuse and anticompetitive conduct risks creating legal uncertainty and creating new market problems. Furthermore, interim measures are already an available option in the Commission's competition toolbox.Please refer to our response to question 17.1The App Association does not consider that gatekeeper scenarios are unique to the digital sector. Among other markets, the pharmaceutical industry, insurance sector, or telecom sector may also demonstrate gatekeeping tendencies. Indeed, market players in these sectors enjoy a broad consumer base often characterized by high switching costs.Among other markets, the pharmaceutical industry, insurance sector, or telecom sector may also demonstrate gatekeeping tendencies. Indeed, market players in these sectors enjoy a broad consumer base often characterized by high switching costs.Size and the number of customers\/users do not automatically suggest 'gatekeeper' powers in a given market. In the app market, assessing the relevance of this feature is particularly difficult, as some market segment have a global outreach, while others are very local. Gatekeeper status should be based on anticompetitive behaviour rather than size and popularity with users.","3259":"To an extent, single homing can impede competition. However, we stress that the app market is characterised by strong multi homing, as developers are able to promote the same product in several app stores simultaneously or test innovative features in one store before sharing it in others. Users also do not face high switching costs. Additionally, even the threat of a small group of consumers leaving constitutes a competitive pressure. Since platform markets are multi-sided, if other set of user(s) multi-home, like developers on app stores do, then there is a competitive pressure to get the best content for online intermediaries on their platform. ","3260":"The App Association also considers that unless it is abusive in the framework of Article 102, the need for business operators to accept certain conditions of a platform in order to reach the customers who use that platform, is fundamental for the well-functioning of the app market. Indeed, standard terms and conditions ensure that big and small developers compete on the same terms, while providing consumers with higher levels of legal certainty, privacy, and security. It is through such features that app developers may acquire and maintain consumer trust simply by virtue of being included on a recognised and respected store. The App Association again recalls the anticipated benefits of the P2B Regulation, particularly with respect to terms and conditions in the online platform ecosystem. ","3261":"We also note that standard contracts are very common. We believe they are beneficial in most cases and are only bad if they are filled with abusive clauses, which is only likely to happen if the company in question is abusing its dominant position. Standard terms and conditions, in our opinion, do not constitute the problem, rather the issue is constituted by a dominant platform who abuses its power  to impose harmful terms and conditions that tilt the level playing field and harm innovation.The App Association would like to clarify that the above responses are too general and do not apply to all platforms that may be considered online 'gatekeepers' as some gatekeepers bring significant value to the app economy specifically, guaranteeing certain standards and protections for both developers and consumers. These responses, therefore, are only indicative of the App Association\u2019s thoughts around harmful gatekeepers, who may abuse their position.\n \nEven so, the App Association would like to reiterate that a gatekeeper\u2019s ability to determine certain conditions related to access of a given market, e.g., cybersecurity requirements, do not necessarily determine the dynamics on the platform. Instead, competition dynamics on the app stores are essentially determined by the consumers, who enjoy a broad range of choice, constant innovation, and low prices. ","3262":"The App Association also considers that it is usual in any offline or online business that an intermediary between customers and business users has the right to determine certain terms and conditions for market access. As long as these terms and conditions are not considered abusive as defined in the currently applicable European competition framework, a company\u2019s right to set such terms is protected under its freedom to conduct a business (Article 16 of EU Charter of Fundamental Rights).The App Association urges the Commission to approach the matter of gatekeeping scenarios very narrowly based on evidence of anticompetitive behaviour, and in tandem with a thorough investigation of internal and interrelated market dynamics. ","3263":"In the app economy, the App Association believes that any consumer harm resulting directly from gatekeeper scenarios has not been demonstrated. There is subsequently no need for the Commission to intervene in this sector to address potential structural market problems.The App Association considers that the currently applicable competition rules are still appropriate to preserve and improve competition.As outlined in our previous responses, the App Association has identified similarities with other sectors\/markets for many of the structural competition concerns named by the Commission. However, we do not expect these issues to multiply or escalate in such a way as to require the Commission to depart from its currently applicable competition rules in order to intervene directly in markets. ","3264":"Additionally, the App Association does not consider that any intervention in a market should be based on the mere presence of particular actors, such as gatekeepers. The App Association is further concerned the Commission has not described the specific consumer harms it expects may result from several of these presumed problems.","3265":"The App Association is of the view that Article 101 TFEU provides competition authorities enough flexibility to address anticompetitive effects resulting from anticompetitive agreements, which are particularly harmful to competition and the consumer.  Structural market problems, as such, do not have the potential to distort competition in such manner as to require any further intervention, particularly if performed ex ante.The App Association notes previous decisions taken by the Commission to end anticompetitive practices in the telecom sector, as an example, such as in cases Telekomunikacja Polska (AT.39525), Telef\u00f3nica and Portugal Telecom (AT.398339) or Slovak Telecom (AT.39523). However, in all of these cases, anticompetitive practice caused competition and consumer harm, rather than structural competition problems (e.g., oligopolistic markets).As stated previously, the Commission has already demonstrated the efficacy of Art. 102 TFEU in addressing competition problems. On 27 June 2017, the Commission sanctioned Google for an abuse of dominant position in the framework of Art. 102 TFEU, upon determining that Google favoured the positioning and display of its own comparison-shopping service on its general search pages (Case AT. 39740 \u2013 Google Search (Shopping), Commission Decision of 27 June 2017). More recently, on 18 July 2018, the Commission found that Google abused its dominant position again in the framework of Art. 102 TFEU by tying its Google search app to its Play store (Case AT 40099 \u2013 Google Android, Commission Decision of 18 July 2018). In the same decision, the Commission also qualified Google\u2019s conditional licensing of the Play store and Google search on hardware manufacturers as an abuse of dominant position. Against this background, the App Association considers that Article 102 TFEU is capable of addressing structural competition concerns, preventing potential consumer harm in such markets.-The App Association supports the European Commission\u2019s general objective to safeguard a competitive internal market. We note that the current proposal on the NCT envisages a significant expansion of the Commission\u2019s existing powers, including the potential power to impose extensive behavioural and structural remedies absent an infringement decision. Against this background, the introduction of the NCT is bound to have far-reaching implications and is likely to result in a paradigm shift in EU competition law.  The App Association accordingly calls on the Commission to consider carefully the unintended consequences of such a tool and assess whether such a drastic shift is necessary. We believe the currently applicable framework of Article 101 and 102 TFEU provides the necessary flexibility to address structural competition problems and remains adapted to current and future competition issues.The App Association is particularly concerned about the potential implications that any form of early intervention by competition authorities in a given market could have. The App Association believes that only abuses of dominant position or anticompetitive agreements, such as those addressed by Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, are able to cause sufficient consumer harm to warrant an intervention. Moving the focus of competition policy away from abuse and anticompetitive conduct could deny consumers and society the benefits of healthy competition and create disincentives for non-dominant firms to aggressively compete in a given market, including against dominant firms. Further, any form of early intervention in a market risks creating legal uncertainty that may ultimately harm the consumer and may prevent emerging markets from becoming successful.The App Association is particularly concerned about the legal basis identified by the Commission in order to justify a new competition tool, namely Articles 103 and 114 TFEU. The App Association notes that Article 103 TFEU enables the adoption of legislation to 'give effect to the principles set out in Articles 101 and 102' to address restrictions of competition. In contrast, the NCT would function 'without any prior finding of an infringement' of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. As Member States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, new laws to adapt the application of their competition legislation to digital markets, the Commission\u2019s proposal relates to infringements of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and their national equivalents, as opposed to purportedly problematic market structures. As such, the App Association does not see a need for the approximation of divergent national laws via the NCT pursuant to Article 114 TFEU, nor is there the prospect of divergence in a foreseeable future. The App Association accordingly considers that the Commission\u2019s proposal for an NCT raises possible questions regarding the constitutionality of the Commission\u2019s initiative.","3266":"As noted throughout the consultation, structural competition problems arise in all markets\/sectors. The App Association does not consider that structural competition problems cause sufficient consumer harm to warrant any intervention from European competition authorities. If unavoidable, a broadly applicable NCT (horizontal in nature) would be preferable. The App Association again reiterates that such a tool would imply a significant expansion of the Commission\u2019s existing powers and is bound to have far-reaching implications, with the likely result of a paradigm shift in EU competition law enforcement. The App Association is particularly concerned about the potential legal and economic uncertainty that such a tool would create, and the resulting unintended consequences of such a tool, especially for small and medium-sized businesses across the EU.","3267":"As previously stated, structural competition problems arise in all markets\/sectors. For example, oligopolistic markets can be observed across the value chain, as described in the App Association\u2019s response to question 12.8 above. Further, tipping markets, as described by the Commission, are the result of companies successfully competing on their merits and growing organically through innovation, as described in our response to question 16.6, and do not necessarily result in a 'winner takes most' scenario. The App Association has also stressed in our responses to questions 10.2 and 22.2 that anticompetitive monopolisation practices can be observed in a large range of different markets and are not unique to the digital economy. Therefore, although the App Association does not believe that any intervention is required to address structural competition problems, we would favour an NCT applicable to all markets\/sectors (horizontal in nature).The App Association does not consider that any of the options put forward by the Commission should be included in the NCT. ","3268":"First, the App Association stresses that the European Commission already has the ability to make non-binding recommendations to companies, such as codes of conduct or best practices; the EU Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech is one example. The Commission is also already capable of providing Guidelines as well as binding legislation on the interpretation of currently applicable rules. For example, Commission Regulation (EU) No 330\/2010 of 20 April 2010 on the application of Article 101 (3) TFEU to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices is a binding instrument setting out the criteria for the application of Article 101 (3) TFEU. The Notice on agreements of minor importance which do not appreciably restrict competition under Article 101 (1) TFEU (De Minimis Notice) and the Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 TFEU to horizontal co-operation agreements are two further guidelines established by Commission. ","3269":"Second, the App Association notes that the Commission already makes proposals to sectorial regulators, such as in the field of data protection through the EDPB or the field of Telecoms through the BEREC. Although these institutions constitute independent bodies, they communicate and coordinate on a regular basis with the Commission. It is also clearly established that the Commission works closely with national competition authorities through the framework of the European Competition Network (ECN), which will be reinforced since Member States are currently implementing the ECN+ Directive (and have until 4 February 2021 to do so). ","3270":"Third, the App Association is aware that the Commission is the EU institution that has the monopoly on legislative initiative and is concerned about the Commission proposal to make legislative recommendations on the basis of the NCT. Rather, the ordinary legislative procedure should be applicable to such cases, with the involvement of the two co-legislators, namely the EU Council and the European Parliament. ","3271":"Finally, the App Association is concerned about the possibility for the Commission to impose remedies on companies to deal with identified and demonstrated structural competition problems. Chiefly, the App Association is not clear how the Commission will both identify and demonstrate such structural competition problems, which are both broad and ill-defined concepts. The scope of the potential remedies should also be clearly defined, with the principle of proportionality maintained at the core of any decision. The App Association would also recommend that Commission decisions in this regard be subject to judicial review, and that the burden of proof should remain on the side of the Commission.The App Association does not consider that any of the remedies put forward by the Commission are appropriate in the framework of the NCT. ","3272":"First, non-structural remedies are not appropriate, especially as dominant companies, for instance, already have particular obligations in order to refrain from any abuse of their position under 102 TFEU. Non-structural remedies, e.g., the obligation not to enter into a given market, would disproportionately restrict the freedom to conduct a business (Art. 16 ECFR). ","3273":"Structural remedies are also inappropriate as dominant companies already have the obligation to provide access to key infrastructure to competitors through the Essential Facility doctrine. A recent example is the Commission Decision (2018) in case Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH), in which the Commission fined BEH for blocking access to key gas infrastructure in Bulgaria in breach of Article 102 TFEU. ","3274":"The App Association would like to stress that the app economy in Europe is thriving \u2013 with a total economic impact of \u20ac187.2 billion that created between 1.4-1.7 million jobs in the past year alone, demonstrating robust competition and high demand. The App Association does not believe that the Commission has sufficiently demonstrated that structural competition problems have the potential to cause such consumer harm that it could warrant extreme levels of market intervention\/remedies. We would like to stress that such intervention has the potential to considerably restrict the freedom to conduct a business (Art. 16 ECFR) and would represent a paradigm shift in EU competition law enforcement. The App Association, therefore, rejects the assumption that structural competition problems should be dealt with the structural remedies proposed by the Commission.The App Association believes that there is no need for a new competition tool or additional investigative powers in order to address structural competition problems, which can be dealt with under the currently applicable EU competition framework. The App Association underlines that under Articles 101 and 102, the Commission already enjoys vast investigative powers which are enshrined in Articles 17-21 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1\/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Article 81 and 82 of Treaty (last change on 11.06.2009). ","3275":"Among other powers, these Articles allow the Commission to: (i) request undertakings and associations of undertakings to provide all necessary information; (ii) interview any natural or legal person who consents to be interviewed for the purpose of collecting information relating to the subject-matter of an investigation; (iii) conduct all necessary inspections of undertakings and association of undertakings, such as (a) entering any premises, land, and means of transport of undertakings, or (b) examining books and other records related to business, irrespective of the medium on which they are stored; (iv) inspect other premises, if a reasonable suspicion exists that books or records related to the business and subject-matter of the inspection are being kept in those premises. ","3276":"These powers are already broad, but remain subject to checks and balances that provide companies with legal certainty. Any additional powers, or powers subject to less protective procedural guarantees are not justified for the purpose of the NCT. The App Association stresses further that the anticompetitive effects of violations of Art. 101 and 102 TFEU justify the vast powers listed above. Against this background, the investigative powers of the Commission under the NCT should be proportional to the anticompetitive effects of structural competition problems, and thus remain limited. ","3277":"The App Association notes that the investigative powers proposed by the Commission for the NCT already reflect the existing powers that the Commission enjoys in the framework of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. As already stressed throughout this section, the App Association acknowledges that violations of Articles 101 or 102 TFEU cause important competition and consumer harm. The NCT would depart from the traditional assessment of anticompetitive conduct to address structural market problems. The Commission has not demonstrated that structural market problems have the potential to cause competition and consumer harm that would require the same investigative powers as those in the framework of Article 101 and 102 TFEU.  The App Association accordingly considers that the Commission\u2019s investigative powers under the NCT should be less intrusive and that sanctions and penalties should not be imposed.","3278":"The App Association is in favour of an NCT subject to binding legal deadlines, should the Commission decide to proceed. The App Association notes that a market investigation in the framework of the NCT will likely affect the dynamics in this given market and may interrupt innovation and investments. The App Association thus considers that for the sake of legal and economic certainty and visibility, such investigations should be dealt with in a swift manner, with clear binding deadlines for the Commission to present its findings. Indeed, long investigations into a given market could have severe consequences for the market dynamics and be detrimental to competition and the consumer. The App Association acknowledges that due to the complexities linked to such investigations, a certain amount of time might be needed in order for the Commission to provide a data-driven and evidence-based assessment of structural competition problems.The App Association considers that granting interim measures via the NCT is a particularly powerful tool that may, in limited and exceptional circumstances, be justified. However, the App Association does not consider that structural competition problems have the potential to cause irreparable harm to competition, especially since those problems can be already addressed under currently applicable competition rules. The App Association underlines that the assessment of structural competition problems in a given market is extremely complex and unpredictable, as modern markets permanently evolve and can be of global nature. The grant of interim measures in this context would necessarily be disproportionate to the potential harm to competition and the consumer. The App Association further notes that interim measures have the potential to change market dynamics and even to tear down an entire business, but might later be invalidated.The App Association does not believe that allowing companies the possibility to accept voluntary commitments would be overly intrusive or inappropriate. However, we note that the Commission already has the power to create non-legally binding tools that could help the private sector address the identified problems. The App Association further rejects the possibility for the Commission to impose sanctions or penalties for companies that did not comply with their voluntary commitments.The App Association welcomes the opportunity to address procedural aspects and decision-making processes under the NCT and notes that the Inception Impact Assessment did not provide any details in this regard. The App Association considers that all relevant stakeholders operating in a market under investigation should have the possibility to comment on the findings before the final decision. In particular, the App Association considers that the following criteria should be guaranteed throughout the process: ","3279":"(i) the transparency of the Commission\u2019s process; \n(ii) that parties are given access to decision-makers and the evidence collected by the Commission; \n(iii) that parties receive a fair hearing on the evidence of the case; and \n(iv) that parties are afforded sufficient time to respond to requests for information and\/or intermediate steps in the investigation (e.g., interim reports, statements of objections, etc.). ","3280":"Ultimately, the legitimacy of Commission actions under antitrust law, and the regard in which the Commission is held internationally, derives in part from the legal regime which clearly defines the scope of the Commission\u2019s powers and the European regime of effective judicial protection for parties subject to those procedures. Given the potentially far-reaching implications of the NCT, investigated parties\u2019 procedural rights, and entitlement to judicial protection, cannot be watered down.The App Association considers that the possibility for all relevant stakeholders to comment on the appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies should be guaranteed. The App Association notes that such possibility is at the core of the fundamental legal protection afforded by the EU\u2019s legal order.The App Association reiterates that adequate procedural safeguards, and especially judicial review, are the core of the fundamental legal protection afforded by the EU\u2019s legal order. The App Association notes that judicial review and other procedural safeguards are guaranteed in the framework of investigations under Article 101 and 102 TFEU, violations of which may cause significant competition and consumer harm, in comparison to structural competition problems. The App Association considers that at least the same procedural safeguards should be guaranteed under the NCT. The App Association recommends that with regard to the potentially significant expansion of the Commission powers under the NCT, the highest procedural safeguards should be guaranteed in this framework.We believe that current competition rules provide competition authorities with enough flexibility to address anticompetitive effects resulting from anticompetitive behaviour. The app economy is fair and contestable for innovators, businesses and new market entrants.  The App Association is concerned that additional intervention in this area may result in unintended consequences for both small companies and the consumer. The present high competition standards of the EU are a major incentive for businesses to establish themselves in Europe and compete on the internal market. Changes to these high standards will likely result in legal and economic uncertainty that would ultimately harm the consumer whom competition rules are designed to protect. ","3281":"The currently applicable competition framework, providing for a case-by-case approach, allows considerably more flexibility while providing both legal and economic certainty and visibility. If the Commission decides that there is a need for additional regulation, the framework must allow for the possibility to impose tailored remedies on individual platforms who have demonstrated anticompetitive behavior. No remedies should ever be taken solely because a company may hold 'gatekeeper' power.","3282":"The current discussions and suggested changes to EU competition law are certain due to the \nbehaviour of very few, very large and dominant companies, that all have a direct relation to \nconsumers. This is a very specific area \u2013 best dealt with under the current article 102 TFEU \ntool box - and the issues arising in this setting cannot immediately be transferred to other \nrealities. ","3283":"Competition policy is about applying rules to make sure companies compete fairly with each \nother. This encourages entrepreneurship and efficiency, creates a wider choice for \nconsumers and helps reduce prices and improve quality. The exclusive focus on consumers \nthat is customary under classical competition law pursuant to article 101(3) TFEU cannot be \nthe only yardstick for the assessment of cooperation among producers in the agricultural \nsector.  ","3284":"In this context, we are clearly concerned about the narrowness of the competition test \nenvisaged by this tool, which considers the well-being of the consumer as dependent only on \nthe low price. As far as agri-food products are concerned, this policy has led very clearly to a \ndeflation of the prices of agricultural raw material since these markets have been opened to \ncompetition.  ","3285":"News Media Europe (NME) represents the progressive news media industry in  Europe  \u2013 over 2,500 \nmedia  companies  including  newspapers,  radio,  television  and  internet.  News  Media  Europe  is \ncommitted  to  maintaining  and  promoting  the  freedom  of  the  press,  to  upholding  and  enhancing  the \nfreedom  to  publish,  and  to  championing  the  news  brands,  which  are  one  of  the  most  vital  parts  of \nEurope\u2019s creative industries. ","3286":"News Media Europe welcomes the opportunity to take part in the evidence-gathering \nexercise towards  the Digital Services Act  (DSA) package and the New Competition \nTool (NCT). Our feedback will focus mainly on the review of the intermediary liability \nregime,  the  responsibilities  of  online  intermediaries,  issues  arising  from  digital \ngatekeepers alongside broader structural competition issues in digital markets, and the \nintroduction of a new competition tool.  ","3287":"Press publishers  in particular have  important expectations  associated with the DSA \nand  NCT,  with  the  hope  that  they  will  support  the  key  democratic  function  of \nprofessional journalism in a fair and inclusive digital environment. With this in mind, \nthese  instruments  should  actively  contribute  towards  enhanced  media  freedom and \ncreating a level-playing field between news media and tech companies.  ","3288":"The DSA in particular constitutes a unique opportunity to promote responsible actors \nin the online space by focusing on the regulation of intermediaries. It is clear that such \nintermediaries now play a critical if not systemic role in society across a broad range \nof issues that span beyond mere economic considerations. Indeed, it is crucial that the \nimpact of large platforms on the plurality and sustainability of the media is addressed.  ","3289":"In  our  view,  the  DSA  should  therefore  contribute  to  strengthening  freedom  of \nexpression,  editorial  control,  the  protection  of  journalistic  sources,  and  the  financial \nindependence of journalism, while the NCT should complement a clear set of robust \nex-ante  rules  foreseen  in  the  DSA  package  to  ensure  a  coherent  competition \nframework that can tackle the abusive market conduct of certain platforms. ","3290":"Importantly, the DSA should not undermine existing media-specific legislation such as \nthe Audiovisual Media Services Directive (EU) 2018\/1808 and the Copyright Directive \n(EU)  2019\/790.  If  overlaps  are  inevitable,  they  should  strengthen  media-specific \nregimes, not undermine them, and preserve existing and effective forms of regulation \nwhich continue to prove their effectiveness in maintaining high standards of journalism.  ","3291":"It has become clear over recent years that large and powerful online platforms have \novertaken  media  companies  and  content  producers  in  their  capacity  as  the  main \nbeneficiaries of digital media content1. Certain large online platforms are able through \nintermediation to monetise the biggest share of the value of third-party content, mainly \nthrough advertising.  ","3292":"Indeed, certain online platforms now profit disproportionately from third-party content \nthat  they  do  not  produce,  ultimately  to  the  detriment  of  media  plurality.  That  is \nparticularly true when one considers what the real added value of their service is: mere \nintermediation. Yet with the unique structure of digital markets, platforms are able to \nextract significant excess value from third-party content that sits in sharp contrast with \nthe actual value they offer.  ","3293":"This  means  that  it  has  become  much  more  difficult  to  develop  self-sufficient, \nsustainable businesses in the news industry, which also undermines the ability of the \nmarket to sustain more companies and therefore greater media plurality in the form of \nhigher  participation  in  the  market.  That,  in  turn,  has  been  a  key  driver  of  growth  in \nmarket concentration since economies of scale have become a necessity to maintain \nprofitability.  ","3294":"Overall, this broader shift in the allocation of profits along the media value-chain has \ncreated  a  serious  and  fundamental  problem.  The  profits  derived  from  monetising \ncontent are no longer flowing back to media companies and producers of content, and \ninstead stay within platforms ecosystems, which in turn further undermines business \nmodels and content production in the broader media sector.  ","3295":"Ultimately, unless a direct and fair split approach to advertising revenues derived from \nmonetisation of third party content is adopted, or some form of \u201cnew deal for online \nmedia\u201d is achieved, it is very likely that problems related to funding of media content \nwill persist and worsen, in particular when it comes to news content because it is so \nreliant on advertising for funding in the first place2.  ","3296":"This is of course a deeply flawed reasoning and demonstrates poor judgement and a \nlack of consideration for other non-commercial concerns of a broader, social value. \nThis line of reasoning also completely ignores and dismisses the fact that it is third \nparty  content,  including  journalistic  content,  that  brings  users  in  the  first  place  to \nplatforms.  ","3297":"While  the  ability  of  the  biggest  technology  platforms  to  act  independently  of  other \nmarket  participants  increases,  they  also  play  an  important  role  in  defining  future \nformats for digital content and are already attempting to unilaterally dictate and shape \nthe  future  of  news,  powered  through  artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning. \nGoogle\u2019s  Google  Assistant  and  Amazon\u2019s  Alexa  voice-based  assistant  are  good \nexamples of this3.  ","3298":"Such  products  already  show  that  providing  traffic,  advertising  revenues,  brand \nattribution  or  any  form  of  payment  or  remuneration  if  any  to  media  companies  and \ncontent  producers,  are  not  concerns  at  all.  This  is  deeply  concerning  for  several \nreasons as it reinforces the abusive cycle of exploitation of third-party content along \nlines that undermine the principle of fair market competition on the merits.  ","3299":"The scope of the DSA and its liability regime should not cover news content producers, \npress  publications  and  works  of  a  journalistic  nature.  The  news  sector  already  has \neffective  mechanisms  in  place  to  deal  with  content-based  issues.  In  particular,  the \nnewspapers  industry  is  subject  to  independent  regulators\u2019  scrutiny  that  set  high \nstandards of journalism as well as restrictions above and beyond the law. Therefore, \nthe DSA should focus exclusively on online intermediaries. Our comments will focus \non the following aspects of the liability regime: ","3300":"The experience of news publishers in dealing with illegal content online includes illegal \nadvertising, defamatory statements, intellectual property infringements and others, but \noften  focuses  on  copyright  violations,  which we  will  use  as  a  basis  to  illustrate  and \ndiscuss  a  typical  reporting  procedure  and  the  measures  that  may  consequently  be \ntaken. We wish to stress that the DSA should not try to re-write the Copyright Directive \n(EU) 2019\/790, but rather address situations unforeseen by the law so far. ","3301":"Generally speaking, infringers are genuinely not aware of copyright law and most of \nthem will  remove the content upon notification \u2013 with or without some persuasion  \u2013 \nwhile only a few will refuse to take action. The situation becomes more complex when \nthe unlawful reproduction takes place in closed social media groups (e.g. Facebook, \nWhatsApp, Telegram) since it is difficult to identify the unlawful reproduction of content \nor  the  person  responsible  for  the  group.  Once  the  administrator  is  identified,  press \npublishers are only able to contact the administrator through the  messaging service \n(e.g. Messenger). Yet the message can simply be ignored, which brings an end to the \nprocedure.  As more social media groups turn private or closed, i.e. you need to be \napproved as a member to see what is posted within the group, it becomes increasingly \ndifficult for rightsholders to monitor illegal reproductions. ","3302":"Another  option  is  to  contact  the  online  intermediary.  News  producers  or  their \nrepresentatives  can  send  the  intermediary  a  warning  letter  which  would  typically \nprovide detailed information about which laws are being violated, clear  examples of \nviolations on the website or the platform, which solutions are available and the steps \nto take to implement these solutions. The warning letter would give the opportunity to \neither  remove  the  content,  conclude  a  license  or  change  the  content  into  a  lawful \nformat. When no action is taken, a settlement is sent out.  ","3303":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe experience of news publishers is that reporting procedures are excessively time-\nconsuming and that by the time they are concluded, illegal content is uploaded multiple \ntimes and broadly disseminated. Filling in a form for every infringing upload is simply \nimpossible. Press publishers could spend  infinite resources filling in complaints and \nyet  only  a  marginal  number  of  infringements  would  be  addressed  on  large  social \nnetworks.   ","3304":"\u2022  Transparent  and  productive  communication  between  the  notifier  and  the \nintermediary with a direct line, in the same time zone as the notifier and in the \nlocal  language.  We  are  of  the  view  that  platforms  could  be  much  more \ntransparent with rightsholders, the same way that users who post illegal content \nare informed on why their posts are removed from a page. ","3305":"\u2022  Building up on the recent CJEU case law4, a stay-down obligation, preventing \nreappearance of the illegal content once and for all. The Court ruled that an \nintermediary \u201ccan be ordered to remove content identical and equivalent to that \nfound  illegal\u201d  and  that  such  injunction  may  produce  effects  \u201cworldwide\u201d.  We \nthink this is positive development insofar as the rightsholder would only have \nto  notify  one  illegal  upload  to  have  all  \u201cidentical  or  equivalent  infringing \ncontents\u201d removed across borders or on all the company\u2019s services.  ","3306":"When discussing how such an outcome may be achieved, it is necessary to take due \nconsideration for the ban on general monitoring obligations. While the general ban is \nwell-founded, it should not be used by platforms to turn a blind eye on illegal content \ncirculating on their services.  The Internet of today brings risks that did not exist at the \ntime when the ECD was adopted more than twenty years ago. Therefore, it is important \nto  acknowledge  that  a  certain  degree  of  monitoring  obligation  is  desirable  and \nnecessary  to  make  platforms  more  accountable  towards  business  partners,  public \nauthorities and most importantly the safety of users.  ","3307":"While  we  believe  that  the  protection  of  fundamental  rights  online  is  crucial  -  an \nargument that our own industry is particularly receptive to - we think that technologies \nand  human  review  working  together  can  provide  the  right  balance  to  content \nmoderation  and  should  form  the  basis  for  further  work  in  this  area.  Supporting \ntechnologies are important in the fight against illegal content  and bring added-value \neven  when human intervention  and oversight  remain relevant  to provide a nuanced \nassessment.  ","3308":"Second, when it comes to the liability exemptions, the distinction between passive and \nactive hosts (Recital 42) is of crucial importance since it determines whether a host \nmay benefit from the safe harbour. However, experience shows that the distinction is \nrather unclear and does not encourage platforms to become (pro)active due to the risk \nof not qualifying for the exemptions, and can lead to inconsistent application of the law. \nThis  ambiguity  also  makes  it  difficult  for  press  publishers  to  start legal  proceedings \nwhen they believe there is an online infringement.  Furthermore, we expect that  this \ndichotomy will only become more uncertain as business models evolve. It is therefore \nimportant that the DSA addresses this issue. ","3309":" \n \n \n \n \n\fWe  propose  to  clarify  that  an  intermediary  may  be  \u201cactive\u201d  whenever  it  performs \n\u201ccuration\u201d, meaning, when it plays an active role towards the content it hosts. Curation \nfor  instance  happens  when  content  is  presented  in  an  attractive  way,  categorised, \nselected or promoted, and can involve some degree of control over content. Hence \ncuration  is  important  because  it  implies  some  degree  of  knowledge  about  content, \nwhich in turn can determine liability according to the existing framework.  ","3310":"Having said this, we wish to highlight that it is crucial to distinguish between \u201ccuration\u201d \nand \u201ccontent creation\u201d. Online intermediaries are not content producers even though \nthey increasingly curate third party content. To put it simply, social media and editorial \nmedia operate under different business models, with different purposes, and thus call \nfor distinct legal qualifications and regimes.  ","3311":"An editorial media, such as a press publisher or a news broadcaster, is one that is \nprimarily liable for its own content. This includes situations where the editorial media \npublishes and takes responsibility for a third party\u2019s content (e.g. a letter to the editor-\nin-chief, an opinion, etc). Concretely, press publishers that have editorial control over \ntheir own Internet publications do not benefit from the liability exemptions of Article 14 \nECD because they do not act as intermediaries5. Therefore, news media is primarily \nand fully liable for the content it produces. On the other hand, a social media hosts and \ndistributes content uploaded by its users: it is already secondarily liable for third party \ncontent and can benefit from the ECD liability exemptions under certain conditions. ","3312":"Now, the distinction becomes more and more blurry as business models evolve on \nboth sides. Social media increasingly curates third party content to propose tailored \npages. While editorial media increasingly introduces User-Generated Content (UGC) \nby  encouraging  readers  and  viewers  to  engage  with  news  rather  than  passively \nconsuming it, e.g. when uploading the video of a witnessed event, commenting through \nlive chats, etc. However, the business model for social media is essentially based on \nUGC  whereas  editorial  media  incorporates  UGC  as  an  accessory  to  illustrate  or \ncomment its own editorial content. The DSA should therefore define a liability regime \nfor social media different from that of editorial news media.  ","3313":"For  practical  reasons,  there  is  strong  merit  in  considering  whether  creating  new \ncategories of hosting services, such as \u201csocial networks\u201d that are in practice in between \npublishers and distributors, which would be accompanied by a defined and clarified set \nof  legal  responsibilities  and  liability6.  Such  list  should  not  be  prescriptive  but  rather \nwelcome new business models and include evolving obligations.   ","3314":"5 Sotiris Papasavvas v O Fileleftheros Dimosia Etaireia Ltd and Others, CJEU (Case C-291\/13): \u201cConsequently, \nsince  a  newspaper  publishing  company  which  posts  an  online  version  of  a  newspaper  on  its  website  has,  in \nprinciple, knowledge about the information which it posts and exercises control over that information, it cannot be \nconsidered to be an \u2018intermediary service provider\u2019 within the  meaning of Articles 12 to 14 of Directive 2000\/31, \nwhether or not access to that website is free of charge.\u201d para [45] \n6 Schibsted (2019) Report \u201cEnsuring democracy and freedom of speech online \u2013 a need for a balanced regulation \nof social networks\u201d (link)  ","3315":" \n \n \n \n \n\fIn any event, it is important that the appropriate online intermediary regime should be \na  reinforced  by  a  clear  principle  of  secondary  liability.  Under  the  ECD,  online \nintermediaries are subject to a secondary (or limited) liability for the content they do \nnot own. This is a good principle. Yet the current regime does not encourage online \nintermediaries to take action against  certain types of  illegal content and experience \nshows that self-regulation so far continues to fall short of expectations. Therefore, we \nsuggest  the  DSA  introduces  enhanced  secondary  liability  attached  to  some  duty  of \ncare obligations for major platforms.  ","3316":"In our view, it is important that the DSA becomes an instrument to promote responsible \nactors in the online space. As mentioned, while we agree with the basic principles of \nthe eCommerce Directive, what is missing is the notion of due diligence or duty of care. \nIn our view, platforms should take reasonable steps to keep users safe and prevent \nharming  other  users  as  a  direct  consequence  of  the  activity  performed  on  their \nservices.  Now,  some  online  platforms  often  hide  behind  \u201cthe  responsibility  of  their \nusers\u201d  instead  of  owning  up  to  their  own  accountability.  This  status  quo  cannot  be \ntolerated for major platforms who could be doing much more. ","3317":"In theory whether a platform is big or not, the problems and accountability remain the \nsame. But a differentiation based on a threshold system could be put in place  (e.g. \nbased on income or number of users) or using existing instruments under competition \nlaw (e.g. market dominance). For instance, such duty of care could apply to \u201csystemic\u201d \nplatforms  that  have  become  so  influential  on  all  aspects  of  life  and  the  economy, \nincluding culture, creativity, politics, social life and electronic commerce, that they must \ncarry  a  special  responsibility  towards  society.  We  further  develop  this  notion  in  the \n\u201cgatekeeper power\u201d section.  ","3318":"Hosting platforms that are found \u201csystemic\u201d in nature should only benefit from the safe \nharbour rules applicable under Article 14 ECD provided that they meet clear duty of \ncare  obligations.  This  means  that  large  platforms  that  are  fundamental  to  the \narchitecture of the internet should be bound by special obligations to avoid turning a \nblind  eye  on  illegal  activities  occurring  on  their  services.  For  instance,  business-to-\nbusiness  intermediaries  could  be  subject  to  a  \u201cknow-your-business-customer\u201d  duty \nrequiring identity checks on the basis of official documents (e.g. corporate registration, \npostal  address,  identity  card,  etc)  to  prevent  fake  accounts  or  pirate  websites  from \nprospering. Also, UGC platforms, web browsers, search engines or aggregators, could \nbe  bound  by  a  \u201cshare-with-care\u201d  obligation,  by  warning  users  to  think  twice  before \nsharing or redirecting users to lawful options. External auditing could serve to verify \nwhether such duties have been diligently carried out.  ","3319":" \n \n\fan  indicator  that  the  platform  has  knowledge  over  the  substance  of  the  content  to \ndetermine liability. Systemic platforms would only benefit from the secondary liability \nexemptions provided that they perform special duty of care obligations. Such duty of \ncare  obligations  should in  no  circumstance  apply  to  news  publishers  which already \nfollow thorough editorial processes and assume  clearly defined legal responsibilities \nfor the nature of their content. As such, intermediaries should also not interfere with \neditorial content integrity and media independence by exercising duty of care or other \nstandards in relation to professional news content. Otherwise, online intermediaries\u2019 \nnew  compliance  practices  and  algorithms  risk  delisting,  deranking  or  removing \npublishers\u2019 content. ","3320":"The DSA is the opportunity to clarify the rules applicable to online intermediaries in the \nfight  against  disinformation.  However,  such  rules  must  respect  media  freedom  and \nfundamental rights such as access to information and freedom of expression. Hence, \nwe believe that the DSA should not regulate content but rather encourage platforms to  \nput measures in place to promote trustful sources, become more accountable to the \npublic,  work  with  independent  fact  checkers,  and  demonetise  disinformation  by \nremoving their ability to profit from advertising. Currently, platforms are not sufficiently \nincentivised to put such measures in place.  ","3321":"For instance, there can be a significant financial incentive to fabricate and disseminate \nfake  news,  as  content  published  online  can  benefit  from  advertising  revenue. \nProducers of fake news notably compete with trusted media providers for the attention \nof readers and for advertising revenues.  Therefore, professional journalistic content \nand trusted sources could be put more in the spotlight to give users better access to \nreliable information.  ","3322":"We  suggest  the  DSA  imposes  algorithmic  transparency  rules  on  hosting  service \nproviders to ensure the distribution of a diversity of opinions and variety of contents \nonline. In particular, hosting service providers should be subject to accountability rules \ntowards  news  producers  with  regards  to  the  monetization  and  distribution  of  their \ncontent.  A  functioning  Digital  Single  Market  should  ensure  that  quality  content, \nespecially professional journalism, is given more prominence and attracts more user \ntraffic than illegal or harmful content.  ","3323":"Fact-checking UGC can be a solution in the fight against disinformation while avoiding \nover-removal. However, it is important to preserve the integrity of professional news \nmedia  content  that  has  already  been  fact-checked  and  subject  to  strict  journalistic \nguidelines. In other words, responsibility should never extend to the review of editorial \ncontent  to  respect  media  independence  and  freedom.  Nor  should  platforms\u2019  own \nstandards result in the removal or otherwise undermining of the integrity of journalistic ","3324":"Also,  the  decision  as  to  whether  content  is  \u201cacceptable\u201d  should  not  be  left  to  tech \ncompanies\u2019 private policies or community standards. One issue is that disinformation \nmay be subject to different definitions from one Member State to another and such \nfragmentation can lead to legal uncertainty. In our view, EU guidance could clarify what \ncan  constitute  \u201cdisinformation\u201d,  e.g.  the  notion  of  \u201cintention\u201d  to  differentiate  an \ninaccurate  statement  from  conscious  misinformation,  the  exclusion  of  parody  and \nsatire to preserve media freedom, or generally the exclusion of any definition that could \nbe used as a justification for legal restraints on news media publishers\u2019 content, which \nis already subject to national laws and the industry\u2019s own codes of conduct. ","3325":"That said, decisions related to UGC should be taken in line with cultural differences \nand  national  rules  for  freedom  of  speech.  Therefore,  regulatory  scrutiny  and \nenforcement on disinformation should for now be left to national authorities. However, \nif self-regulatory efforts continue to fall short of expectations, the natural way forward \nwould be additional intervention possibly in the form of co-regulation. Yet there remains \na question mark as to whether this would be best achieved at EU or national level. In \nany event, improved coordination between Member States would yield better results.  ","3326":"In practice, the size of companies involved in the production and distribution of news \nand the ways in which news consumption is evolving means that publishers very often \nhave to work with large online platforms who, by virtue of market structures, have both \nthe  ability  and  incentive  to  engage  in  anti-competitive  practices  that  distort \ncompetition7.  ","3327":"This  observation  relates  mainly  but  not  exclusively  to  large  and  powerful  platform \noperators  that  have  become  \u201csystemic\u201d  digital  gatekeepers,  who  are  unavoidable \npartners and control access to key markets. Such gatekeepers are able to determine \nthe trading conditions for third parties, and to behave independently of other actors in \nthe  online  marketplace  due  to  the  market  power  afforded  to  them  by  their  strategic \nposition as intermediaries.   ","3328":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAs such, large platforms can control access to audiences, monetisation tools, data and \nmore.  Such  platforms  are  present  across a  range  of  markets  of  key  importance  for \nnews  companies,  including  search,  social  networks,  app  stores,  over-the-top \ncommunications services, and content aggregators, which enables them to leverage \ntheir market power into neighbouring markets to the detriment of existing and potential \ncompetitors, including news publishers at large.  ","3329":"EU  competition  law  is  inherently  flexible  enough  to  address  many  of  the  concerns \nshared by the news media. Yet, it is also by itself insufficient to solve all of the problems \nidentified, and complementary regulation is therefore required in the form of ex-ante \nregulation89. Below, we explore a number of recurrent areas of concern identified by \nour industry over the past years, and also provide some case studies, which we believe \nshould inform EU policy makers, across a non-exhaustive range of issues including: ","3330":"Digital gatekeepers are of particular concern to news publishers when they build their \nactivities on a strategic market position. This is because such strategic positions in the \nmarket  may  not  always  satisfy  the  conditions  for  dominance  that  has  traditionally \nguided work in the field of EU competition law. In such cases, competition authorities \nhave very limited powers to prevent market conduct that can still result in significant \nharm for the marketplace and consumers.  ","3331":"It  is  furthermore  important  that  the  role  of  certain  large  platforms  be  recognised  as \n\u201csystemic\u201d  in  their  role  across  a  variety  of  regulatory  purposes,  as  the  European \nCommission acknowledged in its Communication on Shaping Europe\u2019s Digital Future, \nand  regulators  should  not  shy  away  from  understating  this  reality10.  Such  systemic \nplatforms  essentially  control  access  to  large  markets  that  can  hardly  be  ignored  by \nsmaller third-party operators, creating an uneven relationship of dependency, and can \nalso have significant broader social, political and cultural implications for society.  ","3332":"In  a  stricter  economic  sense,  systemic  platforms  constitute  unavoidable  partners, \nwhich  is  the  experience  that  news  publishers  have  in  relation  to  several  of  the  big \ntechnology firms such as Google, Facebook and Apple. As such, they can and should \nin  our  view  also  be  seen  as  systemic  gatekeepers.  The  economic  model  of  these \nplatform operators means that much of the content on the internet is now accessed via \ntheir  platforms,  including  news  and  journalistic  content,  and  it  is  clear  that  a  major \nrelationship of dependency has developed over time.  ","3333":"The  problem  of  excessive  dependency  has  now  reached  a  critical  juncture  that  is \nexacerbated  by  the  economic  models  of  certain  intermediation  platforms  which \ncontinue to leverage their strategic position in the market to forcibly disintermediate \nother industries. In practice, certain systemic gatekeepers are now largely able to set \nthe terms and conditions that govern the distribution and accessing of news content \nvia  their  platforms  independently  of  what  other  third-party  commercial  partners  do, \ndemonstrating their ability to behave independently of other market participants and \ncompetitors.  ","3334":"This dynamic is particularly acute and most visible when it comes to access to data-\nrelated issues, with the prevailing concern of news publishers being the phenomenon \nof  data  disintermediation.  Both  Google  and  Facebook  are  able  to  strong  arm  news \npublishers through their respective publishing tools, Google Accelerated Mobile Pages \n\u201cAMP\u201d and Facebook Instant Articles into giving up any rights on user data or on the \ndata that results from their own commercial activities to the benefit of the closed data \necosystems or walled-gardens that these digital gatekeepers are able to thus reinforce.  ","3335":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThis  puts  news  publishers  in  a  difficult  position  in  relation  to  systemic  gatekeepers \nsince publishers cannot afford to forego the benefits of having access to the market \nand user base that these platform operators can provide access to, in order to retain \nan economically sound footing in the marketplace. News publishers are in this sense \ncoerced to accept unenviable trading conditions and are as such locked in the closed \nplatform ecosystems that systemic gatekeepers develop, alongside their userbase and \ncorresponding data space.  ","3336":"Looking to the not so distant future, the rise of smart speakers, voice assistants and \nsimilar  audio-based  technologies,  raise  significant  concerns  about  a  handful  of \ncompanies  becoming  gatekeepers  at  the  centre  of  much  regulatory  debate.  Such \ninternet-of-things devices are likely to rapidly grow to control access to key markets \nand become unavoidable partners, and the way in which the underlying search function \nof such devices respond to queries will have a major impact on the media sector11.  ","3337":"Overall, it is clear to us that there are several ways in which gatekeepers can be looked \nat and defined. Most importantly for the news industry, is the recognition that certain \nlarge  platforms  in  particular  take  on  a  systemic  character  in  their  importance  as \ncommercial partners, and as such become \u201cunavoidable partners\u201d. They are effectively \ngatekeepers to users, data, and entire markets.  ","3338":"The  notion  of  gatekeepers  is  not  a  notion  that  should  be  restricted  by  existing  EU \ncompetition  law  constructs,  and  should  instead  be  flexible  to  address  the  current \nshortcoming  of  the  competition  framework.  The  importance  of  specific  criteria  in \ndetermining  which  platforms  should  qualify  as  \u201cgatekeepers\u201d,  and  consequently  be \nincluded in the scope of a stronger, ex-ante framework for large platforms, should be \nfurther investigated in the framework of an impact assessment study.  ","3339":"However, when the market power of intermediaries or their strategic market position is \nused to forcibly impose or exacerbate disintermediation effects at the expense of the \nlegitimate  activities  of  third-party  businesses,  with  the  effect  of  coercing  such \nbusinesses  into  accepting  otherwise  unacceptable  terms  and  conditions,  such \nintermediaries raise strong concerns about harmful anti-competitive behaviour.  ","3340":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDisintermediation  can  take  many  forms  and  gatekeeping  platforms  such  as  Google \nand  Facebook  have  been  central  to  the  harmful  disintermediation  process  that  has \ntaken place between news publishers and their audiences over the past 20 years. This \ndevelopment  is  highly  regrettable  since  intermediation  by  online  platforms  is  not \ninherently harmful and could in theory be harnessed to drive healthy competition in \ndigital markets.  ","3341":"Platforms such as Google and Facebook go to great lengths to control the interfaces \nthrough  which  news  content  is  delivered  on  their  platforms  and  to  claim  exclusive \nownership  of  users  and  client  relationships.  They  also  further  disintermediate  the \nadvertising  side  of  the  market  as  well  as  audiences,  and  by  extension  they  also \ndisintermediate publishers from data that is critical to the development of sustainable \ndigital business models.  ","3342":"Disintermediation problems related to data are particularly urgent to address since data \nserves  not  only  as  input  for  key  business  processes,  but  for  innovation,  for  the \ndevelopment of new products and services, and for spotting emerging market trends. \nOn a broader level, data allows businesses to better engage with their consumers and \naudiences and enables digital business models to thrive. This is particularly relevant \nwhen considering the need to attract paying customers in the form of subscribers. In \npractice, publishers need to be able to access data if they are to be able to offer good \nservices and to compete with large platforms.  ","3343":"News  publishers  may  try  to  bypass  the  data  ecosystems  of  large  platforms  and  to \ndevelop their own capabilities as competitors, by creating first party data spaces which \ncan  have  multiple purposes.  When  that  is  possible,  more  publishing,  analytical and \ntrading functions can be brought in house and allow for companies to further develop \nand diversify their business models and strategic capabilities through organic growth. ","3344":"This approach, however, can only succeed if  digital platforms do not interfere with the \nability  of  publishers  to  collect  and  process  data  associated  with  their  products  and \naudiences,  and  if  they  do  not  artificially  restrict  the  right  of  legitimate  businesses \noperating on their platforms to collect and process that data. This problem posed by \ndata disintermediation can be illustrated through several industry products belonging \nto Google, Apple and Facebook, amongst others.  ","3345":"In the case of Apple\u2019s App Store, for example, Apple claims to have ownership of the \nrelationship  with  users  of  apps  developed  by  third  party  developers  that  are  made \navailable on its App Store platform. Whereas many news publishers spend significant \namounts of time and effort to develop apps to better engage with audiences, and in a ","3346":"Apple considers that it owns the said data because the terms and conditions governing \nthe use of the App Store for app developers stipulate that Apple is the contractual party \nwith whom end-users of apps enter into an agreement. The Commission\u2019s decision to \nopen  a  formal  probe  into  the  App  Store  and  the  number  of  complaints  concerning \nApple\u2019s policy is testament to the seriousness of the concerns raised over time by such \npractices.  ","3347":"It needs to be assessed whether the imposition of terms by platforms such as Apple \nthat systematically disintermediate data and\/or seek to limit access to data, constitute \nan abuse of dominance, and it is equally necessary to assess whether such terms can \nbe  considered  unfair  and anti-competitive  in  light  of  this.  Yet  such  issues  may also \narise in situations where a given platform may not be dominant per se in a strict sense, \nbut instead may still be regarded as a digital gatekeeper with important \u201cintermediary \npower\u201d.  ","3348":"On the other hand, if one follows the logic of the 2018 Android decision13, it could be \nargued that Apple faces no competition in app stores for Apple\u2019s iOS, and that Apple \nis therefore the default monopolist in this market and thus holds a dominant position, \nand  that  its  App  Store  rules  are  therefore  capable  of  producing  exclusionary  and \nexploitative effects on app developers at large.  ","3349":"The  case  goes  to  demonstrate  how  a  finding  of  dominance,  which  could  have  a \ndecisive  impact  on  the  finding  of  whether  certain  practices  are  abusive,  anti-\ncompetitive and harmful under the current regulatory framework, can vary in outcome \nas  a  function  of  the  market  definition  process.  Regardless  of  the  outcome  of  this \nparticular case, it follows that it is conceivable that more situations may arise whereby \na firm may not be necessarily dominant because of the definition of the relevant market \nbut  could  still  be  engaged  in  practices  with  harmful  effects  on  the  market  and \nconsumers that warrant some form of intervention.  ","3350":"This effectively amounts to harmful form of data disintermediation which will keep users \nin  the  Apple  closed  data  ecosystem  to  the  detriment  of  publishers  who  will \nconsequently loose access to valuable data. In this scenario, Apple is leveraging its \nposition  as  a  gatekeeper,  without  necessarily  doing  so  on  the  basis  of  a  dominant \nmarket position. ","3351":"App stores, in general, also raise a broader question going forward about who should \nbe considered the owner of data, and by extension who should have the legitimate \nright to access data held by intermediaries. In many cases, such data is essential so \nthat the right level of service can be provided to users and so that businesses may \ndevelop their own capabilities and digital business models. Cutting off third parties from \naccessing such data therefore does not seem fair or legitimate.  ","3352":"In  fact,  it  appears  counterintuitive  that  intermediary  platforms  rather  than  app \ndevelopers should own and control access to such key data. When a user navigates \nthe app of a news publisher and benefits from journalistic content on it, it is clear the \nuser is doing so primarily in a capacity as a consumer of a product or service supplied \nby the app developer. In that case, the fact the content is accessed via, for example, \neither an app store belonging to Apple or Google, is merely coincidental.  ","3353":"We therefore believe that the DSA should impose a legitimate data access obligation \non platforms acting as gatekeepers towards third-party commercial partners operating \non their platform. This would go a long way towards balancing competition in the long-\nterm, in ways that competition policy cannot address, especially when non-dominant \nfirms are concerned, and give recognition to legitimate online business models. Such \nan obligation should explicitly include app stores in its scope.  ","3354":"There is no comprehensive and definitive study identifying across markets the typical \nor average split and distribution of revenues. But the existing literature and anecdotal \nevidence,  probably  more  on  the  optimistic  side  of  the  discussion,  point  to  news \npublishers  struggling  in  most  cases  to  achieve  even  half  every  1  EUR  spent  by \nadvertisers at the other end of the supply chain. This is often referred to as the so-\ncalled \u201cad tech tax\u201d that ultimately remains difficult to explain and which we elaborate \non in the following section.  ","3355":"Overall,  it  is  concerning  to  observe  the  continued  trend  and  paradox  of  increased \npopularity and monetisation of digital media content, in particular as regards journalistic \ncontent, while the financial gains derived from that very content, or the proportion of \nthose profits that goes back to benefit content producers, remains very limited. In this \nsense,  the  main  beneficiaries  of  content  monetisation  through  advertising  are  now \nlarge and powerful online platforms which intermediate, distribute and monetise third-\nparty content.  ","3356":"It is of particular concern for the news industry that certain platforms not only distribute \nnews content, but also compete for advertising revenue with news organisations while \nsupplying  them  with  advertising  technology-related  services.  This  can  contribute  to \nexacerbating the gatekeeper relationship between large platforms and news publishers \nand in this sense, large platforms may have become unavoidable partners to an even \ngreater extent which enables them to impose unenviable terms and conditions. ","3357":"In addition, we note that several platforms increasingly compete with news publishers \nfor the provision of news-related products and services, as evidenced by the growing \nnumber  of  journalists  that  these  platforms  are  hiring  to  support  their  product \ndevelopment  teams.  This  is  a  testament  to  their  intent  to  move  into  news-related \nneighbouring markets, in a bid to extract further value from publishers, possibly through \ngreater disintermediation.  ","3358":"Another  issue  that  deserves  particular  importance  from  the  perspective  of  online \nadvertising, is the shift that internet browsers are forcing through the phasing out of \nthird-party  cookies,  which  are  fundamentally  essential  to  the  ways  in  which  digital \nadvertising  companies  currently  operate,  except  for  Google  who  is  largely  able  to \nprovide advertising services on a first-party basis due to the vast swathes of data it has \naccumulated over time through its many products and services. ","3359":"This  is  why  the  announced  phasing  out  of  third-party  cookies  by  Google by  202216 \nthrough  the  Google  Chrome  internet  browser  raises  strong  concerns  about  the \nexclusionary effects it would have on the rest of the online advertising industry. This is \nof  particular  concern  when  one  considers  that  Google  already  holds  a  dominant \nposition both in the market for web browsers and the online advertising market, which \ncould as a result become further entrenched.  ","3360":"Google has justified its decision to phase out third-party cookies as informed by privacy \nconcerns, following similar moves by Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and Apple\u2019s Safari browsers. \nYet, it seems that eliminating third-party cookies only, if anything, maintains the ability \nof  companies  such  as  Google  and  Facebook  to  track  users,  while  preventing  their \ncompetitors  in  the  advertising  sector  from  doing  the  same,  thus  strengthening  their \nposition as gatekeepers. In practice, it will become harder for other digital advertising \ncompanies  to  conduct  their  activities  such  as  browser-based  targeting,  cross-site \ntracking,  frequency  capping  and  retargeting,  which  are  essential  parameters  of \ncompetition.  ","3361":"Indeed, the move would also not affect the quantity and depth of tracking that Google \nitself  would  continue  to  conduct,  and  therefore  raises  important  questions  about \nwhether  this  decision  is  really  motivated  by  privacy  concerns,  or  by  abusive  anti-\ncompetitive  behaviour  with  clear  exclusionary  effects  on  competitors,  since  unlike \nMozilla and Apple, Google has a clearly dominant position and important market power \nin browsers that it can leverage in the online advertising market.  ","3362":"Transparency in the marketplace is a basic requisite for the development of a healthy \ncompetitive environment. Unfortunately, transparency is too often lacking the case in \nthe ad-tech ecosystem and it is clear to us that much more can be done to improve \ntransparency  to  the  benefit  of  all  participants  involved,  businesses  and  consumers \nalike17.  ","3363":"Indeed, Google has been able to exploit the GDPR to its own advantage to entrench \nits market position by offering to deliver all advertising technology services in the ad \ntech  stack  while  also  refusing  to  share  data  with  publishers,  preventing  them  from \neffectively competing and developing their own capabilities. In doing so, it has also \nbecome  clear  that  the  data  protection  standards  applied  by  Google  for  internal \npurposes,  as  opposed  to  in  relation  to  data  sharing  with  third  parties,  are  by \ncomparison less restrictive. ","3364":"A  recent  study  by  PwC  UK  suggests  that  15%  of  every  British  Pound  spent  by \nadvertisers \u201cdisappear\u201d in the supply chain and cannot be accounted for, a situation \nwhich in our understanding reflects the market reality in other parts of Europe as well18. \nIt follows that there are legitimate questions and concerns about the way in which parts \nof the ad tech ecosystem work. ","3365":"Shedding  light  on  the  competitive  process  is  complicated  because  of  the  difficulty \ninvolved in gathering the information necessary to make a good assessment of the \nlandscape. It is notoriously difficult to map out the precise scope of activity of firms \ninvolved in online advertising intermediation at technical level alongside market shares, \nand how such parameters may reflect different competitive processes.  ","3366":"Yet, this  would remain insufficient to address the current concerns shared by news \npublishers and other parts of the advertising ecosystem. When discussing the lack of \ntransparency  in  ad-tech,  it  is  also  important  to  discuss  the  role  of  the  Google \nadvertising machinery specifically, since it plays such an important role throughout the \nentire supply chain from picking the relevant ads, to placing them and measuring their \neffectiveness on publishers\u2019 websites.  ","3367":"As the European Commission recently noted as part the Google-Fitbit merger review \nprocedure19, Google is already dominant in online search advertising, it holds a strong \nmarket position in online display advertising and, importantly for this discussion, it also \nholds a strong market position in the supply of ad tech services.  ","3368":"Because  Google\u2019s  market  power  across  these  key  online  advertising  markets  is  so \nstrong,  it  is  equally  concerning  to  observe  the  absence  of  full  transparency  and \ndisclosure on how it determines its commercial offerings and how they may artificially \ndeflate  the  bottom  line  of  commercial  partners  through  higher  prices  that  harm \nbusiness users and consumers.  ","3369":"It  is  commonplace  for  industry  commentators  to  refer  to  the  Google  advertising \necosystem as a \u201cblack box\u201d20, where advertisers do not know why they are paying a \ncertain price to put out their ads and do not know whether they are getting the best \nvalue for their money, and vice versa when it comes to online publishers.  ","3370":"Central to this concern is the realisation that Google operates with conflicts of interest \nas it is significantly active both on the sell and buy-side of the advertising market, with \na strong position at each stage of the value chain21. On the basis of its uniquely strong \nmarket  power  in  advertising,  Google  is  able  to  charge  significantly  higher  prices  to \nadvertisers than its competitors.  ","3371":"In this sense, Google has the ability and incentive to exploit its position on both sides \nof the market by engaging in exclusionary conduct through self-preferencing. In doing \nso, Google is able to leverage its strong position to make it harder for third parties to \ncompete  on  the  merits.  Google\u2019s  significant  data  advantage  and  the  absence  of \nmeaningful competition in search advertising, from where Google leveraged its strong \nmarket position to enter the open display market, only aggravate this concern.  ","3372":"19 European Commission (2020) Press Release \u201cMergers: Commission opens in-depth investigation into the \nproposed acquisition of Fitbit by Google\u201d (link)  \n20 New York Times (2019) The Online Ad World Is Murky. A Group of Companies Wants to Fix That. (link) \n21 Competition and Markets Authority (2020) Online platforms and digital advertising report (link) ","3373":"At its very core, Google\u2019s online advertising business is about the real-time electronic \nbuying and selling of ads and advertising space through an advertising exchange. In \nessence, this business replicates the structure of traded financial markets, except that \nin Google\u2019s case, it is a single company that simultaneously operates the leading trade \nvenue and the leading buyers and sellers. Google therefore engages in market conduct \nthat would in other electronic trading markets be prohibited by law22. The status quo \namounts to having leading banks running the most important stock exchanges. ","3374":"It  is  therefore  also  essential,  in  addition  to  developing  more  transparent  billing  and \nreceipting,  to  further  investigate  the  online  advertising  value  chain  and  Google\u2019s \nmultiple roles thereof to determine if it is abusing its position as dominant firm and a \nsystemic gatekeeper, and whether some form of structural separation or prohibition to \nbe active on both the buy and sell sides of the market is consequently necessary to \nensure the good functioning of the market.  ","3375":"Typically, this is reflected in the unilateral imposition of terms and conditions that third \nparties are coerced into accepting due to the gatekeeping role of platforms on which \nthey rely and depend on to do business. A subsequent issue is that such terms and \nconditions  are  not  always  contestable  since  they  may  not  necessarily  constitute  an \nanti-competitive practice with harmful effects within the meaning of EU competition law.  ","3376":"For example, these gatekeepers can make sudden and unexplained changes to their \nbasic search (or similar) algorithms, which can have an important, adverse impact on \nthe  web  traffic  of  news  publishers  and  on  their  financial  performance  and  ability  to \ndevelop their data capabilities in the longer-term. Repeated efforts to address this issue \ndirectly with these companies have yielded little to no attention at all to this ongoing \nproblem. In this area, it is clear that additional rules of conduct of business rules are \nneeded  to  ensure  more  predictability  for  businesses  subject  to  rankings  and  other \nforms  of  indexation.  In  this  respect,  the  rules  in  Art.  5  of  the  Platform-to-Business \nRegulation (EU) 2019\/1150 on rankings under are necessary but not sufficient.  ","3377":"For  news  publishers,  the  AMP  standard  is  concerning  because  refusing  to  use  it \nbasically results in lower rankings in search and exclusion from news carousels found \nin the Google News and Google Discover products. As such, it amounts to exclusionary \nconduct. Furthermore, the AMP format also means that content is hosted and served \ndirectly via Google\u2019s own proprietary servers and domains which means that users are \nkept within the Google ecosystem or walled-garden which reinforces its own market \nposition.  ","3378":"Concerns broadly similar to Google\u2019s AMP exist in respect of Facebook\u2019s sister product \n\u201cInstant Articles\u201d. With the development of a Facebook \u201cNews Tab\u201d product, and its \nexpected roll out in Europe this year or next, there are growing concerns that Facebook \nmay  coerce  publishers  into  adopting  the  content  delivery  format  standard  by \ndeveloping  search  rankings  that  penalise  publishers  that  do  not  make  use  of  it, \nresulting in exclusionary conduct similar to Google with AMP and the Google News \nand Google Discovery products.  ","3379":"As in the case of changing algorithms, both Google and Facebook have shown very \nlittle interest in sitting at the table with news publishers to discuss concerns associated \nwith the AMP and IA products, which illustrates the problem of bargaining power that \npublishers face. For large gatekeeping platforms like Google and Facebook, it does \nnot matter if a few publishers refuse or reject their products and terms and conditions \nat an important cost whereas the opposite is true for publishers who are dependent on \nfair access to those markets to develop a strong and sustainable digital presence.  ","3380":"A more recent illustration of this same problem can be observed in the ongoing dispute \ninvolving Google and French news publishers in relation to the implementation of the \nCopyright Directive (EU) 2019\/790, which affords news publishers a new neighbouring \nright which entitles them to remuneration for the exploitation of their content.  ","3381":"This dispute, which we expected will be replicated in other Member States and beyond \nglobally,  as  evidenced  by  recent  developments  in  Australia27,  demonstrates  the \nproblematic nature of Google\u2019s bargaining power in relation to news publishers, raising \nimportant concerns from the perspective of competition law and provisions against the \nabuse of dominant positions.  ","3382":"Google is currently able to leverage is market power and far superior bargaining power \nto prevent the application of Article 15 of the new Copyright Directive (EU) 2019\/790. \nThe French competition authority found in its preliminary decision28 that Google has \npotentially  abused  its  dominant  position  in  the  search  market  by  offering  news ","3383":"Last but not least, the terms and conditions governing the use of Apple\u2019s App Store \ncan also be used as example of imbalance in bargaining power. In essence, it is equally \ndifficult  for  news  publishers  to  forego  a  presence  on  the  Apple  ecosystem  and \npublishers are therefore forced to accept whatever terms and conditions Apple wishes \nto impose, even when this may amount to exploitative abuse.  ","3384":"Currently, publishers who develop their own apps face important restrictions on what \nthey  may  communicate  to  their  users  through  their  apps,  and  the  required  use  of \nApple\u2019s proprietary in-app purchase system to sell content, which in turn is tied to a \nsignificant fee, and consequently eliminates competition in payments. Unfortunately, \nApple  has  shown  no  interest  in  discussing  those  terms  and  conditions  in  the  past, \nwhich also points towards bargaining power problems.  ","3385":"Regarding  the  specific  issue  of  payments,  we  believe  that  additional  regulation  is \nneeded to ensure open competition. This issue is not new, and EU legislation is already \nin  place  to  ensure  competition  in  payments  when  it  comes  to  banking  institutions \nthrough the second Payment Services Directive (EU) 2015\/2366. We support similar \nlegislation to avoid exploitative abuses.  ","3386":"The bargaining power issues identified demonstrate that a stronger form of regulatory \nincentive is needed to ensure more balance in the way in which platforms interact with \nnews publishers. In our view, the introduction of an ex-ante framework with horizontal \nrules for large platforms, inter alia on self-preferencing and other forms of exclusionary \nand exploitative practices, must be an important element of the regulatory response.  ","3387":"Broader  concerns  over  imbalances  in  bargaining  power,  specifically  in  relation  to \nmedia  players  and  news  publishers  in  particular,  are  not  new.  Indeed,  there  have \nalready been debates about whether the industry should be granted a waiver from anti-\ntrust laws in order to engage in collective bargaining with systemic gatekeepers such \nas Google and Facebook. The idea is that such bargaining rights could cover different \nactivities,  such  as  terms  and  conditions  of  content  distribution,  and  content \nmonetisation via licensing and advertising.  ","3388":"Closer to home in Europe, the German legislator adopted a law in the form of the 9th \nAmendment Bill to the Act Against Restraints of Competition which entered into force \nin June 201731. The amendments included inter alia an exemption from cartel rules for \ncertain forms of cooperation between publishers of newspapers.  ","3389":"More recently, the UK competition authority as part of its \u201cOnline platforms and digital \nadvertising\u201d market study recommended the establishment of a pro-competitive digital \nregulatory regime, including the development of a code of conduct that would inter alia \ncover elements of the publisher-platform relationship, with issues such as control over \ncontent, content monetisation and access to user data being addressed32.  ","3390":"Our view at EU level is that it is clear that further tools, possibly along the lines of some \nof  those  described  above,  are  needed  to  address  the  current  acute  imbalance  in \nbargaining power between news publishers and systemic digital gatekeepers, possibly \nbuilding further on the Platform-to-Business Regulation (EU) 2019\/1150 instrument.  ","3391":"The previous sections identified and described some of the key competition problems \nfaced by news media when doing business in the digital economy. Even if some of \nthose challenges are specific to the media sector and news publishers, it is also clear \nthat many are not insofar as they also concern other businesses operating in digital \nmarkets in their capacity as business users of, or third parties to, large online platforms.  ","3392":"The competition problems faced by news media warrant in our view the introduction of \nboth ex-ante rules for digital gatekeepers and of a complementary new competition \ntool to preserve and restore dynamic competition in digital markets. In particular, the \nintroduction  of  ex-ante  rules  for platforms  is  also  in  itself  unlikely  to  be  sufficient  to \naddress emerging competition concerns associated with digital markets given the pace \nat which such markets evolve. As such, the introduction of a new competition tool as a \ncomplementary instrument to ex-ante regulation becomes critically important to ensure \na healthy competitive process. ","3393":"In  this  sense,  we  believe  that  the  proposed  new  competition  tool  could  bring  most \nadded  value  to  the  EU  competition  framework  as  a  horizontal,  market-based \ninstrument  because  it  could  accordingly  provide  a  clear  basis  for  market-wide \ninterventions  to  proactively  promote  competition,  not  only  on  the  basis  of  market \nconduct  but  also  of  market  features.  Such  a  change  in  the  underlying  approach  to \nenforcement would in our view constitute positive and progressive change, but also at \na more practical level address some of the substantive gaps or limitations associated \nwith ex-ante regulation.  ","3394":"Some  digital  markets  exhibit  important  structural  risks  for  competition,  while  others \nexperience a structural lack of competition. The latter in particular may arise notably \nbut  not  exclusively  when  the  concerned  market  is  tipping  or  has  already  tipped,  or \nwhen certain firms become insulated from dynamic competition because their strong \nmarket  position  becomes  so  entrenched  that  the  market  is  no  longer  properly \ncontestable. It is by now abundantly clear that digital market failures are more prevalent \nthan  some  commentators  would  suggest,  especially  in  light  of  repeated  claims  not \nsupported by little to no evidence that digital markets experience intensive competition \nand that markets remain highly contestable. ","3395":"It  is  clear  that  many  market  features  can  play  an  important  role  in  producing  such \nstructural outcomes and they include but are not limited to market concentration, high \nvertical  integration  (and  ensuing  conflicts  of  interest),  lack  of  multi-homing,  lack  of \naccess  to  data,  extreme  economies  of  scale  and  scope,  strong  direct  and  indirect \nnetwork effects, the gatekeeping role of some platforms and broader relationships of \neconomic dependency, the development of platforms ecosystems or walled-gardens, \nand  general  lack  of  transparency.  When  combined,  these  dynamics  favour  the \ncontinued  incumbency  of  large platforms  and  raise  questions  as  to  whether  certain \nmarkets are even still contestable.  ","3396":"At  a  more  granular  level,  it  is  of  particular  concern  that  large  platforms  are  able  to \nleverage their market power, or strategic market position in the case of gatekeepers, \nfrom one market to another, or multiple others, in ways that are not possible for other \nmarket operators to replicate and that are inconsistent with the principle of competition \non the merits. As such, it is important that the current regulatory toolbox is strengthened \nwhen it comes to platforms that are largely insulated from dynamic competition, and \nwho engage in harmful market conduct, especially when the said conduct is identified \nin the absence of a finding of dominance within the meaning of EU competition law and \nArticle 102 TFEU.  ","3397":"This is important because some platforms may in the absence of a dominant status in \na given defined market still play a role of systemic importance in the marketplace, for \ninstance by virtue of their role as gatekeepers, derived from their strategic position in \nthe market as an intermediary. The market conduct of such gatekeepers is as such \nable to produce important exclusionary and exploitative effects to the detriment of other \neconomic operators and consumers alike, that should raise serious concerns about \nharm.  ","3398":"It is therefore essential that the new competition tool does not become a dominance-\nbased instrument. A case in point may be the emerging market smart speakers, voice \nassistants  and  similar  internet-of-things  audio-based  technologies  which  raise \nsignificant concerns about a handful of companies that may become gatekeepers33 in \nan oligopolistic market structure, where no single platform may necessarily achieve a \nmarket dominant status.  ","3399":"The French competition authority put forward earlier this year interesting proposals on \ndigital gatekeepers34, reflecting a progressive understanding of underlying theories of \nharm in digital markets applicable in the case of non-dominant undertakings. In that \ncontext,  a  number  of  harmful  and  abusive  gatekeeper  practices  were  identified  as \nraising  concerns  including  discrimination,  preventing  access  to  markets  where  the \ngatekeeper  is  not  dominant,  leveraging  data  where  the  gatekeeper  is  dominant, \nmaking  interoperability  more  difficult,  making  portability  more  difficult,  and  making \nmultihoming more difficult.  ","3400":"That is especially important given recent experience and difficulties associated with \noverseeing  the  effective  implementation  of  behavioural  remedies  in  digital  markets, \nwhich  we  suspect  will  gradually  lead  to  more  prevalent  use  of  structural  remedies, \nespecially if the aggressive market conduct of certain platforms remains unchanged. \nWe  furthermore  wish  to  highlight  the  importance  of  explicitly  including  data-related \nremedies in the scope of the proposed instrument, including mandated access to data \nfor  third  parties,  mandated  interoperability,  and  mandated  data  separation  or \nprevention from integration.  ","3401":"Overall, it is our understanding that a new competition tool should be an instrument \nsufficiently flexible to address a variety of different competitive scenarios that may arise \nin digital markets. One of the main benefits of a new competition tool should therefore \nbe to promote timely and efficient intervention in such markets before irreparable harm \noccurs, in what may be described as strengthening the preventive arm of competition \npolicy. Keeping up with change in digital markets is already widely recognised as a \nmajor challenge for competition authorities that contributes to the enforcement gap35. \nThe proposed instrument should therefore seek to add value in this area.  ","3402":"Our  submission  identifies  several  situations  where  the  imminent  launch  of  new \nproducts and services by large platforms, or changes to terms and conditions, are the \nsource of competition concerns, and where a new competition tool could be envisaged \nas an instrument capable of swift and proportionate intervention on justified grounds, \nbefore irreparable harm occurs. The market-wide intervention powers are also relevant \nin  such  cases  to  avoid  \u201creinventing  the  wheel\u201d  in  some  scenarios,  such  as  those \ninvolving Google\u2019s harmful market conduct in vertical, specialised search markets. ","3403":"So while it is clear that a number of procedural safeguards should be introduced as \nregards the new competition tool, both as a matter of general good law and to ensure \nthat  the  tool  is  not  misused,  such  safeguards  should  not  be  so  burdensome  as  to \nundermine  timely  intervention  in  the  market  or  to  reproduce  lengthy  procedures \ntraditionally associated with competition cases, or be opened to other abusive \u201cdelay \ntactics\u201d. Any process of judicial review should benefit from a fast track procedure with \ncompetent courts of justice.  ","3404":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIn any event, it remains essential for any new competition tool to have sufficient powers \nto pose a credible challenge to the systemic, anti-competitive market conduct of certain \nlarge online platforms. It is clear that large platforms are able to approach competition \nproceedings  as  a  cost  of  doing  business,  while  conversely  for  other  businesses  in \ndigital markets the questions at stake are more often than not of an existential nature. \nThe new competition tool should therefore act as a deterrent against harmful market \nconduct  and  bring  more  discipline  to  digital  markets,  with  the  understanding  that \ndissuasiveness should remain a cornerstone of EU competition policy.  ","3405":"As concerns the relationship between the proposed new competition tool and other \ncompetition instruments, such as sector inquiries, enforcement through cases and the \nforeseen ex-ante rules, some clarifications would be needed regarding the preferred \napproach according to the circumstances. As previously iterated, we view one of the \nmajor benefits of a new competition tool as the ability to swiftly intervene in markets to \nprevent irreparable damage.  ","3406":"That will however only be possible if the substantive standard of proof to be met for \nimposing necessary and proportionate remedies is lowered, possibly reversed under \nspecific  circumstances,  as  compared  to  current  practice  in  individual  enforcement \ncases. Since the process should be open to judicial review and would not involve the \nformal  finding  of  an  infringement  nor  fines  or  other  penalties,  this  seems  to  be  a \nreasonable compromise approach that could safeguard procedural fairness while also \nensuring the flexibility required to successfully operate the proposed instrument.  ","3407":"Online advertising plays a uniquely important role in funding journalism across Europe, \nat a time of important difficulties for our industry. The digital transformation of news \npublishers in particular continues to be a complicated process as the growth in digital \nrevenues is often insufficient to offset lost revenues from the legacy print business.  ","3408":"There  is  absolutely  no  doubt  that  advertisement  should  be  identifiable  as \nadvertisement, whether that is on paper or in a digital format36. EU legislation already \nensures in several ways that \u201ccommercial communications\u201d should be identifiable as \nsuch,  even  if  the  precise  standards  through  which  this  requirement  is  implemented \ncurrently varies depending on the Member State.  ","3409":"With  such  concerns  borne  in  mind,  the  news  media  industry  continues  to  be  very \nsupportive of self-regulatory initiatives in the field of advertising as means of achieving \ngood  outcomes  that  balance  all  the  interests  at  stake  in  this  debate.  Our  industry \nproactively supports self-regulation as means of achieving more efficient and better \nresults than through lengthy and burdensome regulatory procedures involving public \nauthorities.  ","3410":"We are of the view that if there are concerns associated with the status quo concerning \ntransparency requirements on commercial communications, that this should be raised \nas an issue with self-regulatory bodies in the first place to better understand whether \nlegislation  is  even  needed  or  justified.  We  remain  available  to  further  discuss  the \nongoing work in the field of advertising self-regulation.  ","3411":"The issue of political advertisement has received significant attention in recent years \ndue to various interrelated developments. There have been suggestions that the EU \nshould seek to further regulate such advertising, notably based on the understanding \nthat  what  is  illegal  offline,  should  also  be  illegal  online.  We  therefore  share  some \nobservations below.  ","3412":"It is clear that large online platforms such as those operating as social networks could \ndo much more to ensure that political advertising takes place under sound conditions. \nThis includes but is not limited to transparency for users on why they are seeing certain \nads, verifying the identity of advertisers, and revealing how much political advertisers \nare spending, for instance.  ","3413":"The ad-tech and broader third-party ecosystem that characterises the contemporary \nonline advertising industry is very important to news publishers because it allows news \norganisations  to  efficiently  monetise  their  content  without  necessarily  having  to \npossess  the  relevant  in-house  technological  knowledge  and  expertise.  This  is \nparticularly  useful  for  smaller  and  medium-sized  businesses,  such  as  local  and \nregional publishers.  ","3414":"In practice, the use of advertising technology allows news publishers to drive a better \nmatch between the ads served and the audiences that they reach, meaning that such \nads have a better conversion rate (ie. the desired outcome in terms of either raising \nawareness  or  leading  to  an  actionable  outcome  such  as  the  sale  of  a  product  or \nservice).  For  this  reason,  advertising  space  can  command  a  higher  price  with \nmarketeers, which helps to drive profitability.  ","3415":" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWorking with third parties to form an online advertising supply-chain, however, also \nmeans that news organisations are only partially in control of the supply-chain. This \nloss of control is not inherently harmful but poses a number of challenges in the present \nenvironment in the absence of an appropriate overarching framework that helps ensure \ncollective responsible behaviour and accountability in the marketplace. ","3416":"The current challenges are in particular exacerbated by the presence of tech giants \nwith immense market power who are in position to act unilaterally with no regard for \nother market participants. The strong position and vertical integration of Google along \nthe ad-tech value chain is of major concern here. As such, it is clear to news publishers \nthat much more can be done to improve transparency to the benefit of all participants \ninvolved.  ","3417":"While the overall situation has arguably improved from a data protection point of view \nsince the GDPR came into force in 2018, there are still basic transparency concerns \nthat persist as regards bidding processes and matching functions, pricing, hidden fees, \nand  the  wider  competitive  process.  For  instance,  and  as  already  explained  in  the \nsection concerning gatekeepers, a recent study by PwC UK suggests that 15% of every \nBritish  Pound  spent  by  advertisers  \u201cdisappear\u201d  in  the  supply  chain  and  cannot  be \naccounted for37.  ","3418":"As news publishers seek to develop a trusted and safe digital environment in which to \nserve customers and to develop better products and solutions, they need to ensure \nthat all of their partners act responsibly. It is therefore of the highest importance that \nnews publishers, also being ultimately responsible for the impact that activities may \nhave on direct users of their service, are able to conduct audit assessments of other \nparticipants in the supply-chain, even in the absence of direct contractual relationships \nwith advertising intermediaries.   ","3419":"As  industry  best  practice  and  norms  evolve,  such  auditing  practices  are  becoming \nmore common place and accepted. However, not all market participants, least of which \nlarge online platforms, and in particular Google who maintains an extremely strong and \nvertically integrated presence throughout the online advertising market, are willing to \naccept  to  be  transparently  audited  for  the  purpose  of  ensuring  that  acceptable \nstandards  are  met  in  the  broader  process  of  serving  ads  to  users.  Regulation  may \ntherefore be needed to ensure that the use of audit procedures becomes possible.  ","3420":"The importance of conducting such audits cannot be understated. There are concerns \nassociated  with  competition  law,  consumer  protection,  data  protection,  privacy \nprotection, disinformation, other forms of harmful content, and other illegal or bad ads. \nAll of these possible areas of concern warrant some degree of access to all participants \nin the supply chain to ensure better control by first parties and to safeguard the best \ninterest of legitimate businesses and consumers alike.  ","3421":"We stress that any new regime should be targeted at the platforms, neither placing \nnew or broader legal responsibilities upon publishers, or allowing the platforms to shift \ntheir  responsibilities  to  them,  nor  require  publishers  to  perform  unreasonable  due \ndiligence checks beyond normal contractual requirements, nor be placed at risk of legal \nliability for failure to do so. ","3422":"We  note  that  it  has  been  suggested  that  this  framework  is  insufficient  to  obtain \nmeaningful user consent to the relevant data-driven operations used to deliver ads, \nwhich we strongly disagree with. News publishers provide ample and comprehensive \ninformation to website users and audiences about how online ads are served and make \nuse of user information in the form of personal data.  ","3423":"It  has  also  been  suggested  that  another,  additional  layer  of  consent  specific  to \nadvertising should be introduced. We view such proposals as redundant, unnecessary, \nburdensome, and inconsistent with existing rules. We  further take  the view that the \ncurrent regulatory framework is fit for purpose and should not be undermined in this \nway.  ","3424":"We also wish to note that proposals to introduce so-called \u201caccountability and fairness \ncriteria\u201d  to  algorithms  used  to  target  users  with  advertisement  to  allow  the  use  of \nexternal audits could prove a very demanding and burdensome exercise. We suggest \nthat existing tools in the field of audit are explored before considering any regulatory \nmeasures.

This is because consumers can now compare offers by staying on the SERP and interacting with the Google Shopping One Box without accessing any CSS website.

The Shopping case is an example of how principles can be circumvented in the absence of a prescriptive remedy. It\u2019s clear that anti-trust enforcement is flawed.

This would address the structural issue on the market, allowing CSSs to gain users and to compete to provide the most useful service to those users. Doing so would also allow them to contract with new merchants (who would be attracted by those users), promoting an innovative growth cycle and renewed competition in the CSS market.","3435":"We believe that regulation and remedies must be enshrined in legislation.

Since the former displays less offers than a traditional CSS website (as seen above), the effect is a reduction in product competition.","3440":"Had there been intervention, there would now be a level playing field with Google's competitors being able to compete fairly and equally.The issue with Article 101 is the requirement for 'agreement' - this may not always exist in traditional form when algorithmic pricing tools are used. Some development is therefore likely to be needed to allow the principle of Article 101 to be used in new situations.Google\u2019s current remedy attempts in the EU have failed to restore competition. The shopping remedy is designed to send traffic direct from Google to merchants, something which was a key part of Google\u2019s abusive behaviour and which continues to starve rivals of users and the opportunity to compete. In the Adsense case, Google has implemented no specific remedy to restore competition to the market and no change can come about without intervention. ","3441":"Furthermore, the two-sided markets in the Shopping and Adsense cases have, because of the long period of Google\u2019s abuse, tipped in Google\u2019s favour. More needs to be done to recreate a competitive cycle and bring back all the benefits of competition in those markets. Whilst a structural remedy may have an impact, an effective behavioural remedy would be quicker, less interventionist and, most importantly, more effective. In the shopping case, an effective remedy must restore the flow of users to rivals, allowing the two-sided market to rebalance and competition to be restored. Such a remedy is within reach; but further action is required to make this restoration a reality.\nPlease refer to our response in 16.2Please refer to our response in 16.2Please refer to our response in 16.2Early intervention will preserve competition and choice - and a level playing field. Businesses and consumers would have benefitted significantly from earlier intervention in the market, preventing Google from cementing its position in the CSS market and other verticals.Whilst Article 102 is the more appropriate instrument to intervene early to preserve and improve competition, the process to prove dominance is a complex and lengthy one. A 'no fault' approach would be more flexible.Please refer to our responses in 5.1 and 18.2","3442":"Google's abusive market behaviour is tantamount to being a gatekeeper of the internet.

The value of a regulator would be that it could move more quickly, but having to prove dominance would slow it down. Additionally,  a structural break up of Google should be a last resort if behavioural remedies and the continued enforcement of competition law cannot provide a sufficient incentive for Google to comply.","3445":"Whilst digital markets would benefit most from rapid enforcement, many other markets are 'digitising' and the rate of change is increasing.

Google was left to decide its own non discriminatory remedy by DG Competition. Instead Google chose self preferencing that failed to meet the principles laid out. It retained 99 per cent of the traffic and in turn, almost all of the economic value.\nThe remedy missed the point; it wasn\u2019t prescriptive and failed to address the market abuse and consumer harm ","3446":"Breaking up a company doesn't necessarily solve the structural issue or restore competition or choice. A structural break up of Google should be a last resort if behavioural remedies and the continued enforcement of competition law cannot provide a sufficient incentive for Google to comply. We believe there are still options for a restoration of competition through behavioural remedies. With further pressure on Google, there could be a restoration of competition through behavioural enforcement without the need for break up.\n ","3447":"Investigative powers would lend themselves to the Commission having early discovery which in turn would help with early intervention. They are key to ensuring full and frank disclosures and would ensure greater transparency.The above would ensure full transparency and cooperation which is essential. Without companies having to comply by law, they will inevitably continue their current market abuse to the detriment of competition and consumers.Without companies having to comply by law, they will inevitably draw out the process and nothing will change. They will continue their current market abuse to the detriment of competition and consumers.If a potential issue is identified early on and addressed, it limits the harm to the market.Voluntary commitments are just that - voluntary and without any legal bindings, businesses will continue not to be accountable. Voluntary commitments will inevitably amount to nothing more than lip service, similarly to Google being able to choose its own remedy that only works for Google.As a business that has been damaged by Google and continues to be so, now through its self preferencing remedy, we believe having an opportunity to review the findings and comment is key if anti competitivie issues are to be resolved.Please refer to our response in 37.1\nAdditionally, we know only too well what happens when a business is left to choose its own remedy - Google naturally chose self preferencing and our business continues to be damaged by its abusive market behaviour.To ensure its effectiveness and real life practicality.It\u2019s clear that regulation and remedies must be enshrined in legislation. We believe that regulation can only work if it\u2019s set up on a successful anti-trust remedy. It\u2019s imperative that DG COMP insists that Google proposes a remedy that creates a level playing field. Regulation based on the current Shopping remedy will be a disaster.","3448":"We support  the proposed legislation in principle, particularly the blacklist of practices including prohibitions on self-preferencing by gatekeeping platform.

It  will  present \nsome of the technical models that could be adopted, explaining them to a non-technical \naudience,  and  then  discuss  the  public  policy  benefits  and  implications  of  interoperable \nmessaging in general and of each model. ","3462":"The  second,  instant  messaging,  does  not  however  work  in  the  same  way,  as  most \nmessaging services are closed and only available through a single service provider that \ncontrols all aspects of the service. Users do not have a choice and are forced to maintain \nmultiple accounts on multiple systems, and to concentrate in those services where most \nusers already are. As a result, the market is oligopolistic and hard to contest. ","3463":"Full interoperability also requires the definition of a set of interoperable features, which are \nto be supported uniformly by all messaging services (while still allowing each service to \ndevelop  its  own  additional  features),  and  of  globally  unique  user  identifiers  that  can \npinpoint users globally across all services (possibly, as with e-mail, based on the Domain \nName System). ","3464":"In section 5 we will present two different interoperability obligations that could be inserted \nin upcoming regulation. Option A, a requirement for dominant services to publish their own \ninteroperation  interface  and  API,  would  establish  client  interoperability;  option  B,  a \nrequirement for dominant services to publish a standard interoperation interface and API \nand to interact with other services, supporting a standard set of interoperable features and \nstandard  globally  unique  user  identifiers,  would  establish  full  interoperability.  Option  B \nwould also require a technical policy process based on \u201cguided consensus\u201d to define and \nmaintain the common technical standards. We also note how these obligations should only \napply to dominant services that overcome certain thresholds of usership and relevance. ","3465":"In terms of competition, option A would create a market for alternative client applications \nbut only offer more limited opportunities for competition among services, while option B \nwould create a more competitive market for messaging services as well; thus we argue \nthat  full  interoperability  is  necessary  if  user  choice  and  competition  for  service  is  the \nobjective. ","3466":"In terms of privacy, we note that the user\u2019s privacy is protected if the message is safely \ndelivered to the intended recipients, and this is independent from whether the recipients \nuse the same or another service provider, as long as providers are properly regulated and \ntrusted by the communicating parties. In this respect, option B, by giving users choice on \nservice providers, makes it easier for them to pick a party they trust; and by allowing the \nestablishment of competing service providers, including providers located in jurisdictions \nwith strong privacy protection (like Europe) and with business models other than user data \nmonetization, incentivizes providers to compete on better privacy protection. ","3467":"Social media, while mostly being a content hosting, aggregation and curation service, also \ngenerally include a messaging component, as a way to notify in real time the appearance \nof  new  content  and  as  an  additional  communications  service  among  users.  This \nmessaging component would be key to making social media interoperable as well \u2013 hence \nthe relevance of this document to social media as well. ","3468":"Each messaging service adopts a messaging system, a set of technical and functional \nspecifications that define how the service works. Some messaging systems are proprietary \nand  just  used  by  a  single  messaging  service,  while  other  systems  are  used  by  many \ndifferent services. In the latter case, the services sharing the same system could also be \ninteroperable and allow communications across multiple service providers; or they could \njust  use  the  same  system  independently,  without  interoperating2.  Thus,  interoperable \nmessaging  requires  both  a  messaging  system  that  supports  interoperability  and \nmessaging services and service providers that choose to use that system to interoperate. ","3469":"1 The terms \u201cchat\u201d and \u201cinstant messaging\u201d are now generally used interchangeably, but originally \u201cinstant \nmessaging\u201d  was  introduced  for  SMS-like,  smartphone-based  messaging  services  aimed  at  one-on-one \nconversations with personal contacts, while \u201cchat\u201d is an older term often encompassing one-to-many, room-\nbased virtual discussions, including with strangers. In the end, both types of systems converged towards the \nsame functionalities, though often with very different user interfaces. ","3470":"2 For example, Skype is a messaging service and also a proprietary messaging system, with its own unique \ntechnical  and  functional  specifications;  Skype  (the  company)  is  the  only  service  provider  for  the  Skype \nmessaging system. On the other hand, Jabber\/XMPP is a standard protocol and messaging system which \nis used by many different services and service providers, generally in an interoperable way but sometimes \nalso to establish private messaging services that do not interoperate with the other services that use the \nsame system and specifications.  ","3471":"\u2022  An  IM  user  can  only  communicate  with  other  IM  users  of  the  same  system  and \nservice  provider;  to  communicate  with  users  of  other  service  providers,  the  user \nneeds to create additional accounts on those other systems. \nIM users can only use the application and interface provided by the service provider \nand can only access the service from the devices that the service provider supports. ","3472":"There is no technical reason for this difference between email and chat; it is just the result \nof market dynamics and of business strategies aimed at market capture. The rest of this \ndocument  will  provide  examples  of  how  instant  messaging  services  could  be  made \ninteroperable and discuss the public policy issues and effects of such a change. ","3473":"4 If  the  user\u2019s  contacts  are  also  subscribed  to  the  new  IM  system,  and  if  the  two  systems  use  the  same \nidentifier (for example, a telephone number), it might be that the moving user will find the old contacts on the \nnew  system  automatically,  and  will  be  able  to  start  new  conversations  with  them.  However,  past \nconversations will still be lost, and anyway this only works under the two restrictive conditions above.  ","3474":"Each  messaging  system  is  technically  different  \u2013  but  not  too  much.  We  will  describe \nconcepts  that  can  apply  to  any  messaging  system,  though  different  systems  often  use \ndifferent  names  to  refer  to  them.  These  concepts  will  allow  us  to  discuss  the  different \npossible architectures for interoperability and their public policy effects. ","3475":"Each user of a messaging system is associated to a unique user identifier, which allows \nthe other users to identify them and send them messages. The user identifier can assume \nmultiple forms; it can be directly related to the location of the user on the network, so that \nit can be immediately used to deliver the messages, or it can be an abstract identifier like \na (phone) number or a nickname. ","3476":"In many service architectures, the user is also associated to a home server, i.e. a server \nwhere  their  messages  are  delivered,  and  from  where  the  user\u2019s  client  applications  will \nretrieve the messages to show them. This allows messages to be delivered even when the \nuser  is  offline  or  is  using  a  device  (e.g.  a  mobile  phone)  which  has  limited  or  private \nconnectivity to the Internet and thus cannot be reached directly by the sender.  ","3477":"In closed systems, there is no choice of home server; the owner of the service will silently \nprovide one. In open, federated systems, users pick a server of their choice; in this case, \nsenders  need  to  know  which  one  it  is,  and  this  information  is  often  stored  in  the  user \nidentifier5. ","3478":"In some \u201cserverless\u201d architectures, there is no home server, and messages can only be \ndelivered directly to the user\u2019s client application, with increased privacy and simplicity, but \nalso with the disadvantage that no messages can be sent while the user is offline. Even in \nthis case, however, there often is a centralized directory server that allows senders to \ndiscover  the  user\u2019s  current  location.  A  directory  server,  or  a  distributed  database  like  a \nblockchain  or  the  DNS,  can  also  be  used  in  federated  server-based  architectures  to \ndiscover the user\u2019s home server from an abstract identifier. ","3479":"5 This  mirrors  the  email  architecture,  in  which  the  \u201chome  server\u201d,  i.e.  the  user\u2019s  mail  server  where  their \nmailbox is located, is specified in the email address by the email domain, the part after the \u2018@\u2019 sign, which \ncan then be converted into an actual server name and IP address via DNS queries. ","3480":"\u2022  Messaging client software, to be run on user-facing devices such as computers \nand  smartphones,  receives  incoming  messages  from  the  home  server,  displays \nthem to the user and delivers the replies back to the server - or, in architectures \nwithout  home  servers,  directly  exchanges  messages  with  the  client  software  of \nother users.  ","3481":"\u2022  Full  interoperability  requires  that  the  user  of  one  messaging  service  (\u201chome \nservice\u201d) can communicate with one or more users (\u201cremote users\u201d) of the other \nmessaging service (\u201cremote service\u201d) as if they were users of their own messaging \nservice. Consequently, any messaging client is able to interact with any messaging \nserver; users can switch from their current client to another compatible client, and \nservice providers can pick and switch between any server software. Users can also \nmove from a server to another, and thus from a service provider to another, without \nlosing their message archive and contacts, as long as data portability is effectively \nimplemented. ","3482":"\u2022  Client  interoperability  does  not  allow  actual  communication  between  users  of \ndifferent services, but allows the development of alternative third-party clients for \nthe same service, and thus of clients that can interact with multiple services at once. \nUsers can use a single application to interact with multiple services, but within that \napplication, conversations and contacts are still broken into a separate silo for each \nmessaging  service.  Clients  are  interchangeable  with  other  clients,  but  servers ","3483":"Interoperability  across  multiple  services \nis  almost \nstraightforward,  but  if  the  services  use  different  systems,  their  technical  and  functional \ndifference  comes  into  play.  Client  interoperability  is  not  too  hampered  by  a  diversity  of \nfeatures across multiple messaging systems, as the client can tailor the user experience \nfor each system. However, full interoperability can be hampered by the fact that different \nmessaging systems have different or incompatible features.  ","3484":"Thus, for full interoperability it is also necessary to define a set of interoperable features, \ni.e.  features  that  both  services  are  required  to  support  in  a  shared  way  so  that  they \nsubstantially work in the same way (though, for example, the user interface through which \nthey are presented to the user may differ substantially, and unique additional features can \nbe added by each service on top of the standard ones). ","3485":"\u2022  Accessing the remote user\u2019s presence information; \n\u2022  Adding the remote user to the user\u2019s contacts list; \n\u2022  Adding the remote user to a group\/room on the home service; \n\u2022  Being added to a group\/room on the remote service; \n\u2022  Sending to users and groups\/rooms of the remote service messages made of any ","3486":"6  In  technical  terms,  there  are  architectural  options  that  could  influence  the  definition  in  detail  of  the \ninteroperable features. For example, the delivery of a message to a remote user could either happen directly \n(the user\u2019s client connects to the remote user\u2019s home server) or through the user\u2019s home server (the user\u2019s \nclient connects to the user\u2019s home server, then the user\u2019s home server connects to the remote user\u2019s home \nserver and relays the message). These details can however be agreed and formalized when defining the \ntechnical standard for full interoperability. ","3487":"Today\u2019s  messaging  applications  increasingly  include  not  just  the  ability  to  attach \naudiovisual content (e.g. vocal messages or videos) to text messages, but the ability to \nperform  real-time  voice  or  video  calls  between  contacts;  some  convergence  between \nvideo-conferencing applications and instant messaging applications is already happening. \nFrom  a  technical  standpoint,  this  capability  requires  additional,  dedicated  infrastructure \nand standards, and specific security and anti-spam considerations. Consequently, whether \nthis capability should be included in the set of interoperable features \u2013 also considering \nthe potential regulatory overlap with \u201cplain old\u201d telephony \u2013 is open for discussion. ","3488":"Full  interoperability,  in  functional  terms,  does  not  require  that  any  of  the  interoperating \nmessaging systems are open or use open protocols; as long as they establish ways to \nexchange  messages  and  information  among  themselves,  each  of  them  could  then \ncontinue  working  as  a  closed  service  with  a  single  provider  and  no  alternative  client \napplications.  However,  as  described  in  section  5,  we  would  recommend  achieving  full \ninteroperability  by  requiring  all  participant  messaging  services  to  publish  a  standard \ninterface  and  make  it  accessible  to  any  third-party  client,  as  this  would  enable  much \nbroader positive effects on competition, and ensure that new entrants can join the market. ","3489":"All participating services are required to set up a public interface (either one for the whole \nservice, or one on each server), and to disclose an API or protocol that clients can use to \ncommunicate  with  it.  This  can  be  the  same  API  that  the  service  already  uses  for \ncommunication with its own clients, thus not requiring additional development efforts by \nservice providers; in any case, the API must support all the features of the service, allowing \nthe development of independent clients that offer all the same functionalities of the \u201cnative\u201d \none. Services are then required to accept communications to this interface by any client, \nexcept for the possible refusal of connections from abusive clients (e.g. for spam). ","3490":"On the other hand, interoperation between services would in fact be limited; this approach \nwould basically work like conflating all client applications side by side into one, rather than \nlike having a single application that can effectively talk with all messaging services at once \nand all their users in the same way, independently from the service they use. A service \ncould still behave like a client, connect to a competing service and perform some exchange \nof  messages,  but  the  lack  of  a  uniform  set  of  interoperable  features  and  of  a  common \ntechnical standard would not allow this method to support all features flawlessly, or even \nto support them at all. In practice, this model can only achieve client interoperability, not \nfull interoperability7. ","3491":"This  approach  moves  all  the  complexity  of  the  interoperation  into  clients.  As  such,  this \napproach  is  less  burdensome  for  service  providers  (except  those  that  may  still  want  to \nattempt  service-to-service  interoperation),  but  more  burdensome  for  any  independent \ndeveloper willing to build an alternative client application to compete with the established, \ndominant ones.  ","3492":"In fact, it could easily happen that client developers would limit themselves to implementing \nthe  APIs  for  the  few  most  used  messaging  services,  avoiding  the  effort  necessary  to \nsupport  additional  APIs  for  less  used  services;  this  would  hamper  the  chances  of \nsuccessful  competition  by  new  entrants  and  by  services  that  do  not  already  have  a \nsignificant market share. ","3493":"Also, this model does not free users from being locked into specific services if they do not \nwant to lose their contacts and conversations. It just makes multi-homing easier by allowing \nusers to manage all services from a single app, which is a practical advantage over having \nto install multiple apps, but not as big as being actually able to switch in full to a competing \nservice provider. ","3494":"An  open,  standardized  server-side  API  or  client-server  protocol  is  defined,  and  all \nparticipating  services  are  required  to  set  up  a  public  interface  (either  one  for  the  whole \nservice, or one on each server) that can exchange communications using that standard. \nServices are then also required to accept communications to this interface by any client, \nexcept for the possible refusal of connections from abusive clients (e.g. for spam). ","3495":" \n \n  \n \n \n \n\ffor the standard set of interoperable features that is supported by the standard protocol; \nany additional features of the specific service would not be accessible through third-party \nclients. Service providers would also need to add within their server software support for \nthe  interoperation  with  users  of  other  messaging  services,  such  as  (depending  on  the \nactual  technical  architecture  of  the  common  standard)  connecting  with  other  servers  to \ndeliver and receive messages. ","3496":"Service providers would also need to publish a way to convert their own user identifiers \ninto  globally  unique  user  identifiers  in  the  standard  protocol,  so  that  their  users  can  be \nidentified  uniquely  throughout  all  interoperating  services.  However,  service  providers \nwould not be required to disclose their own protocols or the internals of their system. ","3497":"This approach is more burdensome for service providers, but less burdensome for client \ndevelopers. It could increase the development costs for the creation of new messaging \nservices; however, once the standard is created, new services would possibly just natively \ndesign  their  implementation  according  to  the  standard,  without  the  need  to  develop \nadditional \u201ctranslation\u201d elements. On the other hand, this approach would make it much \neasier  to  create  new  clients,  fostering  innovation,  competition  and  diversity  in  terms  of \nuser-facing applications. ","3498":"As a drawback, this model requires the agreement on a common messaging system and \non  a  set  of  interoperable  features;  such  agreement  needs  to  be  overseen  so  that  it \nmaximizes  the  public  interest,  as  private-sector-led  standardization  processes  could \ninstead agree on a standard that favours certain dominant players. Processes to update \nthe standard and the set of features would also need to be established. ","3499":"It requires the establishment of separate \u201ctranslation\u201d services (usually named bridges) \nthat would be capable of \u201cspeaking\u201d the different protocols and messaging systems for two \nor more interoperable services; the clients of one service, when needing to interoperate \nwith the users of a different one, would connect to an appropriate bridge that would receive \nthe  requests  according  to  the  client\u2019s  own  system,  convert  them  into  the  system  of  the \nother service, and relay them to the other service\u2019s servers \u2013 and do the opposite for the \nreplies. Again, service providers would then be required to disclose their protocols\/APIs \nand make an interface publicly available, like in the first model; however, only bridges, not \nclients, would connect to this interface. ","3500":"In  this  model,  the  burden  of  interoperability  is  borne  neither  by  the  clients  nor  by  the \nservers, but by a specialized party that develops and runs the bridging servers. This makes \nthe model very flexible, as any interoperability issues can be solved by the bridging party, \nwithout  the  need  to  change  clients  or  servers.  This  also  makes  all  existing  clients  and \nservers almost immediately able to interoperate with very few modifications. ","3501":"However,  this  model  requires  that  a  third  party  supports  a  significant  cost  for  the \ndevelopment and operation of the bridges; it is unclear which business model such a party \ncould  actually  have.  One  could  imagine  new  startups  offering  bridging  as  an  additional \nservice; however, since messaging is generally a free service for the final users, it is hard \nto imagine that users would accept to pay a fee just for the interoperation mechanism. New \nentrants could rather be interested in supporting the costs for bridging with the dominant \nservices8,  as  this  could  substantially  increase  their  adoption,  but  doing  so  through  this \nmodel would impose the cost of interoperation onto new entrants. ","3502":"Option B requires a process to pick or design the open standard that every service will \nhave to support, the set of interoperable features and a design for globally unique user \nidentifiers. To this purpose, we recommend a process of \u201cguided consensus\u201d in which the \nindustry, with the participation of user and civil society organizations, is required to agree \nas  far  as  possible  on  a  proposal  for  a  common  standard  \u2013  or  more  than  one,  if  no \nconsensus  is  possible  \u2013  in  a  reasonable  timeframe,  while  a  regulatory  agency  with \nappropriate technical and policy capabilities then validates the proposal, ensuring that it \nmeets  the  overall  policy  objectives  and  that  the  standard  is  effectively  accessible  to  all ","3503":"8  This  has  indeed  happened  within  past  and  current  attempts  to  build  open  interoperable  messaging \nsystems, where members of the community have often volunteered to develop and run bridges towards other \nmessaging systems, so to make the new system more useful. However, this has only happened on a small, \nexperimental scale that could be managed only with volunteered resources. ","3504":" \n \n  \n \n \n \n\fimplementers (including non-profit, community and open source ones). To this purpose, \nsuch standard should be available free of charge and unencumbered by any intellectual \nproperty and patent licensing costs and restrictions. Existing standards could already be \nconsidered, or existing Internet standard bodies could be used to develop these standards, \nthough  there  needs  to  be  care  in  ensuring  that  whatever  process  is  chosen  cannot  be \ncaptured or disrupted by the dominant players. ","3505":"Both  options  would  also  need  the  establishment  of  additional  guarantees,  such  as  the \nprohibition for service providers of refusing access to their open interfaces, except for a \nlimited number of clearly defined cases (for example, abuse for security attacks, attempts \nat spamming or denial of service, etc.) with appropriate redress measures for contested \ncases9. ","3506":"Both  models  require  a  definition  of  when  a  messaging  service  can  be  considered \n\u201cdominant\u201d. Regulation could just refer to very high level principles, such as market share \nand number of users (across Europe or in individual countries), economic relevance (for \nexample in terms of advertising revenues, for services based on that business model) and \nconsolidation  effects  (messaging  services  native  to  dominant  platforms,  e.g.  dominant \nbrowsers,  dominant  operating  systems  or  dominant  social  media,  should  also  be \nconsidered dominant). A regulatory agency could then be tasked with defining them further \nand solving any quarrel on whether a specific service is dominant.  ","3507":"Some  argue  that  even  if  you  introduce  full  interoperability  and  allow  people  to \ncommunicate across messaging services, this will not be effective if the current dominant \nclients are not required to add support for such communication. The final effect could then \nbe that a few users move to alternative services and a few other users move from dominant \nclients to new multi-service applications, but since the apps that people already use do not \nallow communication with users of other services and do not even show the fact that other \nservices now exist, most users will just stay with the dominant service and client. ","3508":"The lack of interoperability, together with the strong network effects inherent in messaging, \nis a root cause of reduced competition in the Internet messaging market. Users need to \nuse  the  messaging  system  where  their  intended  recipients  are,  and  this  reinforces  and \nossifies the position of the current dominant services, that can push users to adopt their \nown client applications at their own conditions. Any attempt to enter the market with a new \nmessaging service is significantly hampered by the fact that its users will not be able to \ncommunicate  with  anyone,  unless  they  can  convince  other  users  to  join  yet  another \nmessaging  system.  Also,  any  attempt  to  enter  the  market  with  alternative  client \napplications,  even  if  better  and  more  useful,  is  made  impossible  by  the  fact  that  most \nmessaging services only allow access to their servers from their own client application or \nwebsite. ","3509":"Moreover,  most  dominant  messaging  services  today  are  provided  by  big  Internet \ncompanies  that  also  provide  many  other  services;  their  dominance  of  the  messaging \nmarket and the exploitation of the user base gained through such widely used services \ncould reinforce their dominance in other markets and vice versa, creating anti-competitive \nnetwork effects. ","3510":"Drawing  on  past  regulatory  experiences  (e.g.  with  mobile  telephony),  it  is  generally \naccepted  that  the  introduction  of  opportunities  for  interoperability  and  portability  across \nservice providers reduces the advantage for dominant players and creates opportunities \nfor  more  choice  for  the  users  and  for  more  competition  on  the  market;  this  is  generally \nbeneficial to society at large.  ","3511":"Option A (client interoperability) creates more choice in terms of client apps, and favours \nmulti-homing, but does not address in full the problem of users being locked into specific \nservices, nor that of promoting the creation of new competing messaging services. The \nlack of standardization of the server interface makes client development complex, and can \npush client developers to limit the number of services they support; the migration from one \nservice to another is made harder by the lack of a standardized set of common features, \nand  service  providers  can  even  try  to  exacerbate  on  purpose  their  differences  to  make \nmoving  even  harder,  or  evolve  their  own  server  interface  in  ways  that  make  third-party \nclients less effective. Since there is no direct communication between users of different \nservices,  the  service  provider  that  the  user  employs  is  still  all-important  in  the  ability  to \ncommunicate, preserving vendor lock-in. ","3512":"Option B (full interoperability) creates more choice not just in clients, but also in terms of \nservers and service providers. As there is a set of common features and a single common \ntechnical  specification,  moving  from  one  service  to  another  is  much  easier.  The \ndevelopment  of  clients  and  of  servers  is  easier,  leading  to  more  opportunities  for  new \nentrants in both niches. The evolution of the common technical standard happens jointly \nby all participants, avoiding unilateral changes to specifications that can create costs and \nbreak interoperation. Even with limitations and the need for constant regulatory oversight ","3513":"As  an  alternative,  full  interoperability  could  also  be  obtained  through  the  \u201cthird-party \nbridging\u201d  model,  coupling  option  A  with  the  definition  of  a  common  set  of  interoperable \nfeatures and with the establishment of third-party bridging and interoperability services. As \nwe noted, it is hard to imagine that users would pay an interoperability service fee directly \nwhen  all  the  messaging  services  themselves  are  available  for  free;  this  would  put  the \nburden of establishing and funding bridging services on those parties who have the highest \ninterest  in  that,  i.e.  the  new  entrants,  rather  than  on  the  dominant  messaging  services, \nreducing the positive effect on competition. ","3514":"An often forgotten effect of services that allow alternative clients to exist is that they enable \nmuch better access by those users that have special needs, for any of several reasons \n(disabilities, use of minority languages, etc.). While the specific efforts by some players \nare commendable, big service providers designing their client applications need to focus \non streamlining the user experience for the majority of users, as this is what will determine \nthe success of their service. On the other hand, many groups would benefit from the use \nof  specialized,  tailored  client  applications  designed  for  their  own  specific  needs;  by \nenabling the creation of independent clients, these specialized applications are also made \npossible. Both options, A and B, would thus have beneficial effects for accessibility and \ninclusiveness. ","3515":"The  privacy  model  for  messaging  is  straightforward:  each  user  of  a  messaging  service \nexpects that each message is only made available to the destination user(s) they selected. \nAny other party having access to the content of the communication, including the service \nprovider(s), is unduly violating the user\u2019s right to privacy. ","3516":"The second requirement is independent from the technology and its regulation, while the \nfirst and the third are directly connected to them; but all three points depend on the user\u2019s \nability  to  trust  both  the  recipients  and  the  technology  providers  involved  in  the \ncommunication.  So,  how  would \nintroduction  of \ninteroperability? ","3517":"While  the  recipients  and  their  trustworthiness  do  not  change,  the  introduction  of \ninteroperability gives the user a much better choice of technology providers. Indeed, if a \nuser today wants to send a message to a contact residing on a specific platform, either the \nuser trusts the platform, no matter what policies and privacy guarantees the platform offers, \nor the communication cannot happen.  ","3518":"With interoperability, the user will be able to choose a different technology provider (just \nfor  the  client  application,  with  client  interoperability;  also  for  the  service,  with  full \ninteroperability).  This  allows  the  user  to  gain  back  choice  and  control  over  which  data \nprocessor will get their messaging data and to select providers that can be trusted, creating \nat the same time an incentive for providers to compete in privacy-oriented features that \ncan enhance the user\u2019s trust in them. ","3519":"It is true that, with interoperability, the sending users only control half of the communication, \nand, in comparison with today\u2019s closed platforms, an additional party comes into play; as \nthe communication also relies on the service provider of the recipient, they have to trust \nthat provider as well \u2013 sometimes without even knowing which provider it is. This is not \ndifferent  from  what  happens  with  email  or  telephony;  when  I  call  a  friend,  my \ncommunication  also  transits  over  the  friend\u2019s  mobile  operator,  which  could  attack  my \nprivacy  or  could  use  insecure  implementations  that  allow  data  leaks  and  third-party \nattacks. This happens at any time without being considered a privacy issue in itself, due \nto  the  combination  of  regulatory  oversight  (imposing  and  enforcing  privacy  and  data \nprotection rules) and of trust in the recipient, which includes trusting the fact that he\/she \nwill have chosen a reliable provider.  ","3520":"Moreover,  users  could  easily  learn  from  their  app  which  other  provider  the  recipient  is \nusing, and if they dislike the idea of having their communications go through that provider, \nthey could just stop the communication or invite their contact to move to a more trusted \nprovider. Interoperability would give users the ability to communicate with users of other \nproviders, but would never force them to do so if they do not want. ","3521":"In the end, we argue that users receive better privacy from an ecosystem of providers and \nclient applications that have to make compelling offers to users to gain their trust, rather \nthan by a single all-in-one provider which they cannot choose and with which they have no \nnegotiating power; so option B, despite a broader circulation of information and messages, \nwould be the most beneficial to privacy.  ","3522":" \n \n  \n \n \n\fThe  current  situation  is  also  made  worse  by  the  fact  that  many  dominant  messaging \nservices are provided by companies that also provide many other online services, creating \nopportunities for detailed user profiling and tracking across multiple online activities; these \ncompanies usually have user data monetization as their core business model, creating an \neconomic incentive for them to reduce the privacy offered by their messaging systems. ","3523":"This is even more problematic for European users, if we consider that almost all current \nproviders are based outside of the European Union and of its privacy-focused approaches \nto technology; if a user wanted to get their messaging services from a European company, \nthey would have a hard time finding one their contacts also use. ","3524":"In  any  case,  additional  guarantees  could  be  introduced  to  improve  privacy  levels;  for \nexample, a common standard interface for instant messaging could include features that \nprovide information on the provider\u2019s name and location and on the country it is located in, \nwhile users could instruct their client applications to avoid sending data to services located \noutside  of  the  European  Union,  if  they  so  wanted.  This  kind  of  meta-information  could \nprovide innovative opportunities for proper consent management and for full user control \nover the transmission of data. However, there are cases in which the service provider does \nnot want to disclose additional information on who and where they are, for example for \nservices  aimed  at  protecting  sensitive  communications  (journalists,  whistleblowers, \ndissidents etc.) \u2013 so any metadata disclosure should be optional. ","3525":"In managed app-to-app encryption, the messaging application also takes care to create, \nstore and manage the encryption keys used in communications; as a consequence, the \nencrypted  channel  only  connects  the  sender\u2019s  app  with  the  recipient\u2019s  app,  and  the \napplication, and thus the service provider, has full access to the unencrypted content of \nany communication. In this case, the service provider (notwithstanding their claims) could \nin theory analyse the content of the message or even covertly relay it to its servers or to \nother  parties.  Also,  app-to-app  encryption  mechanisms  often  leave  the  metadata  of  the \nconversation (sender, recipient, date etc.) out in clear. ","3526":"In full end-to-end encryption, it is up to the users to encipher and decipher the messages \nusing a separate cryptography application, or at least to create and manage the encryption \nkeys, so that the messaging application only ever gets access to encrypted content. It is \nhowever very hard to design an end-to-end encrypted messaging application that is also \neasy to use for non-technical consumers; thus, app-to-app encryption is the model adopted \nby most service providers. ","3527":"We  do  not  want  to  enter  here  into  the  policy  debate  on  encryption;  the  GDPR  already \nmandates  the  use  of  state-of-the-art  technologies  to  protect  communications,  and  any \nfurther specification about encryption would be better dealt with in other regulations (e.g. \nin  an  ePrivacy  Regulation).  Still,  we  challenge  any  claim  that  the  use  of  \u201cend-to-end \nencryption\u201d by a messaging service, when meaning app-to-app encryption, is an inherent \nguarantee  of  absolute  privacy,  especially  when  the  service  provider  is  also  a  company \nwhose business model is based on advertising and user monetization.  ","3528":" \n \n  \n \n \n\fHowever,  for  encryption  to  be  possible  and  secure  in  an  interoperable  scenario,  the \nencryption  mechanisms  used  by  the  sender  and  by  the  recipient,  and  by  their  service \nproviders,  need  to  be  interoperable  as  well.  This  is  easier  to  accomplish  in  the  full \ninteroperability model, as the adoption of a single, common, open standard can include \ncommon ways to signal which encryption algorithm is being adopted and exchange the \nnecessary  cryptographic  information 11.  Under  these  conditions,  encryption  will  not  be \nweakened  or  impeded  by  moving  from  a  set  of  separate  services  to  an  ecosystem  of \ninteroperable ones. ","3529":"Privacy of the communication itself is not the only form of privacy applying to messaging. \nIndeed, any communications system \u2013 even plain old telephony \u2013 is nowadays subject to \nspam, and to the harvesting of contacts to that purpose. Also, the contacts list of a user \ncan  reveal  highly  sensitive  information;  it  deserves  full  privacy  protection.  Even  the \npresence information needs some degree of protection. ","3530":"When designing an architecture for interoperability, care should thus be taken to ensure \ndatabases  of  users  and  user  identifiers  are  not  made  public  and  cannot  be  easily \nreconstructed  from  existing  public  information  or  by  guessing,  and  that  the  presence \ninformation of a user is only available to their contacts. There are technical solutions to this \nproblem, such as non-guessable identifiers, and cryptographic tokens that a user\u2019s client \ncan distribute to contacts to allow their clients to access the user\u2019s presence information \non their home server. ","3531":"A basic measure to prevent spam is to only accept messages from senders that have been \npreviously  added  as  contacts.  Email,  however,  does  not  have  such  a  feature;  this \nincreased the problem of email spam, but also supported the use of email as a universal \nmessaging system where anyone with your address can write to you.  ","3532":"In the end, we think any standard interoperable messaging system should support both \nmodalities, and it should be a choice by each user whether they want to accept messages \nfrom unknown senders or not; also, a competitive service environment could push service \nproviders to deploy reputation- and algorithm-based anti-spam features, like the ones that \nexist for email. ","3533":"While the environment may not be the primary concern in messaging systems, the need \nto install and run multiple messaging applications at once, instead of a single one, causes \na waste of precious technical resources, especially on more constrained devices such as \nmobile phones. The increased use of energy, bandwidth, computational power and storage \nspace  contributes  to  the  quicker  obsolescence  of  the  device  and  increases  the \nenvironmental footprint of messaging activities, which becomes significant once multiplied ","3534":"11 In cryptographic systems, security is never obtained by hiding the encryption algorithm from public scrutiny \nor by adopting non-standard, proprietary algorithms. On the contrary, the adoption of well known, publicly \ntested,  standardized  algorithms  strengthens  security;  the  secrecy  of  the  conversation  is  given  by  proper \nconfidential treatment of the private encryption keys and secrets, not by the confidentiality of the algorithm \nitself. This is why the standardization of encryption mechanisms actually contributes to better security.  ","3535":"We reject this claim; even if the requirement for full interoperability (option B in section 5) \nwere  to  be  adopted,  this  would  not  prevent  each  service  provider  and  each  application \ndeveloper from implementing additional features that are out of the interoperable set, and \nfrom using them to draw users to their service or app.  ","3536":"It would be easy (and we recommend so) to design any standard messaging protocol in a \nway  that  allows  the  unilateral  deployment  of  extensions  to  support  additional  features, \neven before they are standardized or added to the regulatory set of interoperable features. \nIn fact, this is how innovation has worked for email in the last decades. ","3537":"Moreover, nothing would prevent the current dominant messaging services, which control \nboth the client app and the server, from having their app connect to their server in non-\nstandard ways through a separate interface, supporting even more non-standard features. \nIt would be up to the process that defines the set of interoperable features to determine if \nand when these additional features need to be added to the set to grant all services access \nto them. ","3538":"While  this  paper  focuses  on  interoperable  messaging,  its  principles  and  considerations \nwould still generally be valid for social media as well. Social media services are generally \nclosed and based on single service providers that control the entire service and do not \ninteroperate  with  others;  they  present  the  same  scenario,  and  the  same  drawbacks,  as \ninstant messaging.  ","3539":"Technical architectures for social media systems vary, but in general, the core of social \nmedia is about messaging; whenever a user creates a new post, the post is stored on their \nhome server and either the entire post or a notification message is sent to a \u201cmailbox\u201d on \nthe home server of their followers, where a web client or a client app can retrieve them for \ndisplay. To avoid the unnecessary circulation of big media files, media attachments such \nas  photos  and  videos  are  hosted  in  a  single  place,  on  the  user\u2019s  home  server  or \nsomewhere else on the service platform, and referenced in messages through links, so \nthat clients can retrieve them only when necessary. ","3540":"For example, in terms of privacy, each new social media posting either is public \u2013 and thus \nit is meant to be accessible to anyone, like a page on a website \u2013 or has a specific intended \naudience, becoming just like a message sent to a finite set of recipients; the audience can \nbe restricted as defined by the poster independently from the service that each member of \nthe audience is using. Furthermore, media content would generally not be hosted outside \nof  the  user\u2019s  home  service,  and  thus  would  not  be  subject  to  additional  circulation  or \ncopying other than the intended recipients downloading it. ","3541":"We  have  explained  how  Internet  messaging  systems  work,  introduced  two  different \ndegrees of interoperability \u2013 client interoperability and full interoperability \u2013 and provided \nthree  different  technical  models  for  interoperation  \u2013  multi-protocol  clients,  standardized \nserver  interfaces  and  third-party  bridging.  The  first  two  models  can  be  turned  into  two \ndifferent  interoperability  obligations  to  be  inserted  in  upcoming  regulation:  option  A  for \nclient interoperability and option B for full interoperability. ","3542":"By examining the policy consequences of the two options, we conclude that both options \nbring benefits, but option B brings more of them. In particular, option B (full interoperability) \nis  necessary  to  introduce  an  opportunity  for  choice  and  competition  among  messaging \nservices themselves, and not just among client applications. This would also benefit the \nprivacy of users, by allowing the creation of privacy-focused, European operators adopting \nbusiness  models  different  than  user  data  monetization.  It  would  not  stifle  innovation  or \nreduce data protection, but rather restore opportunities for new and better service to end-\nusers. ","3543":"We thus recommend that an interoperability obligation based on option B \u2013 a requirement \nfor  all  dominant  service  providers  to  expose  an  interface  based  on  an  open,  standard \nprotocol,  to  accept  connections  to  it  by  any  well-behaving  client,  and  to  participate  in  a \ncommon  scheme  of  interoperable  features  and  user  identifiers  \u2013  should  be  included  in \nupcoming regulation12. This obligation should also be extended to social media. ","3544":"12 As a second-best alternative, regulators could consider establishing the obligations of option A together \nwith appropriate measures to enact the \u201cthird-party bridging\u201d model without requiring users or new entrants \nto fund its costs directly; this could be accomplished either through a neutral, publicly funded bridging service, \nor through incentives and funding for specialized startups. ","3545":"At the national level, several member States established laws requiring Internet access \nproviders  to  block  access  to  specific  content,  which  varies  widely  by  country.  In  other \nStates,  blocking  orders  have  been  imposed  by  courts.  Types  of  content  that  are  often \nblocked  include  unlicensed  or  harmful  businesses  (gambling,  pharmacies,  fake  shops), \ncopyright  violations  (live  streaming,  peer-to-peer  movie  distribution),  violent  or  harmful \nmaterial (child sexual abuse, terrorist and totalitarian propaganda) and many more2. ","3546":"1.  Uncertainty  and  liabilities.  European  ISPs  are  subject  to  contradictory  regulation: \nfrom one hand, the Open Internet Regulation strongly limits their ability to filter content, \nand from the other, national laws and court orders require them to do so. ISPs face \nconstant  criticism,  and  sometimes  lawsuits,  both  for  filtering  too  much  and  for  not \nfiltering enough. Also, depending on the interpretations, the Open Internet Regulation \nleft  it  unclear  whether  filtering  is  allowed  for  other  purposes  (e.g.  parental  control)  if \nvoluntarily requested by the user3. ","3547":"2.  Fragmentation and costs. Law-mandated content filtering is an uncompensated cost \nthat is imposed onto all ISPs. The cost is increasing due to the growing, unregulated \nadoption of encryption technologies that make it harder and more expensive to block \nconnections, especially for smaller players. International ISPs face the need to cope \nwith 27 different filtering regimes. ","3548":"3.  Lack of democratic guarantees. Given the sensitivity of the topic, member States that \nestablish  mandatory  filtering  rules  should  be  required  to  also  establish  appropriate \nredress measures to prevent over-blocking; today, this rarely happens. The owners of \nwebsites and services blocked by mistake should be able to get this mistake corrected \npromptly  and  inexpensively.  The  same  should  apply  to  security-oriented  filtering  by \nISPs themselves. ","3549":"4.  Lack of platform neutrality guarantees. Since the Open Internet Regulation does not \napply to platforms and global players, these players are free to filter content however \nthey  like,  without  the  limitations  imposed  onto  ISPs.  As  the  neutrality  guarantees  of \nArticle 3 are important, they should also apply to providers other than ISPs whenever \none of their services (for example, a DNS resolver) is used by European citizens to \nlocate and access content over the Internet. ","3550":"5.  Easy,  increasing  circumvention.  The  global  Internet  platforms  and  application \nmakers, acting outside of jurisdiction and not being affected by the existing regulations, \nare  increasingly  deploying  new  encryption  technologies  (e.g.  HTTPS,  DNS-over-\nHTTPS,  ECH\/ESNI)  that  circumvent  local  content  filters  by  default.  While  these \ntechnologies have important upsides for privacy and security, they should not be used \nin ways that deny the public interest considerations that lead ISPs to block access to \ninsecure websites and States to forbid access to harmful content. ","3551":"3 The recent revision of the BEREC Guidelines tries to address the point, but starts with the assumption that \nthe  ISP\u2019s  resolvers  are  \u201cautomatically  installed  as  default\u201d,  which  is  not  anymore  true  under  the  new \nencrypted DNS protocols, and ends in an inapplicable differentiation between \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cadditional\u201d DNS \nresolvers, while many ISPs only have a single resolver platform that can optionally perform parental control \nfor users that request it. ","3552":"The new regulation should not imply that content filtering is good or bad, nor should it aim \nat  making  it  easier  or  harder.  It  should  rather  aim  at  ensuring  that,  whenever  content \nfiltering is enacted according to existing legislation, it is implemented evenly and fairly for \nall stakeholders, without distorting competition. ","3553":"The new regulation should not enter into the definition of which content could or should be \nfiltered. The criteria set forth by the Open Internet Regulation are sound, and for the rest, \neach member State should define which content to block according to their own national \nvalues, culture, and appropriate balance of rights. ","3554":"We suggest the following principles as a possible guideline for the regulation, for example \nas paragraphs in a specific article. These principles represent Open-Xchange\u2019s view, as \nderived  from  direct  experience  of  these  issues  as  DNS  platform  vendor  to  some  of \nEurope\u2019s  biggest  ISPs;  we  stand  ready  to  discuss  and  improve  them  with  other \nstakeholders. ","3555":"1.  Generalization of the scope. A framework regulation on content filtering should not \nonly  apply  to  Internet  access  service  providers,  but  to  any  provider  of  electronic \ncommunication and information society services, software and devices that are made \navailable in the European Union (even if provided from outside it) and that can be used \nin the process of locating and accessing content over the Internet. This does not mean \nthat all these parties should be required to implement filters directly, but all these parties \nshould be required to cooperate to make them work well, according to their different \nroles in the process of accessing online content. ","3556":"3.  Even  application  of  requirements.  For  law-mandated  filtering  (case  a.  in  point  2), \nlegislation will establish which parties are required to apply the filters. However, as a \ngeneral principle, any party supplying the same kind of services, in full or in part, should \nbe subject to the same obligations. More specifically, any party that supplies services \nthat can be used to access the Internet by replacing or complementing those supplied \nby  Internet  access  service  providers,  for  example  DNS  resolution  or  alternative \nencrypted routing (VPN), should be subject to the same filtering obligations of Internet \naccess service providers. ","3557":"4.  Prohibition  of  circumvention.  All  providers  included  in  point  1  are  required  not  to \ndeploy technical features that are designed to circumvent content filters by any other \nparty. If other technical features of their products and services, not designed for that \npurpose, can still be used to that purpose, they are required to assess the risk and take \nadequate  countermeasures  to  prevent  that  usage.  All  providers  are  also  required  to \ncooperate  in  the  delivery  of  mandatory  information  to  the  user,  implementing  the \nnecessary technical standards (see point 6). ","3558":"6.  Guarantees for consumers. Users of the affected services should have the right to \nbe  informed,  whenever  technically  feasible,  that  access  is  being  blocked,  for  which \nreason and according to which of the cases in point 2. In point 2 case c., users should \nbe provided with information on how to request disabling or reconfiguring their filtering \nservice, while in case b., the provider may offer a way to proceed beyond the filter. ","3559":"7.  Guarantees for content owners. Service providers should be required to offer a way \nfor content owners to request prompt and inexpensive reconsideration of the block in \npoint 2 cases b. and c. Member States should be required to offer a similar mechanism \nfor blocks in point 2 case a. ","3560":"Optionally \u2013 also depending on how this is addressed in the overall regulation \u2013 a mandate \ncould  be  given  to  a  technical  regulator  to  clarify  how  these  principles  apply  to  specific \ntechnologies and use cases. This could also include requiring the use of technologies that \nare less intrusive for the user\u2019s privacy, for example technologies that do not perform an \nanalysis of the actual content but just of the connection\u2019s metadata (source, destination, \napplication etc.).  ","3561":"The Malta Communications Authority (MCA) welcomes the European Commission\u2019s consultation on the \nDigital Services Act package launched last June which aims at (i) proposing new and revised rules to deepen \nthe single market for digital services and (ii) having ex-ante rules to ensure that markets remain fair and \ncontestable for stakeholders. It also welcomes the Commission\u2019s consultation about a new competition \ntool,  which  if  implemented,  could  allow  it  to  impose  behavioural  and  structural  remedies  on  online \nplatforms and possibly other sectors. For the of this note and the formal submission to the consultation, \nthe MCA is focusing on digital platforms rather than just online platforms. In this case, digital platforms \nwould also include platforms that do not strictly provide online services, but which may still control and \ninfluence access to them (e.g. operating systems).  ","3562":"The MCA recognizes the economic benefits of digital platforms, however, it is also aware that the digital \nenvironment may indeed present scenarios where large digital platforms act as gatekeepers, given the \nstructural nature of markets where these platforms are present and their ability to implement potentially \nunfair contractual terms and unfair practices at the expense of consumers and businesses.  ","3563":"The  MCA  therefore  acknowledges  the  perceived  competition  problems  attributed  to  the  digital \nenvironment.  To  this  effect,  the  MCA  would  be  amenable  to  a  possible  new  EU  ex-ante  regulatory \nframework  for  digital  platforms,  aimed  to  address  behavioural  and  structural  concerns  that  could \npotentially be raised by large digital platforms in the digital sphere.   ","3564":"The MCA considers that the regulatory oversight of digital and online platforms should mirror the ex-ante \nregulatory  oversight  that  is  currently  in  place  for  telecoms.  This  means  that  an  ex-ante  regulatory \nframework for large digital platforms and the corresponding rationale for regulatory intervention should \nrest  on  the  well-understood  concept  of  dominance.  The  dominance  concept  is  underscored  by  the \nrequirement  on  National Regulatory  Authorities  (NRAs)  to  gather  robust  evidence  of  potential market \nfailure before actually arriving at a decision to implement ex-ante regulatory measures.   ","3565":"The dominance test needs to be well-defined, carried out within the parameters of quantifiable criteria of \nmarket power and supplemented with key indicators on aspects such as economies of scale and scope, \ndata advantages, network effects etc. These quantifiable criteria could then also set the benchmark for \nthe  implementation  of  a  general  streamlined  economic  and  competition  model  that  can  apply  across \ndifferent national or specific circumstances. Such an approach would guarantee a clearly set threshold of \nintervention that offers certainty and clarity to market players and the industry in general.  ","3566":"As for the regulatory intervention and the remedies per se, the MCA acknowledges that potentially the \nbest  option  would  entail  a  combination  of  principle-based  obligations  \/  prohibitions  and  the \nimplementation of data-driven regulatory tools. This is subject to having the necessary safeguards in place \nto ensure that regulation is only proportionally implemented where actually required.  ","3567":"On the institutional design the MCA sees the validity of having a robust coordinative effort at EU level to \naddress concerns raised by large digital platforms. In any case, EU Member States should always retain \ndiscretionary  power  to  designate  the  competent  national  regulatory  body  to  deal  with  competition \nshortcomings in the digital environment.  ","3568":"The MCA considers that a robust ex-ante regulatory framework would go a long way in addressing most \nstructural competition issues. So, it would be better that such a framework is sufficiently robust to address \nall structural competition issues, rather than setting a New Competition Tool that risks overlapping with \nthe ex-ante regulatory framework and other regulatory tools. However, the MCA does acknowledge that \nthe New Competition Tool, if implemented by competent regulatory authorities, could potentially serve \nas a safety net in exceptional cases or what may be referred to as regulatory blind spots.  In such case(s), \nutmost  attention  would  need  to  be  paid  to  potential  regulatory  overlaps,  in  order  to  avoid  legal \nuncertainty and potential negative implications for current  and future  investment. In this regard, legal \ncertainty could be achieved via the adherence to the lex specialis principle, whereby the ex-ante regulatory \nframework for any sector remains the applicable legislation to address competition and societal aspects, \nwhilst  any  form  of  New  Competition  Tool  would  serve  as  a  complementary  tool  aimed  to  address \nexceptional issues and outcomes that classify as \u2018blind spots\u2019 under sectorial regulation.  ","3569":"This argument assumes that the economic benefits from those other com-\npanies\u2019 pursuit of a dominant position (or more precisely: their incentive \nfrom the dominant company\u2019s position being unassailable by competition \nlaw) exceeds damage from the dominant position of that company which \nhas actually achieved it. When online platforms reach great importance not \nonly on their markets but for major parts of the economy, this assumption \ncould prove wrong.  ","3570":"This raises the question whether attempts to achieve a dominant position \nby means of competition should be considered harmful on the online plat-\nforms\u2019 markets. If this question is answered positively, new competition-law \ntools are necessary because the existing tools are based on traditional eco-\nnomic doctrine. They cannot prohibit or prevent pursuing a dominant posi-\ntion.  ","3571":"Aside intervention before dominance, a major hurdle in the existing toolbox \nis proving dominance. Online platforms\u2019 actions are mostly unilateral and \nthus can only be tackled by means of today\u2019s competition law if the online \nplatform is proven to be dominant in the relevant market or to transfer dom-\ninance into the relevant market. This is unsatisfactory for several reasons: \nFirst, a major online platform may use resources which are not directly re-\nlated to the concerned market. Existing competition law on dominance \nhardly can deal with that. Second, proving dominance takes great re-\nsources from competition authorities. Accordingly, it limits the number of \ncases they can handle. Third, market players often cannot prove domi-\nnance because they have no access to the required information. Therefore, \nmarket players often cannot tackle abusive conduct of online platforms by \nmeans of private enforcement.  ","3572":"Online platforms may try to make their customers dependent. A means \ncould be transferring know-how from the customer to the online platform. A \npowerful online platform may be in the position to force its customers into \naccepting that it takes over commercial decisions from the customer. When \nthe online platform takes over decision making from the customer, the \nonline platform will gain know-how. The customer, however, will lose know-\nhow. He will increasingly become dependent on the online platform\u2019s deci-\nsions. And he will be less and less able to switch to another service pro-\nvider. ","3573":" \n \n \n \n \n \n\fmake better decisions for the customers than the customers could make \nthemselves. In such cases, customers may transfer decision making volun-\ntarily to the online platform. The result is the same as above, the customer \nwill become more and more dependent on the online platform, and the \ntransfer of decision making my become irreversible.  ","3574":"This is another issue traditional economic doctrine has problems to deal \nwith. The online platform\u2019s offer to let its AI make decisions for the cus-\ntomer is an offer made subject to competition and in a market environment. \nA highly developed AI is a result of innovation competition and a product \nwhich customers choose for its superior functions. And that is in line with \nthe goals of competition policy under traditional economic doctrine. Yet, it \nmay result in irreversible dependence and a loss of competition in the long \nrun.  ","3575":"Another example for transferring know-how from the customer to the plat-\nform is taking over the purchasing process from the retailer. The platform \ngains direct access to the customer and the retailer loses it. The platform \ngets to know the customer and his habits and preferences, and the retailer \nis alienated from the customer.  ","3576":"Therefore, dominant online platforms should at least be required not to \n\u201cbundle\u201d their services with the transfer of commercial decisions and pur-\nchasing process. Users should be able to choose if they use the service \nmaking their own decisions and processing the purchase on their own or \ntransferring that to the online platform. Competition law would need appro-\npriate tools to ensure that.  ","3577":"The extreme growth of some online platforms results to a significant extent \nfrom using content of customers and third parties without remuneration. \nThe online platforms use this content for their own business purposes. \nSometimes, they even use no-cost content of customers to provide ser-\nvices to these customers\u2019 competitors. This cost-free approach makes their \nbusinesses very scalable and fuels their extreme growth.  ","3578":"One example are customers of the online marketplace Amazon who have \nto share the site for a certain product. The first customer has to furnish the \nsite with information and pictures. Another customer may join the site and \noffer a lower price; then, Amazon advertises primarily this customer\u2019s offer \non the product site. This customer can freeride on the first customer\u2019s in-\nvestment, and Amazon profits, too.  ","3579":" \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAnother example are customers of Google Shopping. They have to accept \nthat Google Shopping uses their product pictures to advertise their compet-\nitors\u2019 offers if they provide the better picture and the competitor offers a \nlower price \u2013 or, in Google Shopping\u2019s default display mode, pays Google a \nhigher price for top listing.  ","3580":"Therefore, one way to limit the power of online platforms may be prohibiting \nto tap into customers\u2019 assets without remuneration, especially where the \nplatform uses customers\u2019 assets to provide services to their competitors. \nNew rules should entitle customers to a fair remuneration. The new rules \nshould be mandatory. Else, the online platforms would use their massive \nbargaining power to exclude these rules by contract.  ","3581":"The German Economic Institute (IW) is a private economic research institute in Germany and an advocate of a liberal economic and social order. The IW has set itself the task of creating and imparting economic knowledge and thus prompting change with the clear objective of making the European economy fit for the future. \nTo this end, the researchers compile studies, deduct policy recommendations and realize projects to improve the understanding of how business and society function and interact. In that way, they contribute to sustainable growth and long-term prosperity working methodically and empirically sound and using state-of-the-art methods. The scope of IW\u2019s research is, among others, the labor market, education, demographics, real estate and financial markets, but also digitization and its consequences for the economy and society as a whole.","3582":"First of all, especially in the digital economy, also the merger control has to be considered. The reason is that most platforms wouldn't be in such a strong position and competition problems in the digital economy wouldn't be as severe if some aquisitions would have been forbidden by authorities: Facebook (instagram+WhatsApp), Microsoft (LinkedIn + GitHub), Google (Android, YouTube, DoubleClick, Waze,...), Amazon (AbeBooks, Twitch, ...). The platforms used their home market as a base to enter new markets by acquiring successful firms in new markets. Accordingly, structural competition problems are to some extent the result of mistakes in merger control. In fact, leveraging market power to new markets and acquisition of new competitors in the home or nem market could to some extent be prevented by merger control. Merger control can keep markets open and lead to the entry of new competitors, innovations and better services for customers. For example the rise of TikTok as a competitor to Facebook and YouTube shows that entry is still possible.","3583":"Concerning competition problems, there are structural problems if (i) there are high entry\/starting cost and (ii) if there is a high concentration on the market. High entry\/starting cost may be due to network effects (attract a critical mass), regulatory barriers, lack of relevant data, hard to attract users (high switching cost, single-homing consumers) and so on. From an economist's perspective high entry cost are no problem for competition, if there are multiple active enterprises in the market because competition or the implementation of standards should reduce switching cost, for example. ","3584":"Accordingly, high concentration and high entry costs reinforce each other. Once a market is concentrated and new competitors cannot enter, there can be a structural problem for competition. In the platform economy this can lead to vertical integration and the formation of proprieatary markets, where the platform shapes a business environment in their favor (also as a competitor to business users) to maximize profits. However, innovations and changes in demand can still lead to working competition.Structural competition problems arise if (i) there is only a small number of competitors (1-3) and (ii) switching for customers as well as market entry for new competitors is hard. Both conditions, (i) and (ii), must be fullfilled. Once this is fullfilled, the enterprise has market power and can distort competition. Furthermore, the enterprise with market power can use its capabilities to enter new markets or add new services. There is, however, a difference between entering new markets by acquisitions or by establishing a good or service on their own. Expanding by acquisition successful firms in targeted markets is problematic for competition because an established enterprise is bought and success is probable due to the fact that the firm is already established. The other case where services are established by own reasearch or investment is less problematic because the entering firm has to compete with established competitors and can fail (For example Google+ in social networks). ","3585":"Regarding a gatekeeper, I would not use the term \"gatekeeping scenario\" because based on this term also a supermarket or webshop that decides whether to list a product or not is in a gatekeeping scenario without having market power or being a gatekeeper. \nAccordingly, I would just aim at gatekeepers that could be defined as follows: A digital platform acts as a gatekeeper in the underlying platform ecosystem if there are very few, if any, alternative services available, and it has a large impact on the market(s) due to its durable and stable market power whereas it is highly relevant for users from all sides of the platform. The Apple App Store is such a gatekeeper for iOS Apps because there is no alternative way to download apps. In other cases finding a gatekeeper is not that easy because there are alternatives (Google play store on Android Smartphones, Facebook as network, Whatsapp as messanger) or switching is easy (Google search, YouTube). However, if there is indeed only one platform that customers and business users have to use, and, entering the market is hardly possible, there can indeed be structural competition problems. ","3586":"Especially with strong indirect network effects in combination with subadditive costs (economies of scale), one dominant player will be the result. However, there was a fierce competition in advance and there may be pressure by potential competitors. Accordingly, tipping can be problematic for competition, however, keeping markets open and enforcing merger control can prevent most negative effects on competition. ","3587":"The use of algorithms for collusion, abuse of market power or unfair rules by platforms for example, are no structural problems for competition because these topics are already covered by existing regulation (Art. 101 and Art. 102 TFEU, Regulation (EU) 2019\/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services ), shown by the investigations of the EU of Apple App Store and the lawsuits of the Bundeskartellamt against Facebook. The P2B Regulation, however, should be supported by sanctions that are the same in the whole Union (For example: Kremer and Schneider, 2020, Ein zweiter, kritischer Blick auf die P2B-Verordnung: Nachhaltige Ver\u00e4nderung des Plattform\u00f6kosystems?, in: Wettbewerb in Recht und Praxis, Vol. 66, No. 9, 1128-1137). Since the P2B regulation went into force in July 2020, the outcomes should be considered before new tools are implemented.Please see answers for 8.3This is problematic if acquisitions are used, the market power in the home market or the own platform is designed in the firm's own favor to enter new markets. The problems could in principle be tackled by merger control or Art. 102 TFEU.The Commission is already able to tackle such situations.Merger Control must also be used.App-Stores; E-Commerce; Online advertising; social NetworksAmazon if new products are sold be Amazon based on the analysis of data of third party sellers on Amazon. Google favouring own Services (Cases by Commission); Fortnite or Spotify vs. AppleDigital markets are prone to subadditive costs, that means economies of scale exist: Once a website or app is developed and established, serving new customers is easy (especially for platforms, but to some extent also for sellers of goods or services if there is no congestion or shortage in supply). This can lead to concentrated markets. Some firms may abuse this position in order to monetize this position.Competition authorities showed that they are able to tackle competition problems in digital markets: Investigations by Commission or national antitrust authorities. \nFurthermore, easy market entry or low switching costs or multi-homing customers restrict market power of dominant firms. So called leap frog competition can also drive monopolistic firms out of the market very quickly: Yahoo!; rise of TikTok; myspaceCommission and competition authorities have the means to already address problem and already showed that they can (for example fines levied on Alphabet\/Google in antitrust cases)Merger control is also very important.","3588":"Commission already has the means to act. In Germany, furthermore, gasoline station market is very oligopolistic. However, more transparency by an app by the german antitrust authority lead to more competition.Court Case: EuGH, 2016, Urteil in der Rechtssache C-74\/14, Eturas, Vorabentscheidung gem\u00e4\u00df Art. 267 AEUV zum Ersuchen vom Lietuvos vyriausiasis administracinis teismas, LuxemburgThe case of gas stations in Germany showed that tackling such situations is possible. New digital technologies can increase transparency on price setting on such markets, for example, and antitrust authorities can use these means to detect collusion. Accordingly, tacit collusion should not be problematic. National antitrust authorities already got more power: Richtlinie (EU) 2019\/1 which is implemented at the moment.","3589":"collusion leads to less inovations and\/or higher pricesCommission and national authorities can already tackle such problems.Commission, Courts and national authorities showed that they can solve such problems. The only problematic case can be that an algorithm on its own can collude, altough, collussion was excluded or believed to be excluded when algorithm was implemented. Accordingly, who is to blame for the behavior of machines: An assessment is necessary; i.e. is the implementor to blame and what he has to do for not being responsible.Shopping platforms; app stores; social networks; food delivery (for example delivery hero); mobile payment; advertising supported video on demand. Recomendation of restaurants, sharing platforms, accomodation platforms, homesharing platformsPositive indirect network effects are the most important feature for digital platforms: Platforms facilitate transactions between users, normally from different user groups or platform sides, and this only works if they want to actually be matched. ","3590":"Subadditive cost functions (economies of scale) can also lead to monoplization. Accordingly, economies of scale and indirect Network effects lead to dominant market Players. However, also new competitors with better products or services can use these opportunities (For example TikTok).Economies of scale and network effects foster growth on digital markets if the business model is asset-light, i.e. just transactions are facilitated.There was a fierce competition before tipping a winner survices. There must be reason for this victory (better products or Service for example) and it is hard to imagine that success should be punished. But market power could have negative consequences for competition, however, these can be tackled using existing regulations. Furthermore, leap-frog competition on digital markets can very quickly erode dominant positions. Accordingly, enforcing regulation and keeping markets open (less regulation, digital single market, R&D friendly environment) and enforcement of merger control are cruicial.Commission already has the means to set rules and stob abusive behavior. Also, ex-ante, it is not clear who will win.Merger control and business\/regulatory environment are also important.If there are alternatives and one firm is not dominant, there is no gatekeeper. Gatekeeping also refers to interaction of more than one user group. Accordingly, this can normally restrict to platforms. A definition for a gatekeeper could be: A digital platform acts as a gatekeeper in the underlying platform ecosystem if there are very few, if any, alternative services available, and it has a large impact on the market(s) due to its durable and stable market power whereas it is highly relevant for users from all sides of the platform. ","3591":"Only without alternatives and with hardly possible market entry, there could be gatekeepers. Such cases, however, are covered by Art. 102 TFEU.Retail for example: Which product to add. Network sectors (natural Gases for example): Which customer to serve or add to the network. All situation, however, can be covered by Art. 102 TFEU or sector specific regulation.Please see 18.4Customers don't have alternatives and business users have to use the platform to reach customers. Furthermore, this position is safeguarded by differentiated treatment by the platform (favouring own products, favoring some business users). Accordingly, customers that cannot switch lead business users that must use the platform. These conditions then give power to the platform to shape the environment in its own favor.Regarding a gatekeeper, I would not use the term \"gatekeeping scenario\" because based own this term also a supermarket or webshop that decides whether to list a product or not is in a gatekeeping scenario without having market power or being a gatekeeper. \nAccordingly, I would just aim at gatekkepers that could be defined as follows: A digital platform acts as a gatekeeper in the underlying platform ecosystem if there are very few, if any, alternative services available, and it has a large impact on the market(s) due to its durable and stable market power whereas it is highly relevant for users from all sides of the platform. In such a case, however, Art. 102 TFEU applies.In combination with Merger Control.

Furthermore, P2B regulation just went into force and Richtlinie (EU) 2019\/1 applies; there also some ongoing lawsuits. The consequences of this regulations and lawsuits should be considered before implementing a new tool.Existing rules and regulation are sufficient to tackle competition problems. Antitrust regulation has general rules that can be adopted to new developments in the economy. A competition tool that can be used without an infringement is highly problematic: Punishing without infringement is problematic from a lawyers perspective. Economically, such a tool could, furthermore, lead to inconsistencies (comparable enterprises can be treated differently), are prone to corruption and market planing.Tool is unnecessary","3592":"Tool is not necessaryTool is not necessaryTool is not necessaryTool is not necessaryTool is not necessaryTool is not necessaryEnforcement of merger control and Art. 101 and Art. 102 should be sufficient.

(ii) Does the design improve quality and benefit consumers (and has the\ncompany conducted testing to evidence the quality improvement)? (iii) Is the design a\nseparate product, or part of the main product offered to consumers?

Examples of conduct where such treatment may be appropriate, as they do\nnot appear to have any pro-competitive rationale, may include product degradation\n(predatory innovation, such as in\u200b \u200bDecca Navigator System\u200b).\u00a0","3619":"\u25cf The imposition of unfair business practices by dominant firms is expressly\nin respect of platforms (and\nprohibited by Article 102(a) TFEU, and,\nirrespective of dominance) is addressed by the recent P2B Regulation.

In particular, we would caution against defining\n\u2018unfairness\u2019\nin a way that discourages innovation aimed at improving user experience,\nwhich can lead to a stronger market position.

Also, there may be gatekeepers in\nmarkets such as electronic communications, and more traditional essential facilities (e.g.\nports). Thus depending on the definition adopted, gatekeepers may not be limited to the\ndigital sector.\u00a0","3650":"Each of the factors posited by the Commission in Qs 18.7 and 18.9 may be relevant to\nvarying degrees in a particular industry, and this may change over time. In a recent Deloitte\nreport\u200b, one EU developer described app platforms as offering \u201cgreat opportunities, a\nfantastic medium\u201d for developers. As such a case-by-case analysis is required to identify\nwhich companies may qualify as a gatekeeper in a particular market, and whether their role\nas a gatekeeper gives rise to any potential competition problems.\u00a0\u00a0","3651":"the Commission identifies competition concerns relating to\nTo the extent\ngatekeepers, then we acknowledge that there may be an enforcement gap with respect to\nexisting competition law tools. Notably, in the context of Article 101 there may not be a\nrelevant agreement \/ concerted practice; and in the context of Article 102 either the\ngatekeeper may not be dominant, or the behaviour at issue may not be an abuse. Thus\nthere may be a case for the Commission to intervene where it identifies competition\nconcerns arising from a firm being a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0","3652":"As we identified in our response to the IIA and expanded upon in our response to the\nDigital Services Act consultation in respect of the proposed gatekeeper regulation, the\nsolution to the \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 concerns may comprise a package of complementary\nreforms. New regulations could address issues that fall outside the scope of competition\nlaw, but which are important for digital markets to function in a fair, efficient manner (e.g.,\nensuring data portability, appropriate levels of transparency, and fairness in contractual\nrelations).\nIt appears to us at this initial stage that some of these measures could be\nimportant whatever the size or market position of the digital platform at issue. Similarly, as\none looks back at the unpredictable nature of historic innovation and tries to imagine what\nkinds of digital products and services European consumers will be using in the future, it\nseems reasonable to assume that notions of \u2018gatekeeper\u2019, \u2018platform\u2019, and even \u2018digital\u2019 will\nneed to be robust and flexible. The NCT could have a valuable role in any such package of\nreforms, enabling evidence based case-by-case assessment where the object of the\nCommission\u2019s concerns falls outside the scope of existing (or future) \u200bex ante\u200b regulation.\u00a0\u00a0","3653":"\u25cf There may be areas where anti-competitive effects result from practices or\nmarket scenarios which cannot be effectively addressed by the existing EU\ncompetition legislation.

As such, should the Commission\npropose a narrow NCT, for example limited to digital markets, it should enunciate clearly\nthe basis on the reasons for excluding certain sectors, and consider carefully whether this\nundermines the universal application of competition law.\u00a0","3656":"We note in this regard comments by Executive Vice President Vestager in a recent speech:\n\u201cMany of the biggest issues that this tool could help us resolve are linked to digital markets.\nBut I doubt that it would make sense to apply it only to these markets \u2013 instead of covering\nthe whole economy, as our existing competition powers do. That\u2019s partly because the sort\nof issues I\u2019ve discussed come up in many other markets as well. In fact, the Greek, Icelandic\nand British competition authorities have so far only used this type of power in markets that\naren\u2019t digital. It\u2019s also because the digital transition is affecting pretty much every industry\nthere is. So it\u2019s hard to draw the line between what\u2019s digital and what isn\u2019t \u2013 especially when\nyou consider that the rules we come up with now should be ready for the future, when that\nline may get even more blurred.\u201d EVP Vestager has also commented that \u200b\u201cNeutrality is a\nguiding principle of everything we do. When we take our decisions, we have to follow\nwhere the evidence and law lead us, and treat every business the same. However big or\nsmall they are, and wherever they come from\u201d\u200b.","3657":"We agree that on the basis of the concerns identified by the Commission there may be\nopportunities to modernise the EU competition law framework. However in some\ninstances where existing competition law may be the appropriate tool. The Commission\u2019s\nassessment of which tool to use to address a particular problem in a particular sector\nwould require an evidence based, case-by-case assessment, and therefore the legislator\nshould be cautious of legislating in advance to limit a particular tool to markets\/ sectors\nwith particular characteristics.\u00a0","3658":"Several of the proposals that are now under consideration by the Commission have the\npotential to promote competition and innovation in the EEA. For example, we have long\nsupported enhanced data portability, which facilitates switching, multi-homing, and\nprovides opportunities for new players to enter or expand in digital markets. Providing\nbetter access to aggregated datasets could benefit research and development in a range\nof industries while also safeguarding user data privacy.\u00a0\u00a0","3659":"The contemplated NCT could provide a useful way of better understanding markets,\nincluding through any framework for more advanced evidence-gathering and analysis, and\naddressing any market failures using flexible and creative remedies.

For example, integration between different products or services can promote\nor restrict competition. Our experience has been that telling the difference often requires\na detailed, case-by-case and fact-based assessment of the effects on consumer welfare.\nIt may, therefore, make more sense to adapt existing antitrust tools and procedures to\nallow assessments to be carried out more swiftly and effectively. This could be achieved,\nfor example, through organisational and procedural changes that enable more efficient\n(and shorter) proceedings, and by setting up specialised teams with the expertise to\nassess complex technical matters.

This makes the NCT the correct tool to conduct an assessment of markets where\nthere is a structural \u200brisk to competition, as it can consider the evidence on a case-by-case\nbasis before making \u200bex ante \u200binterventions to avoid structural risks to competition\nmaterialising into a structural lack of competition.\u00a0\u00a0","3666":"We discuss the remedies framework further below but we note here that \u200bex ante\nintervention to address structural risks to competition should be accompanied by a\nsuitable remedies framework which allows measures which steer market developments\naway from competition issues towards a more competitive outcome.

Thus what may be important for competition in one market may not be\nimportant for competition in another market. As such, flexibility and future proofing will be\nimportant considerations in the design of a NCT.\u00a0","3669":"In terms of whether the NCT should be limited to dominant companies only, we note\nExecutive Vice President Vestager\u2019s comments that \u200b\u201cThe rules we have today can\u2019t stop\nbig companies from pushing markets towards the tipping point, unless those companies\nare already dominant in a market. And that isn\u2019t just an issue in digital markets.

By contrast, a\ngenerally applicable NCT could provide the Commission with sufficient flexibility to\naddress structural and other competition-related issues.\u00a0","3671":"In terms of how the NCT would interact with a range of existing rules and regulations, we\nnote that minimising duplication between different legislation is important so as to\nenhance legal certainty.

The CMA proposed this remedy following the passage\nof the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) but before the deadline for its domestic\nimplementation. PSD2 contains certain requirements which overlap with the Open Banking\nremedy, requiring banks to give access to customer financial data to third party payment\nproviders (with customer consent). To ensure the coherent adoption of these two regimes,\nthe CMA proposed that the Open Banking \u2018\u200bImplementation Entity\u2019 \u200balso have a role in\nadministering PSD2. The CMA also viewed the Open Banking remedy as complementing\nPSD2 in other ways, e.g. the API required by Open Banking could also be used to comply\nwith PSD2.\u00a0","3676":"The NCT potentially applies to a broad range of market sectors and a broad range of\npotential concerns. Further, as set out in response to Qs 27 and 28 above, Google would\nsupport the NCT being adopted in the broadest form proposed by the Commission,\napplying to all sectors of the economy and all markets in which structural competition\nproblems may be present, without requiring dominance as a threshold for intervention.\u00a0\u00a0","3677":"Against that background, we support inclusion in the legislation of each of the four options\nposited by the Commission in Q30, and, within the Commission\u2019s ability to impose\nremedies, the three options posited in Q31. An appropriate range of remedial tools is\nimportant to ensuring that the remedy framework can effectively address structural\ncompetition problems whilst also preserving existing market dynamics that do not\ncontribute to those problems, as we set out in our response to the IIA. I.e. in designing the\nremedies framework the Commission should be guided by the principles of effectiveness,\nproportionality and flexibility.\u00a0\u00a0","3678":"As we explained in our response to the IIA, an important issue the Commission should\nconsider when designing the provisions which will permit it to impose remedies is the legal\ntest and evidentiary standard that will apply. When imposing remedies, precedents exist in\na number of regimes, for example the \u2018Adverse Effect on Competition\u2019 test applicable in\nto Effective\nthe UK market\nCompetition\u2019 test in the EU Merger Regulation. Both of these examples carry extensive\njurisprudence on both the legal test and the associated evidentiary standard. Google\nwould also support the adoption of flexible standards, with higher standards applicable for\nstricter or more interventionist remedies.\u00a0","3679":"Whilst we support the NCT being supported by a broad range of remedial tools, we\nconsider that it is important that those tools are utilised within the correct confines. Part of\nthis is satisfying the appropriate legal test as we note above. In addition, the Commission\nshould not use the NCT to introduce remedies (or a series of remedies) that better fall\nwithin the purview of new legislation following the appropriate legislative procedure.\nSeeking to address through antitrust enforcement matters which are better dealt with\nthrough legislation can produce potentially prolonged periods of legal uncertainty and\npoor outcomes.","3680":"Structural remedies are potentially highly draconian and risk significant adverse effects on\nincentives to invest and attendant chilling effects on innovation. They also risk unintended\nconsequences and potentially adverse future market developments (i.e. they risk\n32\n\u201c\u200bthrowing the baby out with the bathwater\u200b\u201d ). This is particularly so in rapidly developing\nsectors, as for example \u2018digitised\u2019 sectors typically are. If the target of a structural remedy\nis not sufficiently stable, implementing it may carry costs that outweigh any benefits of\nintervention.\u00a0","3681":"Accordingly, the imposition of structural remedies should be subject to a suitably high\nlegal threshold and evidentiary burden. The Commission should proceed cautiously, only\nimposing structural remedies where it is satisfied that intervention is justified and no other\nsolution is available (including where appropriate pursuing other, less intrusive, remedial\nmeasures first as outlined above).\u00a0\u00a0","3682":"By way of illustration, in its market study into \u200bonline platforms and digital advertising\u200b, the\nCMA discussed whether it would be appropriate to adopt certain structural remedies in\nrespect of Google\u2019s activities in open display advertising (specifically \u2018separation\u2019\nremedies: namely divestiture, operational separation or specific restrictions targeted at\nconflicts of interest). The CMA ultimately concluded that it would not be appropriate to\nseek to impose any \u2018separation\u2019 remedies, but that it would recommend that these powers\nbe made available to the new Digital Markets Unit (DMU). Two main factors drove this\nconclusion.\u00a0\u00a0","3683":"\u25cf First\u200b, the CMA emphasised the need for further analysis and investigation, stating\nthat when considering the use of its separation powers it would be incumbent upon\nthe DMU to \u201c\u200bassess whether operational separate is sufficient, and if not, consider\nownership separation, balancing the costs of intervention with the benefits for\nconsumers through innovation and more effective competition\u200b\u201d. I.e. there are at\nleast two questions that should be asked before structural measures are imposed:\n(1) is any less intrusive measure effective; and (2) if not, is a structural measure\nproportionate.\u00a0\u00a0","3684":"\u25cf Second\u200b, the CMA noted that the relevant products and technology are \u201c\u200blikely to\nchange over time, and therefore the effectiveness of an \u2018one-off\u2019 intervention to\nseparate current activities is likely to be time-limited\u200b\u201d. I.e., particularly in dynamic\nand fast moving markets, caution should be exercised before imposing structural\nremedies given the increased difficulty in later reversing or adapting remedies to\ntake account of market developments.\u00a0\u00a0","3685":"\u25cf First\u200b, CMA market investigation decisions are taken by members of a panel of\nindependently appointed decision makers. Panel members are not formally\naffiliated with the CMA and are not, for example, involved in forming the CMA\u2019s\npolicy objectives. This structure provides an insulation from factors external to\nspecific cases (e.g. political factors) thereby acting as a safeguard for relevant\nundertakings. Replicating this structure is not possible within the institutional\nframework of the Commission and therefore it cannot be assumed that it is\nappropriate for the Commission to fully replicate the powers available to the CMA\nunless it can also implement additional procedural safeguards to compensate for\nthis institutional safeguard which cannot be recreated.\u00a0","3686":"\u25cf Second\u200b, not only is the imposition of structural remedies following a CMA market\ninvestigation rare, but the cases are highly fact specific. For instance, the CMA\nimposed a package of divestment remedies following its \u200bmarket investigation into\nUK airports\u200b, requiring BAA plc to sell a number of London and Scotland based\nairports. However,\nit is important to note that BAA plc was a product of\nprivatisation and was formerly the state owned British Airports Authority. It was not\na company which had grown from the ground up as a commercial entity through\ninvestment and innovation. The CMA did not, therefore, have to grapple with the\ncomplex issues regarding the risk of chilling effects on innovation and investment\nthat it would face outside of that narrow case specific context. If the Commission\ndoes incorporate the power for structural remedies within the NCT, it will be vital to\nassess in depth the case-specific implications of any single decision, while adhering\nto fundamental principles of only employing such remedies in a sparing and\nproportionate way, on the basis of robust evidence.\u00a0\u00a0","3687":"The result of the broad scope of the NCT, is that it would be applicable to a potentially very\nbroad range of structural competition problems. One virtue of a properly designed and\nimplemented NCT is that it will allow evidence driven case-by-case assessments of\npotential structural competition problems and the measures, if any, required to remedy\nsuch problems which may include, as a measure of last resort, structural remedies. We\naccordingly caution against seeking to identify at the outset potential candidates for the\nimposition of structural remedies.\u00a0\u00a0","3688":"involve the Commission considering how to readily permit revision or\nPart of this will\nrevocation of remedies. As we noted in response to the IIA, this will be of particular\nimportance in dynamic markets where market developments may render remedial\nlikely be scenarios where it is\nmeasures no longer appropriate.\nappropriate for the Commission to introduce remedies on a phased basis, beginning with\nthe least intrusive measures and giving such measures adequate opportunities to deliver\ncompetitive change before introducing further measures.\u00a0","3689":"For instance, \u200bin respect of its market study into online platforms and digital advertising\n(8.21-8.48), the UK CMA proposed a package of remedies intended to decrease perceived\nbarriers to entry and expansion in the supply of general search services. The CMA\u2019s\nproposed package of remedies includes measures which vary in the impact they will have\non competition and the immediacy of that impact on the one hand, and in their degree of\nintrusiveness and the attendant costs to relevant undertakings on the other.\u00a0 \u00a0","3690":"Recognising the need to strike the balance between these concerns, the CMA proposed\nthat the initial package of interventions in respect of general search should focus on a\nnumber of less interventionist measures adopting an \u201c\u200biterative approach to testing and\ntrailing\u200b\u201d remedies before considering more interventionist measures. The CMA noted that\nsuccessful implementation of less intrusive interventions may obviate the need for more\nintrusive measures; or, conversely, may confirm that such measures are required.\u00a0\u00a0","3691":"In striking this balance, the CMA expressly avoided creating a chilling effect on innovation.\nThe CMA observed that \u201c\u200bthe impact of this intervention of dynamic incentives needs to be\ngiven careful consideration\u200b\u201d. The CMA then discounted certain particularly intrusive\nmeasures which ran \u201c\u200bexcessive risks to innovation\u200b\u201d. One remedy it considered was\nrequiring Google to share \u2018click and query\u2019 data with search competitors. That remedy\ncould discourage innovation by encouraging third-parties to replicate the results that we\nshow, which would lead to lower quality services for users by reducing incentives for\nsearch engines to innovate and improve algorithms. The CMA acknowledged \u200bfurther work\nwas required to \u201c\u200bconsider how this intervention could be designed in a manner that\nenhances incentives to innovate\u200b\u201d.\u00a0","3692":"A staged approach to remedy implementation is just one way the Commission can ensure\nthat the appropriate balance is struck between addressing potential concerns and\npreserving existing market dynamics which do not contribute to these concerns. We\nacknowledge it may not be appropriate in all circumstances, particularly where prompt\naction may be needed. However, it does illustrate the value in a broad range of remedial\noptions, and the valuable flexibility in approach that would be lost if the legislation is cast\nnarrowly.\u00a0\u00a0","3693":"As we set out in our response to the IIA, rather than adopting an ex ante regulatory\nframework, it may be more appropriate to adapt existing antitrust tools and procedures to\nallow assessments to be carried out more swiftly and effectively. We suggested that one\nelement of this may be fortifying antitrust investigations by the targeted use of interim\nmeasures only for obvious and egregious abuses that cause serious and irreparable harm.\n\u00a034","3694":"In designing an interim measures regime, we encourage the Commission to have regard to\nthe same overall\n\u200bi.e. flexibility,\neffectiveness and proportionality. Particularly, for interim measures it will be important to\nensure that measures are withdrawn when no longer necessary, or where the burden of\nhaving them in place outweighs their benefits.\u00a0","3695":"Google supports enabling the Commission to accept voluntary remedies, as is the case in\nits Article 101\/102 investigations,\nincluding at different stages of the process (analogous\nto offering commitments to avoid a reference to Phase 2 in merger control, or the\n\u2018undertakings in lieu\u2019 in the UK market investigation regime). This would ensure flexibility\nand proportionality in the regime.","3696":"We also suggested other fortifying measures, where needed: well-designed remedies;\nintervention against\nspecific, harmful forms of self-preferencing (complemented by updated guidance); and use of a new tool along the\nlines of the proposed NCT. A further example we provided was for organisational and procedural changes that\nenable more efficient (and shorter) proceedings, and the setting up specialised teams with the expertise to assess\ncomplex technical matters.\u00a0","3697":"See also Jean Tirole \u201cWe must develop what I would call \u201cparticipative antitrust,\u201d in which the industry or other\nparties propose possible regulations and the antitrust authorities issue some opinion, creating some legal certainty\nwithout casting the rules in stone\u201d.

Further, adopting such powers into the NCT would enable to import\nthe experience, guidance and jurisprudence it has developed using such powers into its\nuse of the new tool.\u00a0","3700":"The existing European Union competition laws contain robust procedural safeguards to\nensure the rights of defence of undertakings concerned and encourage high quality\ndecision making. This practice, supported by the robust judicial review of the European\nCourts,\nis an important part of ensuring the Commission\u2019s status as a leading global\ncompetition enforcer. In designing the NCT, the Commission should have regard to how it\ncan ensure consistency with that regulatory tradition.\u00a0\u00a0","3701":"The nature of procedural safeguards necessary will depend on the scope of application of\nthe proposed NCT. Assuming that the Commission would have the power to impose\ninterventionist remedies at the end of its proceedings, the rights of entities subject to\nthose proceedings should be akin to those in Regulation 1\/2003 for Article 101\/102\ninvestigations (which also brings with it related experience, guidance and jurisprudence).\u00a0\u00a0","3702":"Another essential part of the European competition law regulatory tradition is proper\njudicial oversight. For this to be effective,\nit requires clearly defined legal tests and\nevidential standards so that\nthe Commission\u2019s decision making can be properly\nscrutinised. Therefore it is important that these are detailed in the legislation. As we noted\nin our response to the IIA, when it comes to the imposition of remedies, examples of\npotential precedents include the \u2018Adverse Effect on Competition\u2019 test applicable in the UK\nmarket investigation regime, or the \u2018Significant Impediment to Effective Competition\u2019 test\nin the EU Merger Regulation.

A\ngatekeeper may not necessarily be 'dominant' within the meaning of Article 102 of the EU\nTreaty.\u00a0","3748":"The Commission appears to consider gatekeepers as large online platforms driven by strong\neconomies of scale and direct and indirect network effects who increasingly act as private\ngatekeepers to critical online activities for an exceptionally large population of private and\nbusiness users. As explained further in our response to the consultation on the proposed\nGatekeeper Regulation, identifying which firms qualify as gatekeepers is a complex exercise\nthat requires further analysis.\u00a0\u00a0","3749":"The advantage of the NCT, as the Commission appears to envisage it, is that it would be\nflexible enough to investigate competition concerns in a market without needing to label a\nsubset of platforms as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019. As we noted in our response to the IIA, if the threshold in,\nfor example an ex ante regulation, is that a platform is a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019, then the Commission\nwould need to consider carefully how to define \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 platforms in a clear and certain\nway that is sufficiently future-proof.\u00a0","3750":"The Commission\u2019s concern in the digital sector appears to relate to \u201c\u200bsome large online\nplatforms benefitting from significant network effects and acting as gatekeepers\u200b\u201d.\nNevertheless, the relevance of network effects, other factors, and countervailing factors\n(multi-homing etc.), varies between markets, and therefore it would be difficult to characterise\ngatekeeper scenarios as \u201ccommon\u201d in digital sectors\/markets. The Commission should also be\ncautious in condemning network effects, which can create virtuous cycles and encourage\nin certain\npro-competitive behaviour by the platform on both sides of the market\ncircumstances. A case-by-case assessment is needed to identify a gatekeeper, its ability and\nincentives negatively to affect competition, and pro-competitive benefits. App platforms, for\nexample, though characterised by some as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019, have been widely recognised as\ndriving innovation and growth in the app economy.\u00a0\u00a0","3751":"The Commission\u2019s approach to gatekeepers appears to date to be focused on \u201conline\nplatforms\u201d and thus to that extent the gatekeeper scenarios posited by the Commission occur\nin digital markets. However we note that one side of a digital platform may be retail, with digital\nbeing only one channel in a wider market(s). Also, there may be gatekeepers in markets such as\nelectronic communications, and more traditional essential facilities (e.g. ports). Thus\ndepending on the definition adopted, gatekeepers may not be limited to the digital sector.\u00a0","3752":"Each of the factors posited by the Commission in Q18.9 may be relevant to varying degrees in\na particular industry, and this may change over time. In a recent Deloitte \u200breport\u200b, one EU\ndeveloper described app platforms as offering \u201cgreat opportunities, a fantastic medium\u201d for\ndevelopers. As such a case-by-case analysis is required to identify whether an undertaking\u2019s\nrole as a gatekeeper gives rise to any potential competition problems.\u00a0\u00a0","3753":"Further, we note that the mere presence of a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 does not necessarily give rise to\ncompetition concerns and may generate pro-competitive effects, which would need to be\ntaken into account in any analysis of the effect on competition. For example, whilst some may\nlabel Google, Apple, Facebook, and\/or Amazon as gatekeeper platforms, as we noted in our\nresponse to the IIA these four companies are reported to be some of the largest investors in\nR&D, as reflected in the 2018 Global Innovation 1000 study. Google has consistently spent over\n15% of its revenues on R&D since 2016.

New regulations\ncould address issues that fall outside the scope of competition law, but which are important for\ndigital markets to function in a fair, efficient manner (e.g., ensuring data portability, appropriate\nlevels of transparency, and fairness in contractual relations). It appears to us at this initial stage\nthat some of these measures could be important whatever the size or market position of the\ndigital platform at issue. Similarly, as one looks back at the unpredictable nature of historic\ninnovation and tries to imagine what kinds of digital products and services European\nconsumers will be using in the future,\nit seems reasonable to assume that notions of\n\u2018gatekeeper\u2019, \u2018platform\u2019, and even \u2018digital\u2019 will need to be robust and flexible.

But\nI doubt that it would make sense to apply it only to these markets \u2013 instead of covering the\nwhole economy, as our existing competition powers do. That\u2019s partly because the sort of issues\nI\u2019ve discussed come up in many other markets as well. In fact, the Greek, Icelandic and British\ncompetition authorities have so far only used this type of power in markets that aren\u2019t digital.\nIt\u2019s also because the digital transition is affecting pretty much every industry there is.

This is particularly so in rapidly developing sectors, as for\nexample \u2018digitised\u2019 sectors typically are. If the target of a structural remedy is not sufficiently\nstable, implementing it may carry costs that outweigh any benefits of intervention.\u00a0","3783":"Accordingly, the imposition of structural remedies should be subject to a suitably high legal\nthreshold and evidentiary burden. The Commission should proceed cautiously, only imposing\nstructural remedies where it is satisfied that intervention is justified and no other solution is\navailable (including where appropriate pursuing other, less intrusive, remedial measures first as\noutlined above).\u00a0\u00a0","3784":"Part of this will\ninvolve the Commission considering how to readily permit revision or\nrevocation of remedies. As we noted in response to the IIA, this will be of particular importance\nin dynamic markets where market developments may render remedial measures no longer\nappropriate.\nlikely be scenarios where it is appropriate for the\nCommission to introduce remedies on a phased basis, beginning with the least intrusive\nmeasures and giving such measures adequate opportunities to deliver competitive change\nbefore introducing further measures.\u00a0","3785":"A staged approach to remedy implementation is just one way the Commission can ensure that\nthe appropriate balance is struck between addressing potential concerns and preserving\nexisting market dynamics which do not contribute to these concerns. We acknowledge it may\nnot be appropriate in all circumstances, particularly where prompt action may be needed.\nHowever, it does illustrate the value in a broad range of remedial options, and the valuable\nflexibility in approach that would be lost if the legislation is cast narrowly.\u00a0","3786":"The result of the broad scope of the NCT, is that it would be applicable to a potentially very\nbroad range of structural competition problems. One virtue of a properly designed and\nimplemented NCT is that it will allow evidence driven case-by-case assessments of potential\nstructural competition problems and the measures, if any, required to remedy such problems\nwhich may include, as a measure of last resort, structural remedies. We accordingly caution\nagainst seeking to identify at the outset potential candidates for the imposition of structural\nremedies.\u00a0","3787":"In principle these information gathering powers should match those that the Commission has\nin the context of antitrust (including its existing powers in relation to sector enquiries) \/ merger\ninvestigations. Further, adopting such powers into the NCT would enable to import the\nexperience, guidance and jurisprudence it has developed using such powers into its use of the\nnew tool.\u00a0","3788":"As we set out in our response to the IIA, rather than adopting an ex ante regulatory framework,\nit may be more appropriate to adapt existing antitrust tools and procedures to allow\nassessments to be carried out more swiftly and effectively. We suggested that one element of\nthis may be fortifying antitrust investigations by the targeted use of interim measures only for\nobvious and egregious abuses that cause serious and irreparable harm. We also suggested\nintervention against\nother fortifying measures, where needed: well-designed remedies;\nspecific, harmful forms of self-preferencing (complemented by updated guidance); and use of\na new tool along the lines of the proposed NCT. A further example we provided was for\norganisational and procedural changes that enable more efficient (and shorter) proceedings,\nand the setting up specialised teams with the expertise to assess complex technical matters.\u00a0","3789":"In designing an interim measures regime, we encourage the Commission to have regard to the\nsame overall factors as we suggest for the remedies regime, i.e. flexibility, effectiveness and\nproportionality. Particularly, for interim measures it will be important to ensure that measures\nare withdrawn when no longer necessary, or where the burden of having them in place\noutweighs their benefits.\u00a0","3790":"The existing European Union competition laws contain robust procedural safeguards to ensure\nthe rights of defence of undertakings concerned and encourage high quality decision making.\nThis practice, supported by the robust judicial review of the European Courts, is an important\npart of ensuring the Commission\u2019s status as a leading global competition enforcer. In designing\nthe NCT, the Commission should have regard to how it can ensure consistency with that\nregulatory tradition.\u00a0\u00a0","3791":"The nature of procedural safeguards necessary will depend on the scope of application of the\nproposed NCT. Assuming that the Commission would have the power to impose interventionist\nremedies at the end of its proceedings, the rights of entities subject to those proceedings\nshould be akin to those in Regulation 1\/2003 for Article 101\/102 investigations (which also brings\nwith it related experience, guidance and jurisprudence).\u00a0\u00a0","3792":"The right to be heard and access to file are essential, especially for undertakings to whom\nremedies may apply. As with Article 101\/102 investigations, this would therefore include the\nright to comment on the Commission\u2019s findings prior to the final decision, and to comment on\nthe appropriateness and proportionality of the envisaged remedies, to respect the right to be\nheard.\u00a0\u00a0","3793":"Another essential part of the European competition law regulatory tradition is proper judicial\noversight. For this to be effective,\nit requires clearly defined legal tests and evidential\nstandards so that the Commission\u2019s decision making can be properly scrutinised. Therefore it\nis important that these are detailed in the legislation. As we noted in our response to the IIA,\nwhen it comes to the imposition of remedies, examples of potential precedents include the\n\u2018Adverse Effect on Competition\u2019 test applicable in the UK market investigation regime, or the\n\u2018Significant Impediment to Effective Competition\u2019 test in the EU Merger Regulation. There is\nextensive jurisprudence in respect of each of these tests which could inform the design of the\napplicable legal threshold for imposing remedies under the NCT.\u00a0\u00a0","3794":"40.

The FTAO believes that a new tool would be a very appropriate extension of existing ex post and ex ante tools of market intervention in the agricultural products supply chain is because of that sector\u2019s unique structural characteristics, including:  ","3802":"Concentrated markets\nConcentration of power in agricultural chains is widespread among input suppliers, traders, branded manufacturers and retailers. This impacts individual companies in the supply chain to an extent that presents a structural competition issue. The power gained by large buyers leads to a situation in which they control suppliers up to the production stage, far removed from the model of perfectly competitive markets. \nThe contract terms for smaller producers have deteriorated, while the gap between producer prices and retail prices has grown; workers\u2019 conditions have degraded; and smaller-scale farmers are finding themselves increasingly excluded from higher value markets. These trends are accelerating transformations in rural societies and the way rural people are making a living: restructuring of agri-food and land markets, rural exodus, labour shortages. These developments are also associated with growing environmental burdens that undermine the sustainability of food production in many regions, because of land and water scarcity and climate-change yield losses.\nOnly the larger players are able to impose the above mentioned abusive terms of trade, which leads to further concentration of the market, and further concentration of buyer power. This can result in structural competition problems which can have negative effect for consumers, specially in the long term, as producers (specially smaller ones) suffer the impact of excessive buyer power and end up but not being able to survive, decreasing consequently the variety and quality of products in the market.","3803":"Vertical concentration\nIn some cases, this vertical integration offers an advantage to the largest players in the market that can be the source of structural competition problems, many of these problems occur also in cases which would not formally qualify as vertical integration, but in which downstream actors have a high degree of control over upstream ones. This is the case in agri-food supply chains.  The EU consumers would benefit from having a tool complementary to competition law that would be able to break up the chain when vertical concentration allows some players to abuse their position. \nBanana example: The banana chain is typical of the hierarchy model where multinational companies have vertically integrated all operations along the supply chain, from the production stage (through ownership of plantations) down to distribution channels (small shops, retailers and ultimately the consumers) in order to control the offer and influence the downstream market. The development of the banana into a major worldwide trade commodity has its roots in the 19th century. Given the perishable nature of the banana, its trade has been historically dominated by vertically integrated companies that controlled production, packing, shipping, import and (sometimes) ripening.","3804":"Information asymmetry \nAs the complexity of the value chain augments, the information asymmetry on the customers side is also accentuated (ie. it is each time more difficult for costumers to obtain trustworthy information about the goods they are purchasing, particularity when it comes to the environmental and social conditions in which they have been produced). The textile value chain is one of the examples of this situation. \nThis can result in a structural problem to competition as only some players (the largest ones) have, or can obtain, all the information about the environmental and social conditions along the value chain. The proposed complementary tool shall offer the Commission a way to expand its consumer protection powers, in particular through imposing measures obligating companies to provide consumers with information (eg. information on social and environmental practices up the value chain). ","3805":"Obstacles to switching from one platform to another\nThe acute imbalance of power between supermarkets\/retailers on the one side and producers on the other means that producers who sell their product to a certain buyer have serious impediments to choose to switch to a different one. This poses a problem to competition that the current competition law framework is not fit to address.","3806":"Financial strengths\nThe existing competition rules are not suitable and sufficiently effective instruments to address the power asymmetry arising from market actors having a dominant financial strength.The  growing concentration of agri-chemical market and the interlinkage between pesticide suppliers and seeds suppliers offers an example of potential structural problems \nConcentration of power in agricultural chains is widespread among input suppliers, traders, branded manufacturers and retailers. The power gained by large buyers leads to a situation in which their suppliers are de facto forced to accept the contract terms as proposed by these buyers.   \nThe contract terms for smaller producers have deteriorated, while the gap between producer prices and retail prices has grown; workers\u2019 conditions have degraded; and smaller-scale farmers are finding themselves increasingly excluded from higher value markets. These trends are accelerating transformations in rural societies and the way rural people are making a living: restructuring of agri-food and land markets, rural exodus, labour shortages. These developments are also associated with growing environmental burdens that undermine the sustainability of food production in many regions, because of land and water scarcity and climate-change yield losses.\nAny market in which retailers or distributors are concentrated can suffer from structural competition problems linked to excessive buyer power. A particularly valid example is the agri-food market, in which the size of retailers means that the producers (specially smaller ones) have de-facto only one outlet in where to sell. ","3807":"Algorithmic pricing\nThe widespread use of algorithms as the basis upon which products are tracked and distributed, and consumer behaviour is analysed or competitors\u2019 behaviour is monitored. Technologies linked to algorithmic pricing could be potentially use also to set the terms of purchases. If this happens larger players are potentially better placed to make a widespread use of technology, which offers them yet one more advantage vis-\u00e0-vis smaller players, and in particular smaller producers and suppliers who are de-facto left with no other option but accept the purchasing conditions imposed by downstream larger players. The new complementary tool shall be fit to address these situations if they happen","3808":"In agri-food supply chains we can find monopsony market power through complex oligopolies at the downstream sales level, which are not subject to any sustainable countervailing buyer power by upstream producers or suppliers,  and which are prone to tacit collusion or conscious parallelism.

Consequently, for small producers there is essentially no choice between buyers, since all the buyers have an incentive to not compete with each other (ie. they act like a buying cartel although they are not formally agreeing on the terms and conditions\/prices for buying from the small producers)Please see answers to questions 6 and 7.1","3811":"The Commission shall be able to intervene in oligopolistic markets prone to tacit collusion in order to preserve \/improve competition. \nHigh concentrated market power tends to lead to highly unsustainable\/abusive trade and business practices, for example in the agriculture and food market. Current EU competition policy does not provide sufficient tools to address the issues related to buyer power, and the existing legal tools to address unfair trading practices are very fragmented and not specifically designed to tackle this problem.","3812":"Markets other than digital ones face or can potentially face structural competition problems that the current competition policy framework is not fit to address. For example, in the agricultural and food sector there are massive oligopolistic market structures with tacit collusion in upstream input or downstream distribution markets, anti-competitive strategies to monopolise a particular input or where a distribution platform becomes a gatekeeper for farming products, resulting in inefficient market outcomes in terms of higher prices, lower quality, less choice and innovation.\nThe power gained by large buyers leads to a situation in which they control suppliers up to the production stage, far removed from the model of perfectly competitive markets.  Very similar issues may also occur in other sectors, such as the textile sector.","3813":"\nThere is a growing concentration in sectors such as supermarkets and retailers. For example, in 11 different European countries, fewer than eight retail chains control the vast majority of the nation\u2019s food retail. For example, five retailers made up 85 percent of the German market in 2014 and 77 percent of the Dutch market in 2016. Retail is also continuously concentrating in most European countries.\nThis increased concentration of buyers can result in situations in which they all offer similar conditions, restricting the benefits of both smaller producers (upstream sellers) and consumers. This restriction does not necessarily respond to the description of Article 101, hence the need for the new envisaged complementary tool to be fit to intervene if necessary.\nIt shall be noted that, even in cases in which in the short term there is no expected negative effects on prices (consumer prices remain low in spite of the concentration and the potential tacit collusion), it might end up by negatively impacting future consumers if it results on threatening the survival of small-scale farming, the foreclosure of local grocery stores and the environmental and social implications connected to a shift towards long value chains.The abusive purchasing practices of agri-food sector have been partially addressed by the EU through the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Directive. The fact of that piece of legislation being necessary is rooted in the concentration of power that has allowed downstream players to impose their conditions upon upstream ones. Although part of the issue is solved with the Directive, the root cause (which is concentration of buying power) remains and can hence keep on being problematic, for example making it difficult for other actors to enter the market. This situation is equally conflictive in other markets in which large player exists, but the UTP Directive does not apply like the textile one.Certain markets, in particular very concentrated ones like the agri-food one experiment structural problems that do not qualify as abuse of dominant position according to Article 102. Hence the need for the complementary instrument to be able to address these situations when they happen. \nMoreover, to be in line with the SDGs and the Green Deal, Art. 102 must not only be clear with its existing rules, but also further consider unfair trading practices and broader environmental concerns.Structural problems might occur in markets other than digital ones, in particular in those in which downstream players (buyers) are strong such as the agricultural and food sector, and textile.In the agricultural and food sector there are large oligopolistic market structures with tacit collusion in upstream input or downstream distribution markets, anti-competitive strategies to monopolise a particular input or where a distribution platform becomes a gatekeeper for farming products, resulting in inefficient market outcomes in terms of higher prices, lower quality, less choice and innovation.\nThe EU is experiencing a growing concentration of supermarkets and retailers, as a matter of fact, in 11 different European countries, fewer than eight retail chains control the vast majority of the nation\u2019s food retail. For example, five retailers made up 85 percent of the German market in 2014 and 77 percent of the Dutch market in 2016. This concentration leads to an increased buyer power and puts supermarkets, retailers and International Buying Groups in a position in which upstream sellers, and in particular the smallest ones, are unable to take any other option than the one offered by these large groups. \nThe current competition law framework is unable to address these problems, partially due to the fact that the downward pressure is sometimes considered beneficial insofar as the cost savings are then passed on to consumers. However, it shall be noted that a) it is not always true that the benefits are passed on to the consummer (see : Olivier De Schutter, Addressing Concentration in Food Supply Chains: the Role of Competition Law in Tackling the Abuse of Buyer Power, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Briefing Note 03, 2010); b) the buyer power results often in forcing smaller suppliers to abandon the market, with in the long term has negative effects for the whole market, including consumers. \nThis structural competition problems cannot be addressed in an effective manner by Article 101 nor by 102 TFEU. A new complementary tool is needed. It should not only address the digital market but also the agricultural and food sector and potentially other sectors in which similar problems might exist.","3814":"The ACT welcomes a holistic approach to competition policy that serves Europe\u2019s fundamental goals in matters of \ncultural  diversity and media pluralism.
